  "description": "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS   [0001] This application claims priority to and is a continuation of U.S.  patent application Ser. No. 15/480,914 titled \"System for Connecting  Implement to Mobile Machinery,\" filed Apr. 6, 2017, which claims the  benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/390,693 titled  \"Laterally adjustable 3-point hitch attachment device\" filed Apr. 7, 2016  and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/496,424 titled \"Laterally  adjustable three-point hitch implement apparatus,\" filed Oct. 18, 2016,  the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their  entirety.   BACKGROUND   [0002] Mobile machinery such as agricultural tractors, bulldozers, track  tractors, skip loaders, all-terrain vehicles and earth grading tractors,  generally referred to as a \"tractor,\" typically are provided with a  suitable power plant, a source of fluid under pressure and or a source of  electric current. The fluid pressure source includes suitable valve  control means. The tractors typically include an implement mounting  system known as a three-point hitch. The three-point hitch includes a  pair of opposed spaced apart lateral bottom-link arms located at the rear  of the tractor body or frame rotatably connected to the tractor with ball  joints which are affixed to the frame or body of the tractor at a  selected distance of typically 12 to 30 inches above the ground and  extend on each side of a center draw bar. The free distal ends of the  arms typically include a ball rotatable in a socket with an axial hole  extending there through.   [0003] A third arm, called a top-link arm, is also rotatably connected  with a ball joint to the tractor frame at a point about 30 to 60 inches  above ground and centered above the bottom-link arms. The free distal end  of the top-link arm is fitted with a rotatable ball with an axial hole  extending there through for connecting to a center point on an implement  in alignment with studs. Free ends of the two bottom-link arms and the  top-link arm provide three-points of attachment to implements and  therefore is referred to as a three-point hitch. The length of top-link  arm is generally adjustable by means of a built in turn-buckle assembly.  This provides for manual leveling of the attached implement. The top-link  arm turn buckle assembly can be replaced with a hydraulic cylinder for  quick controlled manual or automated adjustments of the length of the  top-link arm resulting in adjustments of the attached three-point  implement.   [0004] The bottom-link arms are connected to a lift-link arm to provide a  means for lifting such as a suitable power lift mechanism, for example  one or more hydraulic cylinders. This provides the capability to raise  and lower the two bottom-link arms and thus the implement which is  connected to the three-point hitch. Because the free ends of all three  arms are connected to the tractor with ball joint type connections, all  three arms may freely pivot to the left and the right any time the  three-point hitch has the implement raised off the ground. On older  tractors, an additional bar called a stabilizer arm is provided, if  desired, and is connected to one of the first two bottom-link arms and to  a fixed point on the tractor. On newer tractors, two stabilizer arms are  provided, one for each bottom-link arm and they are also connected to a  fixed point on the tractor. The stabilizer arms allow the bottom-link  arms to still be raised and lowered by hydraulic means, but the implement  is held stable with reference to the horizontal plane, and cannot swing  to and fro as before.   [0005] The attached implement can include a transversely extending tool  bar or frame member having laterally spaced apart studs extending from  the front tractor-facing side of the implement for removable attachment  to the sockets held within the distal ends of the bottom-link arms. In  addition to the bottom-link arm attachment hardware means is an upper  attachment hardware means for the attachment of the top-link arm.   [0006] A three-point hitch is standard equipment on most agricultural and  earth grading tractors. The use of a three-point hitch provides lifting,  lowering and tilting mechanisms to attached agricultural implements, such  as agricultural implements. The tractor three-point hitch allows the  attached tool or implement to be raised and lowered, tilted horizontally  and tilted vertically, all such movements and adjustments provided by  hydraulically activated cylinders or manual crank screw devices. Front  three-point hitches, while available, are less common than rear  three-point hitches on agricultural tractors.   [0007] The three-point hitch provides for a quick attachment of various  implements needed on a tractor. In addition, when the implement is in the  raised or lowered position, lateral movement of the three-point  bottom-link arms is freely available. To limit lateral movement of the  implement in the raised or lowered position, the user can add a  stabilizer arm comprising a longitudinal member having a selected  adjustable length attachable to a swing arm attachment point on the  tractor body or frame with the opposing end attaching to the same  implement stud as the adjacent swing arm to limit lateral movement of the  bottom-link arms. Many tractor brands are now factory supplied with  three-point hitch bottom-link stabilizer arms. Controlled lateral  movement of an attached implement is not provided with a three-point  hitch.   [0008] Earth-moving equipment in the construction and farming field has  rapidly changed for the better in recent years with the introduction of  Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and laser guidance systems. Current GPS  guidance systems for earth-moving and agricultural tractors generally are  designed to auto-steer the tractor. Much of the guidance involves  steering the tractor in a straight line to form a straight road or  straight row of crops. Since most agricultural and earth grading tractors  are steered by the front end of the tractor, the rear end mounted  three-point hitch attached implement may not align in a straight line  with the front steered end of the tractor. This misalignment would  normally occur while the tractor is turning 180 degrees around at the end  of the crop row and then joining onto the next crop row in the other  direction. This misalignment would also occur while the tractor is in the  middle of the crop field and the tractor veered slightly off line of the  crop straight line forcing the tractor operator to correct the steering  of the tractor. This steering correction of the tractor can also shift  the rear end of the tractor in the opposite direction of the steering  correction causing the rear three-point connected implement to also veer  off course of the straight crop row and possibly damage the crops while  cultivating the field or misalign the crops while planting. Lasers have  come into play in the earth-moving and agricultural field mostly by  controlling grade leveling implements on the tractor in an up and down  motion for achieving a level or sloped grade.   [0009] Conventional laterally moving implement toolbars pivot on four  parallel supporting arms extending out from the front of the supporting  frame. Short sized supporting arms provide limited lateral movement of  the toolbar section of the implement. The short lateral movement is  exacerbated by the positioning of the tool mounting bar being too close  to the frame structure that mounts to the tractor three-point hitch.  Mounting brackets further decrease the tool mounting bar clearance to the  frame structure. Pivoting-support-arms pivot in either direction limiting  the length of the lateral movement to much less than the length of the  pivoting-support-arms. The weight that these pivoting-support-arms can  support on the toolbar with heavy implements is dependent on the strength  of the pivot arms and their pivot joints. The pivot joints need to  sustain a tremendous weight load when handling a heavy implement as they  pivot side to side. This weight load is compounded and increased if the  pivoting-support-arms are increased in length.   [0010] Two-point hitch configurations present a different set of  limitations for use of lateral connection devices. The three-point hitch  invention differs from a two-point hitch in the mounting ability by  utilizing the advantage of the top-link arm attachment to the tractor  frame, the improved locations for the sleeves that provide the sliding  housings, a more versatile and stable two tier stacked movable implement  attachment section compared to the one movable toolbar and a more stable  and functional two or more tiered stacked movable implement attachment  section compared to the one movable implement attachment section.   [0011] Several patents teach methods of steering and controlling tractor  mounted implement attachment systems to two-point and three-point hitch  systems. U.S. Pat. No. 3,208,535 by Fischer teaches an automatic steering  system for implements; U.S. Pat. No. 7,530,405 by Kollath et al. teaches  a quick coupler mechanism, U.S. Pat. No. 4,019,753 by Kestel teaches an  adjustable three-point tractor hitch; U.S. Pat. No. 4,463,811 by Winter  teaches an implement with a laterally movable frame structure with  limited lateral movement; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,931,234 by Trowbridge  teaches a retractable three-point hitch mounted, vertically and laterally  adjustable toolbar. U.S. Pat. No. 4,930,581 by Fleischer teaches a  guidance control device for agricultural implements using a hydraulic  cylinder to pivot the implement frame and implement to the left or to the  right to correct lateral position with respect to the tractor and the  previously processed rows. U.S. Pat. No. 3,208,535 by Fischer teaches an  automatic steering device and a plant stem sensor.   [0012] Existing systems for pulling or pushing implements suffer from a  significant disadvantage, particularly that the implement can go off  course, particularly during turns. This can result in destroyed crops,  inadequate application or over application of chemicals used for crops,  unplowed soil, and other deleterious effects. These problems can occur  even when the mobile machinery, such as a tractor, is on course.   [0013] Therefore, there is a need for a system that can allow an implement  to be pushed or pulled that helps maintain the implement on track, even  when the mobile machinery used for pulling or pushing the implement is  off track.   SUMMARY   [0014] A system according to the present invention that satisfies this  need includes a connecting apparatus suitable for connecting an implement  to a three-point hitch of mobile machinery, such as a tractor. The  connecting apparatus comprises a first framework disposed in a first  plane and comprising at least two parallel, vertically spaced-apart,  laterally extending rails. Three attachments are supported by the first  framework for attachment to the three-point hitch. The slidable second  framework is generally in the plane of the first framework and is mounted  on the rails to slide laterally along the rails. At least two connectors,  and typically three connectors, are supported by the slidable second  framework for connecting the slidable second framework to an implement  that can be pulled or pushed by the mobile machinery. At least one  driver, and for a robust apparatus, two drivers, are connected to the  first framework and connected to the second framework for driving the  slidable framework laterally back and forth along the rails.   [0015] In use of the apparatus, the position of the implement relative to  the mobile machinery is changed by the action of the driver, the driver  laterally moving the second framework.   [0016] Typically, the first framework comprises an upper cross beam and a  lower cross beam, each cross beam substantially parallel to the rails. In  a preferred version the first framework comprises at least two rails, at  least two vertically extending studs, the upper cross beam, and the lower  cross beam. The upper cross beam can support one of the attachments and  the lower cross beam can support two of the attachments, typically in a  triangular configuration.   [0017] The driver can be at least one hydraulic cylinder or at least one  electric linear actuator.   [0018] When a cylinder is used as part of the driver, the cylinder can be  provided with a stop for limiting lateral movement of the second  framework. The driver can be manually or automatically controlled. The  manual control can be a lever or the like. Also a switch can be provided  for switching between manual and automatic control.   [0019] Preferably there is a guidance system for automatically controlling  the driver to position the slidable second framework in a predetermined  pathway. The guidance system can comprise a GPS receiver, an underground  (buried) or above ground guidance wire, or a position signal receiver for  receiving a laser signal. The guidance system can comprise at least one  GPS positioning receiver mounted on the second framework for receiving  signals from the satellites or ground mounted base relay station to  determine the position of the slidable second framework, and a controller  for receiving position signals from the position signal receiver, the  controller adapted to control the driver to position the slidable second  framework in the predetermined pathway. The GPS guidance system utilizes  data input into a data input monitor to set the predetermined coordinates  of the mobile machinery and the connecting apparatus. GPS guidance can  control the mobile machinery steering in addition to the connecting  apparatus position. GPS positioning of the connecting apparatus in  conjunction with GPS steering of the mobile machinery is an advantage  over GPS steering of the mobile machinery alone while attempting to guide  an attached implement along a predetermined pathway. In a guidance wire  application, the guidance system can comprise at least one sensor mounted  on the second framework for receiving signals from the guidance wire. The  apparatus can comprise a position signal receiver supported by the  slidable second framework for determining the position of the slidable  second framework, and a controller for receiving position signals from  the position signal receiver, the controller adapted to control the  driver to position the slidable second framework in the predetermined  pathway. The guidance system can comprise at least one laser position  receiver for receiving a laser signal from a rotating vertical laser  transmitter, and a controller for processing position signals from the  position signal receiver, the controller adapted to control the driver to  position the slidable second framework in the predetermined pathway. In a  laser guidance application, generally there is no need for data entry  into a data entry monitor. The position of the laser receiver on the  connecting apparatus can position the connecting apparatus and steer the  tractor if tractor steering is preferred.   [0020] The second framework can comprise at least one sleeve for sliding  on at least one rail, and typically multiple sleeves for sliding on  multiple rails.   [0021] To power the driver, the apparatus can include a power receptacle  for receiving power from the mobile machinery, which can be electric  power or hydraulic fluid power.   [0022] For implements that have more than three places for connection,  there can be more than three connectors, such as four or more connectors.   [0023] To assist an operator of the mobile machinery, the apparatus can  include a light fixture and at least one camera.   [0024] In a preferred version of the invention, for robustness, the first  framework comprises four rails, and the second framework comprises four  lateral substantially parallel sleeves connected at their ends by end  posts, each sleeve slidable on one of the rails.   [0025] It is preferred that there be positioning indicia on the upper  cross beam of the first framework for positioning the second framework  relative to the first framework. This same type of positioning indicia  can be used on the lower cross beam of the first framework. Also, there  can be positioning indicia on one or more of the sleeves for adjusting  the position of any connector supported by the sleeve.   [0026] Preferably the apparatus includes a sensor for sensing the position  of the second framework relative to the first framework. This can be  combined with an alert generator that generates an alert, such as a sound  or flashing light, when the sensor senses that the second framework  slides beyond a predetermined position.   [0027] Preferably the apparatus includes a plumb gauge and a level gauge  for correctly adjusting the attitude and positioning of the implement.   [0028] Preferably at least one connector is laterally adjustable on the  second framework. Also preferably at least one connector is vertically  adjustable on the second framework.   [0029] Additionally, the apparatus can include a connection guidance  system for connecting the apparatus to the implement, the connection  guidance system comprising a sensor on at least one, and preferably at  least two, connectors for sensing the position of the implement. With the  connection guidance system, the system can include a method for  connecting the apparatus to the implement, where the implement has  hitches for connector with the connectors. The method comprises placing  the implement and apparatus approximate to each other, determine the  alignment of the connectors and the hitches, and adjusting the alignment  by sliding the second framework relative to the first framework.   [0030] The invention also includes a system where the mobile machinery,  the apparatus described above, and an implement are connected together,  with the apparatus attached to the mobile machinery via the three-point  hitch on the mobile machinery, and the implement attached to the slidable  second framework with at least two connectors.   [0031] The system can also include a pair of support stands for supporting  the apparatus when the apparatus is otherwise not well supported, such as  not being attached to all three points of a three point hitch, each stand  comprising pins for engaging corresponding holes in the vertical studs of  the first framework. Clips can be used for holding the pins in their  engagement position.   [0032] Multiple connection apparatus of the present invention can be daisy  chained together such as having a central apparatus attached to the  mobile machinery, and having an additional pair of the apparatus, each  one of the pair pivotally and removably attached to the sides of the  central apparatus. Each of the pair can be modified from the central  apparatus such as for the driver location and driver connection between  the first and second framework. Each of the outer pair is typically  designed to carry lighter duty implements than the central apparatus.   [0033] A system according the present invention comprises: [0034] a)  mobile machinery having a three-point hitch; [0035] b) the connection  apparatus attached to the mobile machinery with the three attachments;  and [0036] c) an implement attached to the slidable second framework with  at least two connectors.   [0037] In a method of using the system there are the following steps:  [0038] a) placing the implement and apparatus proximate to each other;  [0039] b) determining the alignment of the connectors and the hitches;  and [0040] c) adjusting the alignment by sliding the second framework  relative to the first framework.   [0041] In a method for changing the position of an implement pulled or  pushed by with mobile machinery, the mobile machinery having a  three-point hitch, there are the steps of: [0042] a) attaching the  connection apparatus to the three-point hitch of the mobile machinery  with the three attachments; [0043] b) attaching the implement to the  slidable second framework with the connectors; and [0044] c) changing the  lateral position of the implement relative to the mobile machinery with  the driver.   [0045] According to the invention, a method of attaching an implement to  mobile machinery comprises the steps of: [0046] a) attaching the  connecting apparatus to the mobile machinery with the attachments; [0047]  b) aligning the connectors of the slidable second framework with the  implement by moving the second framework relative to the first framework;  and [0048] c) connecting the connectors to the implement.

and rear three-point hitch  as they are combined with a tractor 38 in the prior art. This side view  shows a Carry-All implement 300 mounted to the front and rear three-point  hitches of a tractor 38. Shown are the three points of attachment of a  three-point hitch to the Carry-All implement 300 using two bottom-link  attachment arms 318 and a top-link attachment arm 324. Two bottom link  attachment arms 318 (see FIG. 2) are generally positioned on the same  horizontal plane unless an application of use requires otherwise. Lift  link arms 330 are visible on the front three-point hitch while not being  visible on the rear three-point hitch being hidden by the larger rear  tires. In many farming and excavating instances a rear three-point hitch  is used by itself without a front three-point hitch being attached to the  tractor 38. Using a combined front and rear three-point hitch can  increase the efficiency of the farming or excavation application if used  properly.   [0298] FIG. 1b shows schematically a system according to the present  invention comprising a first connecting apparatus 40 attached to the  front and rear three-point hitches of a tractor in addition with the  Carry-All implement 300 mounted to the first connecting apparatus 40 at  front and rear locations. The connection apparatus 40 mounts first to the  three-point hitch of the tractor and the Carry-All implement 300 next  mounts to the connection apparatus 40.   [0299] FIG. 1c shows a close-up side view showing a tractor with the  connection apparatus 40 mounted to the rear three-point hitch of a  tractor with the prior art Carry-All implement 300 mounted to the  connection apparatus showing top-link arm 324 attaching to the  rigid-frame top-link attachment 66, and the bottom link arms 318  attaching to the rigid-frame bottom-link connection points 68 of the  connection apparatus 40. Sliding frame bottom-link quick hitch hook and  stop bar 136 attaches the lower portion of the Carry-All implement 300 to  the sliding-frame 46 and sliding-frame top-link hook and stop bar 130  attaches the upper portion of the Carry-All implement 300 to the  sliding-frame 46. The sliding frame can be guided with a system using a  buried guidance wire 141 utilizing a signal generator 143 to activate the  guidance wire 141.   [0300] FIG. 2 shows the prior art implement 300, that includes a top  attachment receiver 312 which usually comprises a pair of spaced apart  aligned projections or flanges centrally disposed and having a hole there  through for receiving a distal end 326 of the top-link arm 324 which is  releasably held thereto by a pin or bolt 310. The distal end 326 can  comprise a socket. The opposing end 322 of the top-link arm 324 also  comprises a distal ball socket for attachment to the tractor top-link  attachment location with similar spaced apart projections and retaining  pin or bolt. The implement 300 typically includes a transversely  extending tool bar or frame member having laterally spaced apart studs  314 extending from the tractor-facing side of the implement frame for  removable attachment to the bottom-link arm 320 sockets held within the  distal ends of the bottom-link arms 318. In the alternative, laterally  spaced apart studs 314 are replaced with two flanges with axial centered  holes 195 (see FIG. 24) with a pin therein for connection to the  bottom-link arms 318. The distal end 326 of the top-link arm 324 and  distal ends 320 of the two bottom-link arms 318 contain within sockets  having rotatable balls including apertures extending there-through for  insertion of pins for connecting these three ends to fixed points on the  implement. The top-link arm 324 includes a turn-buckle assembly with  threaded rods and a threaded hollow cylinder which can be rotated to  lengthen or shorten the overall length of the top-link arm 324.   [0301] FIGS. 3 shows prior art lift-link arms 330 connect at lift-link  arms connection to bottom-link arms 332 that cause the bottom-link arms  318 to rotate upward and downward pivoting the proximate ends of the  bottom-link arms on a spindle and raising the distal end of the  bottom-link arms 320 and the implement attached thereto. The top-link arm  324, in turn, causes the upright portion of the carry-all implement 300  to maintain general uprightness or verticality. Consequently, the  horizontal portion of the implement remains generally horizontal  throughout the upward and downward motion of the carry-all implement 300  (see FIG. 2). Because the bottom-link arms 318 points of attachment to  the tractor under-carriage location 316 are also ball and socket  arrangements, the implement is free to move laterally a fixed distance  providing \"play\" for with respect to the tractor. In some situations,  this freedom of movement is desirable, and in other situations,  undesirable. As in the case of this present invention, the freedom of  movement situation is undesirable, additional stabilizer arms are  connected, one to each of the bottom-link arms. One end of the stabilizer  arms connected approximately half way down the length of each bottom-link  arm 338, the other end is connected to a fixed point on the tractor  under-carriage location 334 which is coaxial with the two bottom-link arm  connections to the tractor under carriage at location 316. This allows  full up and down movement of the implement but removes any random lateral  motion of the implement. The stabilizer arms 336 may be a turn-buckle  assembly with threaded rods and a threaded hollow cylinder which can be  rotated to lengthen or shorten the overall length of the stabilizer arm.  In the alternative, the stabilizer arms may be a rigid arm with an  adjustable threaded screw device located at the bottom-link arm location  338. Another alternative to the above stated stabilizer arms is one or  two stabilizer arms connected to a rigid point on the tractor and the  other end connected crossways to one or both of the bottom-link  connection pins 314 (see FIG. 2) to the implement.   [0302] Bottom-link arms 318 support the weight of the implement. Lift-link  arms 330 attach between the bottom-link arms 318 and tractor hydraulic  actuated lift arms at connection point 328. The adjustable top-link arm  324 attaches to the tractor mounted top-link bracket 340 with a removable  pin or bolt thru the top-link arm distal end 322, which can have a  mounted rotatable ball, while the opposed distal end 326 of the top-link  arm has a rotatable ball and attaches to a top-link attachment plate 312  on the implement as shown in FIG. 2. A Power Take-Off shaft (PTO) (not  shown) can be disposed centered on the rear of the tractor through the  PTO pathway 98 in a plane between the height of the top-link attachment  plates 340 on the tractor and the bottom-link attachments 316 to the  tractor.   [0303] FIG. 5 and FIG. 6 show the tractor-facing side of the laterally  adjustable three-point hitch implement attachment, of a first version of  the invention, comprising a rigidly-mounted base frame 45 (also referred  to as a first framework), and a slidably-mounted frame 46 (also referred  to as a second framework). The rigidly-mounted base frame 45 is  configured for connection to the bottom-link arms 318 and top-link arm  324 of mobile machinery, such as the tractor 38 (see FIG. 1a).  Connections from the tractor to the rigidly-mounted base frame 45 occur  at the top link attachment 66 and at the two bottom-link attachment 68.  The rigidly-mounted base frame 45, also referred to as the first frame,  has at least two parallel, vertically spaced apart, laterally extending  rails. In the version shown in FIG. 5 and FIG. 6, the first frame 45  comprises four tiered horizontal longitudinal frame member rails 48, 49,  50, 51, which can be solid or hollow and any suitable shape in  cross-section, rigidly connected at the ends to at least two vertical  support members, also referred to as studs, and capable of being  removably secured to the three-point hitch of the tractor. Preferably in  the design of the rigidly-mounted base frame there are at least two upper  and two lower horizontal frame members providing an opening of sufficient  size between the upper and lower horizontal frame members to accommodate  a Power Take Off \"PTO\" driveline if required for the attached implement.  The PTO opening arraignment is shown in FIG. 7 using a double driver  configuration allowing for the space needed for the PTO driveline to  connect to an implement. FIG. 5 and FIG. 6 show three upper and three  lower horizontal frame members for the rigidly-mounted base frame showing  the rigidly-mounted base frame with six horizontal longitudinal aligned  frame members, wherein frame member 47 (also referred to as upper cross  beam), 48 and 49 are in an upper position and frame members 50, 51, 52  (member 52 is also referred to as lower cross beam), are in a lower  positions, and four vertical frame members. Frame members 53 and 54, also  referred to as studs, are positioned to one side of the rigidly-mounted  base frame and frame members 55 and 56 are positioned to the opposing  side of the rigidly-mounted base frame. Members 53, 54, 55, and 56 are  also referred to as studs. Members 48, 49, 50, and 51 are also referred  to as rails. The laterally adjustable three-point hitch implement  attachment apparatus 40 has square shaped horizontal sliding-frame  members 57,58,59,60 (also referred to as sleeves) and square shaped  horizontal rigid-frame members 47,48,49,50,51,52 oriented in a diamond  shape with all sides placed at forty-five degree angles as compared to a  horizontal plane. By square shaped this is with regard to a vertical  cross section and preferably they are oriented with a corner facing  upwardly.   [0304] The slidable-mounted frame 46 comprises at least two horizontal  longitudinally aligned hollow frame member tubes securely and sturdily  connected at the ends with at least two vertical frame members forming a  generally rectangular sturdy frame that is transversely and  slidably-mounted on at least two horizontal longitudinal frame members,  bars or rails of the rigidly-mounted base frame 45 enabling the  slidable-mounted frame 46 to travel transversely, also referred to as  laterally, across from one side to the other side of the rigidly-mounted  base frame 45. FIG. 5 shows two upper and two lower horizontal hollow  frame members for the slidably-mounted frame, wherein frame members 57  and 58 are in the upper positions and frame members 59 and 60 are in the  lower positions. They slide on the rails of the base frame 45. Shown in  FIG. 5 are four vertical frame members, two vertical frame members 61 and  62 are positioned to one side and frame members 63 and 64 are positioned  to the opposing side. Frame members 61-64 are also referred to as posts.  Four hollow horizontal slidable-mounted frame members as opposed to two  hollow horizontal slidable-mounted frame members can provide a greater  load carrying capacity of the connecting apparatus.   [0305] The upper horizontal rigidly-mounted base frame members 48 and 49  pass thru the upper slidable-mounted frame members 57 and 58. The lower  horizontal rigidly-mounted base frame members 50 and 51 pass thru the  lower slidable-mounted frame members 59 and 60. The slidable-mounted  frame 46 is free to laterally move with respect to the rigidly-mounted  base frame 45. All six rigidly-mounted base frame members and all four  slidable-mounted frame members are typically vertically coplanar. While  FIG. 5 and subsequent figures show a frame made from longitudinal members  having a rectangular or square cross-section, it is contemplated that  longitudinal members may be formed having a cylindrical cross-sectional  area such as pipes or solid rods (see FIG. 39b). FIG. 5 and subsequent  figures show the square frame members turned in a diagonal horizontal  position representing a diamond shape, the connecting apparatus would  also work in a similar fashion with the frame members turned in the  square position with the bottom and top of the frame members situated in  a horizontal squared position (see FIG. 39a) as opposed to a forty-five  degree diamond slanted position when compared to a horizontal plane.   [0306] As depicted in subsequent drawings, (see FIGS. 13, 14, 15, 16) a  lighter more economical version of the connecting apparatus 40 as  depicted in FIG. 5 can be configured with only two hollow horizontal  frame members included in the slidably-mounted frame 46 and only four  horizontal frame members included in the rigidly-mounted base frame 45.  (see FIGS. 13, 14, 15, 16) In addition to the connecting apparatus as  depicted in FIG. 5, a larger stronger version of the connecting apparatus  can be configured by increasing the number of horizontal frame members  included in the slidably-mounted frame to six or more (not shown) and  increasing number of horizontal frame members in the rigidly-mounted  frame to eight or more. (not shown) Also in addition to adding horizontal  and vertical frame members to gain more strength and weight carrying  capacity of the connecting apparatus, using a stronger or greater  diameter and thickness of the metal used in all of the frame members will  achieve a greater weigh carrying and working capacity. For great weight  carrying and working capacity of the connecting apparatus, all of the  rigidly-mounted base frame horizontal frame members can be constructed of  solid steel bars.   [0307] FIG. 6 shows a single location of top-link attachment plate 66 and  two locations of bottom-link attachment plates 68 located on the  rigidly-mounted frame 45, which are for attachment to the tractor  top-link and bottom-link points, respectively, of the three-point hitch.  Four horizontal sliding-frame members or sleeves are shown. Pushing or  pulling means such as a hydraulic actuator and cylinder, electric  actuator and cylinder, pneumatic actuator and cylinder, other positioning  devices, chain, cable, belt or combinations thereof are provided for  moving the slidable-mounted frame 46 laterally and parallel to the  rigidly-mounted frame 45.   [0308] For example, a single hydraulic driver 80 is mounted for the  lateral adjustments of the sliding-frame 46. The hydraulic driver 80  provides lateral movement of the slidably-mounted frame 46 across the  rigidly-mounted base frame 45. The slidably-mounted frame 46 is free to  slide laterally with respect to the base frame 45. The left-right  movement and position of slidably-mounted frame 46 is changed by at least  one hydraulic driver 80 comprising a housing 82 and a piston 83, or  optionally more than one driver, such as two hydraulic drivers 80 (see  FIG. 7). Typically, the driver has an internal stop for limiting the  lateral movement of the slidably-mounted frame 46. The hydraulic driver  is connected between the rigidly-mounted base frame 45 and the  slidably-mounted frame 46. The cylinder housing 82 of the hydraulic  driver 80 is removably attached at one end to a bracket 90 with a pin and  clip and the bracket 90 is connected to bracket 92b which is connected to  the rigidly-mounted base frame 45 at vertical frame member 56. The piston  83 of the hydraulic driver 80 is removably attached to a bracket 89 with  a pin and clip and the bracket 89 is connected to a bracket 94b which is  connected to the slidably-mounted frame 46 at the vertical frame member  61. In this configuration, when the piston 83 of the hydraulic driver 80  moves out of the housing 82, the slidably-mounted frame 46 is caused to  slide away from the bracket 90 of the rigidly-mounted base frame 45. When  the piston 83 of the hydraulic driver 80 moves back into housing 82, the  slidably-mounted frame 46 is caused to move closer to the bracket 90 of  the rigidly-mounted base frame 45. The hydraulic cylinder housing 82 has  two hydraulic flexible lines 85 attached which in turn can be attached to  a tractor manual hydraulic control valve 236 and the automated hydraulic  control valve 238. The driver 80 can be operated manually or  automatically.   [0309] The single hydraulic cylinder 80 is mounted in a centered location  between the top and bottom of the sliding-frame 46 for lateral adjustment  of the sliding-frame 46. The single hydraulic cylinder centered design  can be used when a Power Take Off \"PTO\" driveline is not required for the  implement that is attached to the connection apparatus as this centered  single hydraulic cylinder position would obstruct the pathway 98 of a PTO  driveline (see FIG. 7) as it is connected between the tractor PTO shaft  and the implement to be attached to the connection apparatus.   [0310] The driver typically has static loading capacity, meaning that when  the driver stops and reaches a predetermined adjustment point, the driver  essentially locks in place and can support a load that is either pulling  or pushing on the driver. Typically, in an agricultural tractor  application, the tractor hydraulic system control valves and hydraulic  cylinders are valved for a static loading capacity. Typical electric  linear actuators that are screw or gear driven generally have a static  loading capacity or an electro-mechanical brake added to provide improved  static loading capacity.   [0311] Preferably hydraulic drivers are used as compared to electric,  sprocket and chain drives, pneumatic drives and electro-magnetic drives.  Hydraulic actuators are rugged and suited for high-force applications.  They can produce forces 25 times greater than pneumatic cylinders of  equal size. They also operate in pressures of up to 4,000 psi.   [0312] Electric motor actuator drives are weak and usually expensive  compared to hydraulic cylinder movement applications. Electrical  actuators can be used, because they have fewer component parts and can  provide precision-control positioning. An example of the range of  accuracy is +/-0.0003 in. and a repeatability of less than 0.00004 in.  Their setups are scalable for any purpose or force requirement, and are  quiet, smooth, and repeatable. The initial unit cost of an electrical  actuator is higher than that of pneumatic and hydraulic actuators.   [0313] Sprocket and chain drives can be used, but they have slack between  the parts causing less precise movement when compared to a hydraulic  cylinder positioning system.   [0314] Pneumatic cylinder drives can be used but they have limited  position control Electro-magnetic actuators such as linear motor  actuators, although possible in this application, generally do not  possess sufficient force capacity for linear movement. Linear motor  actuators do have the advantage of being able to be sealed very easily  against moisture and corrosion allowing for a long service life. As  technology advances, electro-magnetic actuators may be a preferred choice  in many applications. Mechanical actuator means only of controlling the  driver may be useful in a limited number of applications using mobile  machinery.   [0315] Manual operational control of the hydraulic or electric driver can  be preferred in some applications while using the connecting apparatus. A  switch switching between manual and automatic control of the driver can  be provided along with a manual control valve or switch. One instance  when manual control of the driver may be utilized is when then mobile  machine operator is attaching or removing implements from the connecting  apparatus. The manually operated valve or switch would provide manual  lateral positioning of the connecting apparatus slidable frame for hookup  of an implement. Another instance where manual operation of the driver  may be utilized is when the mobile machine operator has no automatic  guidance system setup for use or the mobile machine operator simply  prefers the manual operation of the driver in certain applications.   [0316] Also shown in FIG. 6 is the rear face of the double wrap-around  bracket clamps 78, which are used for the opposing implement side  connection.   [0317] Attachment plates 66 are mounted on the tractor facing side of the  rigidly-mounted base frame 45 top horizontal frame member 47 for  connection of the top-link arm 324 (see FIG. 1c) to the tractor top-link  attachment brackets 340 (see FIG. 3). Two attachment plates 68 are  mounted on the tractor facing side of the rigidly-mounted base frame 45  bottom horizontal frame member 52 for hookup of the tractor bottom-link  arms 318 (see FIG. 3) to the connecting apparatus. Top-link attachment  plates 66 includes two vertical parallel plates or flanges defining a  bracket with coaxial aligned thorough holes projecting outward or upward  from the surface of the rigidly-mounted base frame top horizontal member  47 which provides for connecting a top-link arm 324 (see FIG. 1b) to the  tractor. Bottom-link attachment plates 68 include two vertical parallel  plates or flanges defining a bracket with coaxial aligned thorough holes  projecting outward or outward and upward from the surface of the  rigidly-mounted base frame bottom horizontal member 52 which provides for  connecting the two bottom-link arms 318 (see FIG. 3) of the tractor to  the rigidly-mounted base frame 45.   [0318] At least four grease fittings 74 for each horizontal frame member  of the slidable-mounted frame 46 are provided to lubricate the sliding  action of the slidable-mounted frame 46 upon the rigidly mounted frame  45. Optimally, sixteen or more grease fittings are provided for each  horizontal frame member of the slidably-mounted frame 46 for complete  coverage of lubricant between the two frames. Grease fittings 74 are  shown mounted on the slidable-mounted frame 46 screwed into threaded  holes or fittings on all sliding horizontal frame members of the  sliding-frame 46.   [0319] Shown in FIG. 6 are viewable rigid-frame alignment marks 70, also  referred to as positioning indicia, located on the upper rigid-frame  horizontal frame member 47 marking the edge of the sliding-frame when the  sliding-frame is centered on the rigid frame, the rigid-frame alignment  marks 70 located on the lower rigid-frame horizontal frame member 52  marking the edge of the sliding-frame when the sliding-frame is centered  on the rigid frame. A rigid-frame alignment mark 72, also referred to as  positioning indicia, is located on the lower rigid-frame horizontal frame  member 52 for marking the center of the sliding-frame when the  sliding-frame is centered on the rigid-frame. This allows centering of  the slidable frame. For the upper rigid-frame horizontal frame member 47,  the rigid-frame top-link attachment plates 66 serves as a center mark.  The hydraulic cylinder 80 length and rigidly-mounted frame section 45  width can be altered depending on the length of lateral movement required  of the sliding-frame section 46.   [0320] FIG. 6 shows the hydraulic lines 85 connected between the hydraulic  driver 80 and both the manual hydraulic control valve 236 and the  automatic hydraulic control valve 238. FIG. 7 show hydraulic lines 87  connected between a hydraulic flow divider 88 and both the manual  hydraulic control valve 236 and the automatic hydraulic control valve  238. FIG. 6 and FIG. 7 show hydraulic lines 87a connected between the  manual hydraulic control valve 236 and a hydraulic valve selector switch  240. Hydraulic lines 87b are connected between the automatic hydraulic  control valve 238 and the hydraulic valve selector switch 240. Hydraulic  lines 87c are connected between the hydraulic valve selector switch 240  and the hydraulic pump 81. Hydraulic power receptacle 242 comprising dual  quick connect couplers serve as the hydraulic power receptacle and  connect and disconnect means for the hydraulic lines when attaching or  removing the first connecting apparatus 40 from the tractor three-point  hitch.   [0321] With reference to FIG. 7, a laser receiver and a GPS antenna and  receiver module 110e is also shown mounted on the top bar 100a. A choice  can be made as to which receiver and controller is used depending on the  application. Both receivers normally are not used at the same time. A GPS  controller can be required to be matched to the GPS antenna and receiver  module 110e; likewise, a laser controller can be required to be matched  to the laser receiver 110. Each receiver receives a signal from a  transmitter and then relays a signal that can be digital or analog or  other to the controller 150 through signal wire 110d or 110f. A data  entry monitor 150b can be provided if required to enter data to the  controller such as in the case of the GPS controller. Data wire 150c is  connected from the data entry monitor 150b to the controller 150. (see  FIGS. 6 and 7) The controller 150 sends a signal 150a to the automatic  hydraulic control valve 238. (see FIGS. 6 and 7) In the instance where an  electric actuator is used for the driver 80, FIG. 4b shows the  configuration of the electrical components for the operation of the  driver 80.   [0322] FIG. 7 shows a double hydraulic cylinder providing lateral movement  of the slidably-mounted frame 46 across the rigidly-mounted base frame  45. The double hydraulic cylinder design can be used when a Power Take  Off (\"PTO\") driveline is required for the implement that is attached to  the connection apparatus, as this double hydraulic cylinder design  normally does not obstruct the pathway of a PTO driveline as it is  connected between the tractor PTO shaft and the implement to be attached  to the connection apparatus. In addition, heavy loads that may be mounted  on the connection apparatus can benefit from the double hydraulic  cylinder design by spreading out the push-pull force of the hydraulic  cylinders to two locations of the sliding-frame 46 instead of one  location. The slidably-mounted frame 46 is free to slide laterally with  respect to the base frame 45.   [0323] The left-right movement and position of slidably-mounted frame 46  is controlled by two hydraulic drivers 80. Each hydraulic driver is  connected between the rigidly-mounted base frame 45 and the second  slidably-mounted frame 46. The housing 82 (see FIG. 6) of the top  hydraulic cylinder 80 is connected at one end to the bracket 90 which is  connected to brackets 92a which are connected to the rigidly-mounted base  frame 45 at vertical frame member 56. The piston 83 of the top hydraulic  driver 80 is connected at one end to the bracket 89 which is connected to  bracket 94a which is connected to the slidably-mounted frame 46 at  vertical frame member 61. The housing 82 of the bottom hydraulic driver  80 is connected at one end to the bracket 90 which is connected to  bracket 92c which is connected to the rigidly-mounted base frame 45 at  vertical frame member 56. The piston 83 of the bottom hydraulic driver 80  is connected at one end to the bracket 89 which is connected to bracket  94c which is connected to the slidably-mounted frame 46 at vertical frame  member 61. In this double hydraulic driver configuration, when the  pistons 83 of the hydraulic drivers 80 moves out of hydraulic housing,  the slidably-mounted frame 46 is caused to slide away from the bracket 90  of the base frame 45. When the pistons 83 of the hydraulic driver 80  moves back into the housings 82, slidably-mounted frame 46 is caused to  move closer to brackets 90 of the base frame 45. In the double hydraulic  cylinder configuration, the hydraulic fluid flow divider 88 is utilized  to provide even distribution of hydraulic fluid to each hydraulic driver  80, causing both hydraulic drivers 80 to be synchronized with each other  while moving in parallel to provide the lateral movement of the  slidably-mounted frame 46 with respect to the rigidly-mounted base frame  45. Hydraulic lines 86 are disposed between each hydraulic cylinder 80  and the hydraulic fluid flow divider 88 for even fluid distribution to  the hydraulic cylinders 80 while hydraulic lines 87 are disposed between  the hydraulic fluid flow divider 88 and the hydraulic control valve  normally equipped on a tractor carrying the connecting apparatus. The  double hydraulic cylinder configuration can be helpful in moving the  slidably-mounted frame 46 when the implement to be carried by the  connecting apparatus is of the larger and heavier nature.   [0324] With reference to FIGS. 7 and 8, a top-bar first bar 100a is  rigidly attached to the slidably-mounted frame section 46 with attachment  legs 101. The top-bar first bar 100a supports (i) a laterally adjustably  positioned laser receiver 110 or a GPS antenna and receiver module 110e  provided with an adjustable holding bracket 108 for supporting a GPS or a  laser guidance system, (ii) an LED light fixture 118, and (iii) mounted  camera housing 112 comprising two cameras 114 and 116 focused rearwardly  and downwardly, respectively, being mounted on a slidable bar 104 for  lateral adjustment. The separate viewing cameras 114 and 116 are enclosed  in the camera housing 112. Top-bar 100a has a top-bar plate 100c for the  mounting of the GPS antenna and receiver module 110e with dual antennas  (see FIG. 11). The slidably-mounted frame 46 horizontal frame members and  the top-bar first bar 100a have indicia markings, also referred to as  positioning indicia, laid down in inches or millimeters thereon, to  provide useful adjustment marks. Laser receiver 110 has a left alignment  indicator 110a, center alignment indicator 110b and a right alignment  indicator 110c. The top-bar first bar 100a extends laterally beyond the  slidable frame 46 as is needed. A position-sensor 151 is attached to  the-top-bar mounting leg 101. A position-sensor bar 151a is attached to  the rigid-frame horizontal frame member 47 with position-sensor bar  attachment brackets 152, with position sensor electrical wires 152a  extending from position sensor bar 151a.   [0325] With reference to FIG. 7, optionally the position signal receiver  110 or 110e, such as a GPS or laser signal receiver, supported by the  slidable second framework, can determine the position of slidable second  framework, and can provide a position signal through signal wires 110d or  110f the controller 150. The controller 150 is adapted to control the  driver 80 for keeping the implement on track via the controller output  signal 150a to the automated hydraulic valve that controls the driver 80.  A suitable programmed controller 150 that can provide output signals can  be obtained from by Trimble of Sunnyvale, Calif. for either the laser or  GPS system.   [0326] FIG. 8 is a perspective view of the implement-facing side of the  connecting apparatus 40. The slidably-mounted frame 46 provides  connection means for most three-point hitch implements in the  agricultural and earth excavating fields, such as bed shapers, seed  planters, plant transplanters, cultivators, weeders, sprayers, rippers,  box scrapers and the like. The slidably-mounted frame 46 is fitted with  two double-frame member wrap around bracket clamps 78, which are mounted  to the slidably-mounted horizontal frame sleeves 59 and 60. Sliding-frame  bottom-link mounting arms 132 attach to two double wrap-around bracket  clamps 78 which protrude out towards the implement to be attached.  Sliding-frame bottom-link quick-hitch slip-on housing 135, as described  in U.S. Pat. No. 7,059,419, attach and secure over the sliding-frame  bottom-link mounting arms 132. (see FIG. 23) The bottom-link attachment  points are normally spaced between 20 and 36 inches apart in a centered  location on the slidably-mounted frame 46 and located near the horizontal  plane of sliding-frame member 60. The slidably-mounted frame 46 is also  fitted with a top-link quick hitch attachment point attached to the  double wrap-around bracket clamp 78 which is mounted to slidably-mounted  horizontal frame members 57 and 58. The top-link quick hitch attachment  point is normally horizontally centered between left and right on the  slidably-mounted frame 46 and adjustably located near or between the  horizontal planes of sliding-frame members 57 and 58. The two  sliding-frame bottom-link attachment hooks 136 and latching mechanism 139  combined with the sliding-frame top-link hook 130 provides for quick and  easy attachment of a three-point hitch implement such as the carry-all  300 (see FIG. 2) and serve as connectors.   [0327] The rigid-frame alignment marks 70 are located on the top  rigid-frame horizontal frame member 47 marking the edge of the  sliding-frame when the sliding-frame is centered on the rigid frame. The  rigid-frame alignment mark 72 located on the top rigid-frame horizontal  frame member 47 marks the center of the sliding-frame when the  sliding-frame is centered on the rigid frame. Rigid-frame alignment marks  70 located on the bottom rigid-frame horizontal frame member 52 mark the  edge of the sliding-frame when the sliding-frame is centered on the rigid  frame. The rigid-frame alignment mark 72 located on the bottom  rigid-frame horizontal frame member 52 marks the center of the  sliding-frame when the sliding-frame is centered on the rigid frame.   [0328] With reference to FIGS. 14 and 23, there is shown the sliding-frame  bottom-link mounting arms 132 and rotatable ball joints 134 that are  normally located on the end of a tractor's bottom-link arms 318. (see  FIG. 1c) Serving as the bottom connector on the sliding frame is a  quick-hitch slip on housing 135 as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,059,419.  Connector 135 securely mounts over the sliding-frame bottom-link mounting  arms 132. The sliding-frame bottom-link quick hitch slip on housing 135  and latching mechanism 139 allow for a quick hookup and release of the  implement from the tractor bottom-link arms. Direct hookup of  sliding-frame bottom-link mounting arms 132 (see FIG. 14) to the  implement is a more cumbersome hookup procedure as compared to the quick  hitch style of implement hookup, although this direct sliding-frame  bottom-link mounting arm 132 hookup may provide a more secure and tighter  fit to the implement in very precise method of use applications. The  quick hitch slip on housing 135, U.S. Pat. No. 7,059,419 includes a hook  means 136 open at the top and a manually or spring operated latch 139 as  shown in a close up view (see FIG. 23). This close-up view shows the slip  on housing slips over the sliding-frame bottom-link mounting arm 132 and  is then held in place by a pin which enters the slip on housing 135 and  then extends through the rotatable socket and ball with axial hole of arm  132. Additional securing and adjustment screws are located around the  slip on housing 135 for fine adjustments and a tight level fit.   [0329] With reference to FIG. 8, the top-link quick hitch attachment  comprises a top-link channel back spacer 119 to vertically align the  top-link quick hitch attachment points with the sliding-frame bottom-link  quick hitch attachment points 136. An additional top-link bracket spacer  121 is attached between the double wrap around bracket clamp 78 and the  top-link channel back spacer 119 to provide access to the double  wrap-around bracket clamp 78 mounting bolts. Attached to the top-link  channel back spacer 119 is an adjustable mounting channel 122. Bolted  into the adjustable mounting channel 122 is a sliding-frame top-link hook  and stop bar 130 top-link channel side spacers 120 inserted and bolted  through. The sliding-frame top-link hook 130 generally is deeper and  longer than the sliding-frame bottom-link quick-hitch hook and stop bar  136, the sliding-frame top-link hook 130 does not generally perform  lifting functions of the attached implements, the sliding-frame top-link  hook 130 hooks under and then up to catch the top-link hookup connection  on the implement 312 (see FIG. 2) and holds the implement in place and  allows the adjustment of tilting forward and backwards performed by the  tractor mounted top-link arm 324. (see FIG. 1c) Top-link arm 324 is  mounted to the tractor at location 340 (see FIG. 3) and to the connecting  apparatus, and in many applications can be a double action hydraulic  cylinder performing tilting adjustments for the attached implement.   [0330] FIG. 9 is a perspective view of the implement facing side of the  connecting apparatus, showing the sliding-frame bottom-link housing 138  attached to the adjustable mounting channel 122 which traverses the four  horizontal frame members 57, 58, 59, 60 of the sliding-frame 46. The  adjustable mounting channel 122 attaches to two double wrap-around  bracket clamps 78 of the sliding-frame 46. The adjustable mounting  channel 122 in this configuration can provide additional bottom-link  higher or lower adjustments and added strength to the sliding-frame 46  while allowing space for an implement PTO driveline to pass through the  connecting apparatus from the implement being carried to the tractor PTO  shaft. A sliding-frame bottom-link quick-hitch bolt-on housing 138 can be  provided in place of the sliding-frame bottom-link quick-hitch slip-on  housing 135, U.S. Pat. No. 7,059,419. The sliding-frame bottom-link  quick-hitch bolt-on housing 138 can be a more stable attachment for the  bottom-link connection point to the implement of the connecting apparatus  as compared to the sliding-frame bottom-link quick-hitch slip-on housing  135. In the alternative for connecting an implement to the connecting  apparatus, the sliding-frame bottom-link mounting arm and ball socket,  bolt-on 133, as shown in FIG. 20, can be used in place of the  sliding-frame bottom-link quick-hitch bolt-on housing 138 to provide a  more stable attachment of the implement to the connecting apparatus. The  position-sensor 151 sliding-frame mounted is attached to a top-bar  mounting leg 101.   [0331] The position-sensor bar 151a is rigid-frame mounted, and is  attached to the top rigid-frame horizontal frame member 47 with  position-sensor bar attachment brackets 152. Position sensor electrical  wires 152b and the position sensor bar electrical wires 152a extend from  both position sensor 151 and position sensor bar 151a to provide the  conductors for the position sensor signal 151b and the position sensor  bar signal 151c. Optionally a wireless connection can be used. The  position sensor 151 and the position sensor bar 151a can send a visual  screen signal 153e for an operator's viewable positioning screen 153d for  the tractor operator to view the position of the slidable-frame 46  position as related to the rigid-frame 45 position while looking forward  and away from the rear three-point hitch mounted connecting apparatus.  This allows the tractor operator to reposition the rigid-frame 45 by  repositioning the tractor using the tractors steering if the tractor is  diverging from the prescribed path. Auto-steering of the tractor can also  be utilized by configuring the position sensor 151 and the position  sensor bar 151a with an automated auto-steer controller 153 utilizing an  auto-steer controller signal 153a sent to the auto-steer device 153b to  control the steering of the tractor. The auto-steer controller can be  equipped with an auto-steer controller on-off switch 153c to allow the  tractor operator to manually steer the tractor when necessary.   [0332] In the instance the auto-steer function is utilized, and in the  instance the tractor is to be steered in a straight line only by the  auto-steer function, mounting the connecting apparatus on the rear  three-point hitch of a front wheel steered tractor is sufficient to keep  the tractor in a straight line. In the instance a front wheel steered  tractor is required to auto-steer in a path that is not a straight line  such as turns, the connecting apparatus 40 can be mounted on the front of  the tractor for precise steering along a predetermined path. In this  instance the present apparatus 40 can be mounted on the front three-point  hitch of the tractor and another apparatus 40 can be mounted on the rear  three-point hitch of the tractor depending on the application and  implements being used. In the alternative to mounting the apparatus 40 on  the front of a front wheel steered tractor in a situation where the  predetermined path follows turns and the apparatus 40 is required to be  mounted on the rear three-point hitch of the tractor, a separate auto  steer device can be mounted on the front of the tractor to achieve  sufficient auto-steering results in a predetermined path following turns.   [0333] Optionally for mobile machinery equipped with an auto-steering  system 153 and 153b, such as those provided by Trimble of Sunnyvale,  Calif., the position sensor 151 sensing the position of the second  framework relative to the first framework, can use the auto-steer system  for automatically adjusting the position of the mobile machinery based on  the sensed position of the second framework relative to the first  framework. Current auto-steering devices work by either controlling the  hydraulic fluid of the mobile machinery hydraulic steering system or  controlling the mechanical steering wheel of the mobile machinery.   [0334] FIG. 10 is a perspective view of the implement facing side of the  connecting apparatus 40, showing the adjustable mounting channel 122  attached to the double wrap around bracket clamp 78 comprising a two  horizontal frame member channel mounting configuration of the  sliding-frame for the bottom-link connections to the implement. This  configuration expands the pathway 98 for a PTO driveline as compared to  FIG. 9. Grease fittings, also referred to as great joints 74, are shown.  Two viewable gauges level measurement 146 are secured to a gauge mounting  plate 145 mounted on the top and at each end of the rigid-frame top  horizontal frame member 47, and situated to be viewed from the rear of  the tractor such as from the tractor seat area allowing the tractor  operator to view and adjust the connecting apparatus accordingly. Two  viewable gauges plumb measurement 147 are mounted on the side, near the  top of each rigid-frame vertical frame member 53 and 56. One auto-sensor  gauge level measurement 148 is mounted on one of the gauge mounting  plates 145 situated on the rigid-frame horizontal frame member 47. One  auto-sensor gauge plumb measurement 149 is mounted on the side, near the  top of rigid-frame vertical frame member 53. The auto-sensor devices can  automate the level and plumb positions of the connecting apparatus  utilizing the tractor installed hydraulic positioning of the tractors  three-point hitch. This automated leveling and plumbing of the connecting  apparatus requires the tractor three-point hitch to accommodate  controlled hydraulic cylinders at the top-link arm 324 and on at least  one of the bottom-link arms 318.   [0335] A bottom-bar 140 is mounted on the bottom of the slidable-mounted  frame 46 and below the sliding-frame bottom-link 138, and below a double  wrap-around bracket clamp 78 being securely fastened to the  slidable-mounted frame 46 with bottom-bar mounting legs 142. Bottom-bar  sensor or cameras 144 are securely mounted to the underside of the  bottom-bar 140, in the case of sensors, for the detection of electronic  signals transmitted from an underground buried cable in which the  slidable-mounted frame 46 adjusts laterally to follow the path of the  signal transmitted from the underground buried cable. In the case of  cameras, recognition computer software can be used to detect the position  of crops or other items like line markers or shapes to adjust the  slidably-mounted frame 46 in position. Bottom-bar signal wire 144a can  transmit the signal to controller 150 (see FIG. 6) utilizing the same  configuration of controller and related equipment as shown in FIG. 6.  Bottom-bar 140 is extendable horizontally past the ends of the  rigidly-mounted frame 45 to accommodate a particular purpose and also be  repositioned if needed on a higher plane on the slidable-mounted frame  46.   [0336] FIG. 11 is a perspective view of the implement facing side of the  connecting apparatus, showing a four-point implement connection design in  a double-link top-link configuration 155 of the sliding-frame 46 as it  connects to a four-point bracketed implement. Two sliding-frame  bottom-link quick hitch attachments with bolt-on housings 138 and two  sliding-frame top-link hook and stop bar 130 (see FIG. 12) attachments  are shown. The sliding-frame 46 bottom-link quick-hitch bolt-on housings  138 are attached to the adjustable mounting channel 122 which traverses  four horizontal frame members 57, 58, 59, 60 of the sliding-frame 46. The  adjustable mounting channel 122 mounts to two double wrap-around bracket  clamps 78 of the sliding-frame 46 and the two sliding-frame top-link hook  and stop bar 130 connections are mounted on the same adjustable mounting  channel 122 aligned vertically and at or near the horizontal plane of the  sliding-frame horizontal frame members 57 and 58. A camera monitor 117  and camera data transfer wire 113 can be mounted near the mobile  machinery operator for viewing the two cameras output data. A top bar  plate 100c houses two GPS antennae and a GPS receiver module as one unit  referred to as a GPS antenna and receiver module 110e.   [0337] FIG. 12 is a perspective view of the implement facing side of the  connecting apparatus, with a four-point implement connection design in  the double-link top-link configuration 155 of the sliding-frame 46 as it  connects to a four-point bracketed implement. Two sliding-frame  bottom-link quick hitch attachments with slip-on housings 135 attach to  sliding-frame bottom-link mounting arms 132 which are attached to double  wrap-around brackets clamps 78, shown are two sliding-frame top-link hook  and stop bar 130 attachments to complete the four-point implement  attachment configuration. Rigid-mounted frame section vertical frame  members 53 and 56 have stand mounting holes 164. A double top-bar second  bar 100b is mounted above top-bar first bar 100a using top-bar mounting  leg extensions 105. This configuration provides a flexible laser receiver  adjustment range. There is provided a wide laser receiver 111 with wide  laser receiver left alignment indicator 111a, wide laser receiver center  alignment indicator 111b, and wide laser receiver right alignment  indicator 111c.   [0338] FIG. 13 is a perspective view of the implement facing side of the  connecting apparatus, showing a version of the connecting apparatus with  the sliding frame comprising four horizontal frame members wherein two of  the horizontal frame members are sliding members 57 and 60 and the  remaining two horizontal frame members are support members 156 and 158 in  a diamond position to accommodate the double wrap-around bracket clamps  78. In the case of a slightly reduced weight load on the connecting  apparatus, four horizontal sliding-frame members may not be needed.  Consequently, two horizontal sliding-frame members which slide on the  rigidly-mounted base frame 45 horizontal members are provided, while two  additional sliding-frame horizontal members do not contact the  rigidly-mounted base frame and thus are utilized as support members only.  Stand mounting holes 164 are positioned between the upper and lowers  rigid-mounted base frame members. Implement positioning sensors or  cameras 154 are mounted to the implement facing side bottom-links and the  implement facing side top link. Implement positioning sensors or cameras  154 can be utilized and wired to controller 150 (see FIG. 6) for  assisting in the connection of the implements to the connecting apparatus  by adjusting the position of the sliding-frame to align the first  connection apparatus 40 implement facing side bottom and top links with  the implement bottom and top link attachment pins or hardware.   [0339] FIG. 14 is a perspective view showing the connecting apparatus of  FIG. 13, showing the two sliding-mounted frame bottom-link connections as  sliding-frame bottom-link mounting arm and ball sockets 132 without the  bottom-link quick-hitch slip-on housing.   [0340] FIG. 15 is a perspective view showing the connecting apparatus of  FIG. 14, showing the two sliding-frame bottom-link connections as  bottom-link mounting arm and ball sockets extended length 137 without the  sliding-frame bottom-link quick-hitch slip-on housings 135 attached  thereon. Shown is a four-point implement connection design in the  double-link top-link configuration 155. Sliding-frame bottom-link  mounting arm and ball sockets extended length 137 may be required for a  recessed implement mount at the bottom-link connection on an implement.   [0341] FIG. 16 is a perspective view of the connecting apparatus of FIG.  13 with the implement-facing side showing the double wrap-around brackets  clamps 78 replaced with single wrap-around bracket clamps 76 and shows  adjustable mounting channel 122 when there is a reduced weight load on  the connecting apparatus. Two sliding-frame horizontal frame members 160  and 162 used as support members are mounted in a square position,  sliding-frame horizontal support member square 160 for the upper member  and sliding-frame horizontal support member square 162 for the lower  member.

Hydraulic cylinder attachment bracket to piston arm 83  is attached between the hydraulic cylinder piston arm and the hydraulic  cylinder brace 94c to sliding-frame. This lower situated hydraulic  cylinder configuration allows the use of a PTO driveline utilizing the  pathway for a PTO driveline 98 from the tractor to the implement.   [0342] FIG. 17 is a perspective view showing an alternative design of a  second connecting apparatus 41 in a more compact-design as compared to  the previously disclosed upright-design 40 wherein the top and bottom  rigidly-mounted horizontal frame members 47 and 52 as depicted in FIG. 5  are moved forward and level with the adjoining rigidly-mounted horizontal  frame members 48 and 51. The new forwardly mounted rigidly-mounted frame  members are numbered 172 for the top member and 174 for the bottom member  for the purpose of this compact-design 41 as shown in FIG. 17 and FIG.  18. Rigid-frame top-link attachment 66 is attached to rigidly-mounted  frame member 172 and two rigid-frame member bottom-link attachments 68  are connected to rigidly-mounted frame member 174. The compact-design 41  of the connecting apparatus has shortened rigid-frame vertical studs 180,  182, 184, 186 with two forward mounted rigid-frame vertical members 176  and 178. Four rigid-frame braces 188 between forward mounted horizontal  frame member 172 and rigid-mounted frame member 48 are shown. Two of the  four rigid-frame braces 188 between forward mounted horizontal frame  member 174 and rigid-mounted frame member 51 are shown. Rigid-frame  braces 188 can be installed on these two members to mirror the frame  braces for the top forward horizontal rigid-frame bar 172. The  compact-design 41 of the connecting apparatus provides a lower elevation  plane of the implement facing side sliding-frame bottom-link connections  136 and the sliding-frame top-link 130 connection as compared to the  upright-design 40 of the connecting apparatus. The compact-design 41  disposes the rigidly-mounted frame top-link attachment 66 on or near the  same horizontal plane as the sliding-frame top-link connection 130 and  also disposes the rigidly-mounted frame bottom-link attachment 68 on or  near the same horizontal plane as the sliding-frame bottom-link  connection 136, allowing for the attachment of lower elevated implement  bottom-link connection points 314 and top-link connections 312 when  compared to the upright-design 40 of the connecting apparatus. The  compact-design 41 can be utilized on smaller tractors with lighter  weighted implements to be carried and used.   [0343] FIG. 18 is a perspective view showing the connecting apparatus of  FIG. 17 with a stand 165 attached to the outer vertical rigid frame  support members through holes 164 for removably supporting the connecting  apparatus 41 in a stored position. The stand 165 is designed for  attachment and use for both the upright-design 40 and the compact-design  41 of the connecting apparatus.

The stand 165 holds and supports the  rigidly-mounted frame section 45 along with the slidably-mounted frame  section 46 off of the ground for stable storage.   [0344] FIG. 19 is a close-up perspective view of the implement-facing side  of the sliding-frame bottom-link quick-hitch style connection point in a  bolt-on configuration to the adjustable mounting channel 122. Instead of  a sliding-frame bottom-link quick-hitch slip-on housing 135 (see FIG. 8),  a sliding-frame bottom-link quick-hitch bolt-on connector is used, the  connector comprising a housing 138 with latch and lever 139, mounted to  the adjustable mounting channel 122. The connector includes a hook and  stop bar 136. Channel mounting bolt and nut 128 attaches the  sliding-frame quick-hitch bolt-on housing 138 with the bolt passing  through both sides of the adjustable mounting channel 122 through holes  126 and through the sliding-frame quick-hitch bolt-on housing 138.  Adjustable mounting channel 122 is attached to triple wrap-around bracket  clamp 79 for added weight carrying capacity, utilizing six sliding-frame  horizontal frame brackets. Lower three sliding-frame horizontal frame  brackets support the sliding-frame bottom-links 138. Sliding-frame  bottom-link quick-hitch bolt-on housing 138 with hook and latch 139 is a  complete assembly, including a sliding-frame bottom-link quick-hitch hook  and stop bar 136 and sliding-frame bottom-link quick-hitch latch & lever  with grab shape 139. Indicia markings 190 are provided on two  sliding-frame horizontal frame members 59 and 60.   [0345] FIG. 19a shows attachment support bases 75 in place of triple wrap  around bracket clamps 79. Attachment support bases 75 are attached to the  sliding frame horizontal frame members in a manner such as welding them  in place with weld connections 73 shown on one section of the bracket to  be duplicated on the remaining sections of the bracket where the bracket  intersects the horizontal frame members of the sliding frame 46.  Attachment support bases 75 can replace the triple wrap around bracket  clamps 79 and also can replace double wrap around bracket clamps 78 (see  FIG. 10) and single wrap around bracket clamps 76 (see FIG. 16).  Currently many of the agricultural implement bottom link and top link  positions are being standardized to simplify quick hitch hookup  arrangements as built into many quick hitch adapters which mount on the  tractors three-point hitches. This standardization eliminates the need to  adjust the bottom link and top link positions on an apparatus such as the  connecting apparatus 40. In the above stated case of standardization,  attachment support bases 75 would be appropriate to mount to the  connecting apparatus and attached in a fixedly attachment such as metal  welding.   [0346] FIG. 20 is a close-up perspective view of the implement-facing side  of the sliding-frame bottom-link mounting arm and ball socket style 132  connection point in a bolt-on configuration to the adjustable mounting  channel 122. Sliding-frame bottom-link mounting arm and ball socket with  bolt-on housing 133 is mounted to the adjustable mounting channel 122.  Channel mounting bolt and nut 128 attaches sliding-frame bottom-link  mounting arm and ball socket with bolt-on housing 133 with the bolt  passing through both sides of the adjustable mounting channel 122 through  holes 126 and through the sliding-frame bottom-link mounting arm and ball  socket with bolt-on housing 133. Adjustable mounting channel 122 is  attached to double wrap-around bracket clamp 78. Indicia marks 190 are  shown on two sliding-frame horizontal frame members 59 and 60.   [0347] FIG. 21 shows a connector 131 that extends further towards the  implement than the connector 130. Connector 131 comprises a sliding frame  top-link hook and stop bar in a bolt-on configuration to the adjustable  mounting channel 122. The connector 131 has the top-link channel side  spacers 120 on each side.

Top-bar mounting legs 101 are shown with the top-bar mounting leg bolt  103 passing through the top-bar mounting leg pre-drilled hole 102 and  attaching to two of the sliding-frame vertical frame members.   [0348] FIG. 22 is a close-up perspective view of the upper-mounted top-bar  camera and lights carriage 104 attachment to the top-bar with single-wrap  around brackets 106, also showing top-bar inscribed indicia marks 190.   [0349] FIG. 23 is a close-up perspective view of the bar and distal ball  socket style 132 connection point of the lower connection points of a  three-point implement and a quick-hitch style connection device 135 as  described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,059,419, as it can slip over and secure to  the bar and distal ball socket style connection point 133. FIG. 23 shows  the sliding-frame mounting arm ball socket and rotatable ball with axial  hole 134 as the rotatable ball slips over quick-hitch slip-on housing 135  and connects via round pin and held in place with a cotter pin.  Sliding-frame bottom-link quick-hitch latch and lever with grab shape 139  combined with sliding-frame bottom-link quick-hitch hook and stop bar 136  receives a mounting stud 314 (see FIG. 2) from an implement bottom-link  connection. Sliding-frame bottom-link quick-hitch latch 139 rotates  downward and then back into the upward position after the implement  mounting stud 314 (see FIG. 2) is engaged in the sliding-frame  bottom-link quick-hitch hook and stop bar 136 for a secure holding  connection of the implement and the sliding-frame bottom-link quick-hitch  hook and stop bar 136. Sliding-frame bottom-link quick-hitch hook and  stop bar 136 allows for a stopping point when positioning the  bottom-links of the connecting apparatus sliding-frame 46 to the  implement bottom-links connection point or mounting stud 314. (see FIG.  2)   [0350] FIG. 24 is a perspective view of an Carry-All implement 300 with a  four-point hitch connection point configuration comprising two  bottom-link connection points 195 and two top-link connection points 192.  Although four-point connections of implements to agricultural or  excavating tractors are not commonly in use, using the connecting  apparatus to carry a four-point attached implement can have a positive  effect on the stability of the implement as the implement is attached and  carried by the sliding frame of the connecting apparatus. The connecting  apparatus being attached to the agricultural or excavation tractor in a  three-point attachment configuration preserves the three-point mounting  advantages of the four-point attached implement. The four-point implement  attachment to the connecting apparatus creates a secure attachment to the  connecting apparatus wherein the implement is a rigidly mounted extension  of the three point attached connecting apparatus.   [0351] FIG. 25 is a perspective view of FIG. 24 that comprises a fifth  connection point in the center of the top-link bar of the Carry-All  implement 300. This three top-link bracket setup allows for a four-point  or a three-point implement attachment to the connecting apparatus wherein  the implement top-link attachments for four-point or three-point design  194 is utilized as a convenient application for the user of the implement  as the implement in use is able to hookup to a three-point or four-point  connection. During a four-point implement connection hookup, the center  top-link bracket connection is not utilized. During a three-point  implement connection hookup, the two outer top-link bracket connections  are not utilized.

Shown are the roller cage double raceway  ninety degree V style with needle bearings 216 forming a ninety degree  configuration for sturdy slidable support between the sliding frame  member 206 and the rigid frame member 204. In this design with bearing  cages 216 installed, the clearance between the outside of the rigid-frame  horizontal frame member 204 and the inside of the hollow sliding-frame  horizontal frame member 206 is approximately 1/4 inch around each of the  four sides.   [0362] FIG. 36 is a close up side view of the sliding-frame horizontal  member sized for sliding plate or bearing clearance 206 slidably-attached  to and surrounding the rigid-frame horizontal member 204 with a roller  cage double raceway ninety degree V style with ball bearings 218 between  the sliding and rigid frames. Shown is the weld seam 210 on the  sliding-frame horizontal member sized for sliding plate or bearing  clearance 206 and the weld seam 208 on the rigid-frame horizontal member  204. Grease joints 74 are shown and inserted into a threaded hole in to  the sliding-frame horizontal member sized for sliding plate or bearing  clearance 206, bearing cap collar 220 fixedly attaches to sliding-frame  member 206 securing roller cage double raceway ninety degree V style with  ball bearings 218 in position. Shown are the roller cage double raceway  ninety degree V style with ball bearings 218 forming a ninety degree  configuration for sturdy slidable support between the sliding frame  member 206 and the rigid frame member 204. In this design with bearing  cages 216 installed, the clearance between the outside of the rigid-frame  horizontal frame member 204 and the inside of the hollow sliding-frame  horizontal frame member 206 is approximately 1/4 inch around each of the  four sides.   [0363] FIG. 37 and FIG. 37c show needle bearing cages 216 mounted to the  interior of sliding-frame horizontal frame sleeves 57,58,59,60 (see FIG.  5). The bottom 50% of the needle bearing cages 216 are normally installed  in the sliding-frame horizontal frame sleeves 57,58,59,60. The top and  the side tops of the sliding-frame horizontal frame sleeves 57,58,59,60  are shown without needle bearing cages 216 installed as to view the  bottom portion of the sliding-frame horizontal frame sleeves 57,58,59,60  as the needle bearing cages 216 are installed. A rigid-frame horizontal  frame rails 48,49,50,51 (see FIG. 5) slide inside of the bearing cages  216 as they are installed in the sliding-frame horizontal frame sleeves  57,58,59,60. The bearing cages 216 length can be measured and installed  half way in from each side of the end of the sliding-frame horizontal  frame member 57,58,59,60. The bearing cages 216 butt to each other in a  tight position in the center of the sliding frame member showing the  bearing cage edges 222, and also butt tightly against the bearing cap  collars 220 attached to each end of the sliding-frame horizontal frame  sleeves 57,58,59,60. Fitting the bearing cages 216 in each side of the  sliding-frame horizontal frame sleeves 57,58,59,60 and measuring, cutting  and installing the bearing cages 216 in half way across the sliding-frame  horizontal frame sleeves 57,58,59,60 allows the connecting apparatus  bearing cages 216 to be replaced without disassembling the rigid mounted  frame section 45 from the slidably-mounted frame section 46. The  slidably-mounted frame section 46 moves all the way to one side of the  rigid mounted frame section 45 to remove the bearing cages 216 from the  opposing side of the sliding-frame horizontal frame sleeves 57,58,59,60  consequently, installing the bearing cages 216 in the same manner.   [0364] FIG. 37a is a perspective view of sliding plates 214 mounted to the  interior of sliding-frame horizontal frame member 57,58,59,60 (see FIG.  5). All four sides of the sliding plates 214 are normally installed in  the sliding-frame horizontal frame member 57,58,59,60.   [0365] FIG. 37b is a perspective view of ball bearing cages and bearings  218 mounted to the interior of sliding-frame horizontal frame member  57,58,59,60 (see FIG. 5). All four sides of the ball bearing cages 218  are normally installed in the sliding-frame horizontal frame member  57,58,59,60.   [0366] FIG. 37c shows a bearing cap collar 220 that holds the needle  bearings cages 216 in place. The bearing cap collar 220 fits snug around  the rigid-frame horizontal frame member 48,49,50,51 (see FIG. 5). The  inside diameter of the bearing cap collar 220 is smaller in diameter than  the sliding-frame horizontal frame member 57,58,59,60 inside diameter to  prevent the needle bearings cages 216 from slipping out of the  sliding-frame horizontal frame member 57,58,59,60. The bearing cap collar  220 is fixedly attached to the sliding-frame horizontal frame member  57,58,59,60 and moves in harmony with said frame member. The thickness of  the bearing cap collar 220 is approximately the combined thickness of the  needle bearing cages 218 and the thickness of one of the sliding-frame  horizontal frame member 57,58,59,60. The bearing cap also can be used  with the versions of FIGS. 37a and 37b.   [0367] FIG. 38 is a perspective view of the tractor facing side of the  connecting apparatus 40 showing the rigidly-mounted frame 45 two  bottom-link attachments 69 in a single vertical plate and stud  configuration that would attach to the tractor bottom-link arms 318 (see  FIG. 1c).   [0368] FIG. 39a is a perspective view of a third connecting apparatus 42  comprising the sliding-frame horizontal frame members and rigid-frame  horizontal frame members in a square shape and installed in a square  position with horizontal and vertical as compared to a horizontal plane.  Top-link attachment 66 shown with brackets matching to the square  horizontal frame member 47 and bottom-link attachments 69 shown with  brackets matching to the square horizontal frame member 52.   [0369] FIG. 39b is a perspective view of a fourth connecting apparatus 43  comprising the sliding-frame horizontal frame members and rigid-frame  horizontal frame members in a round shape. Top-link attachment 66 shown  with brackets matching to the round horizontal frame member 47 and  bottom-link attachments 69 shown with brackets matching to the round  horizontal frame member 52.   [0370] FIG. 39c shows independently controlled wing sections 221 that  attach to the left and right side edges of the rigidly-mounted base frame  45 of the connecting apparatus 40. The wing sections 221 comprise their  own rigidly-mounted base frame 45 and their own slidably-mounted frame  46. All three slidably-mounted frames 46 move independently of each  other. The wing sections 221 can be utilized for carrying lighter duty  implements such as weeders, sprayers, cutters and the like. The wing  sections 221 attach to the three-point attached first connecting  apparatus 40 using a hinge. A piano style hinge 230 can be a suitable  preferred attachment device to utilize for the attachment and pivoting  action of the wing section 221 as connected to the three-point attached  first connecting apparatus 40 left and right side edges. Attachment  hardware 224 and 226 allows for a push pull means such as a hydraulic  cylinder 228 to be mounted on the first connecting apparatus 40 and on  each wing section 221 at the joining corners at the top and bottom of the  three rigidly mounted frame sections 45. Each wing section 221 pivoting  action can be controlled separately apart from the opposing wing section  allowing for individual control of the wing sections. Two hydraulic  cylinders 228 for each wing section 221 can work in tandem using a  hydraulic fluid flow divider 232 between the hydraulic cylinders 228 and  the tractor mounted hydraulic control valve 234. For control of the  slidably mounted frames 46 on each wing sections 221, the wing section  driver 80 can attach directly between the rigidly mounted first frame 45  and the slidably mounted frame 46 using the attachment bracket 89 to the  driver 80 piston arm and the attachment bracket 90 to the driver 80  cylinder housing. The mounted position of the driver 80 on the wing  section differs from the mounting position of the driver 80 on the first  connecting apparatus 40. This difference is the result of the offset  positioning of the wing section 221 slidably-mounted frame 46 as mounted  on the rigidly mounted first frame 45.   [0371] Shown are hydraulic fluid lines 84 from the hydraulic control valve  234 leading to a hydraulic power pump 81, and showing the hydraulic fluid  lines 86 from the hydraulic cylinder 228 to the hydraulic flow divider 88  and showing the hydraulic fluid lines 87 from the hydraulic flow divider  88 to the hydraulic control valve 234.   [0372] For hydraulic or electrically powered devices for driving the  second framework of each wing section 221, such as a hydraulic or  electrically powered cylinder, or for locally pumped fluid, a power  receptacle can be provided on the first framework 45 of the first  connecting apparatus 40, or alternatively on the mobile machinery. The  power receptacle can receive hydraulic fluid or electrical power such as  DC or AC power. For hydraulic or electrically powered devices for driving  the second framework of the first connecting apparatus 40, such as a  hydraulic or electrically powered cylinder, or for locally pumped fluid,  a power receptacle can be provided on the mobile machinery. The power  receptacle can receive power such as hydraulic fluid or DC or AC power.   [0373] Each wing section 221 slidably-mounted frame 46 is mounted in an  offset position on the wing section rigidly-mounted base frame 45 to  allow for the implements attached to the wing section 221 to extend past  the outer edge of the wing section 221, thereby allowing for the  implements attached to the first connecting apparatus 40 to extend  partially across and into the horizontal plane of the wing section 221.  This allows for a cultivating or other farm work path of approximately  sixty feet in width when utilizing three independently moving twenty feet  wide implements. The outer wing section 221 sliding frames 46 move  independently of each other and independently of the first connecting  apparatus 40 sliding frame 46. This independent motion of the sliding  frames allows for a farmer to till, bed-shape and plant crop sections of  the farmland in twenty-foot wide sections using the first connecting  apparatus 40 with attached implements and then mount the lighter weight  wing sections 221 to the first connecting apparatus 40 for the use of  lighter weight implements that can traverse two additional twenty-feet  wide crop sections for less strenuous implement activities such as  weeding, spraying and harvesting. The independent motion of the wing  section 221 sliding frames 46 allows the wing section 221 sliding frame  46 to follow their own particular section of the crop rows as that  particular section of crop rows was planted by a guidance system  independently of the other crop row sections in the sixty-foot total area  covered, variances between the twenty-foot sections of crops rows  throughout the farm occur. Conversely, if a sixty-foot continuous  implement is attached to the first connecting apparatus 40 sliding-frame  46 with no independently controlled wing sections attached and traversing  three twenty foot sections of crop rows and the twenty-foot sections of  crop rows as shaped and planted independently of each other as many  farmers practice currently, the sixty-foot continuous implement may not  align properly with all of the planted crop rows resulting in damaged  crops in a farming procedure such as weeding.   [0374] Functionality of the Related Parts of the Connecting Apparatus:   [0375] The receiver 110 or 110e provides the present position of the  slidable-frame 46 to a GPS controller or laser beam fixedly located in  the field. The GPS controller or laser beam contains the coordinates  describing the desired field position of the implement attached to the  slidable-frame 46 at any one time. If the slidable-frame 46 and the  implement being carried are out of position, the GPS signal or laser  beams signal, after being received by the receiver-110 or 110e, directs  the driver controller 150 to position the driver 80 to keep the implement  which is attached to the connecting apparatus on the prescribed path  using the hydraulic controls on the tractor the apparatus 40. The piston  of the hydraulic cylinder 80 moves the slidable-frame 46 laterally to the  desired position as the tractor moves along.   [0376] A GPS controller is typically a microprocessor that receives GPS  signals, compare the received signal to preprogrammed desired  coordinates, and outputs a signal based on the difference, if any,  between the desired coordinates and the received position. Such GPS  controllers are conventionally used for controlling tractor steering. A  conventional GPS guided steering system for tractors is available from  Trimble of Sunnyvale, Calif. One popular GPS guidance system currently  being used in the agricultural industry is called Real-Time Kinematic  (RTK). RTK systems when combined with earth mounted base stations using  radio or cellular signals relayed to the roving mobile machinery within a  prescribed radius location can achieve horizontal accuracy of <4  centimeters in most conditions. Laser guidance and wire signal guidance  are also viable guidance system technologies available for the control of  the present invention apparatuses. A laser guidance system normally uses  a vertical spinning laser transmitter to be received by the laser  receiver mounted on the apparatus top bar 100a or 100b. The laser  receiver 110 then transmits a signal to the controller 150 which then  controls the driver 80 and the position of the sliding frame 46 of the  controlled apparatus 40. A wire signal guidance system involves multiple  sensors mounted on a bottom bar for a buried wire and on the top bar for  overhead wires. The bottom bar 140 sensor mounted system normally is  utilized in open field agriculture while the top bar 100b mounted sensors  system normally is utilized in greenhouse agricultural applications.   [0377] The lateral position of the sliding frame with respect to the  center line of the base frame and forward movement of the tractor can be  adjusted by causing the pistons of the hydraulic cylinder 32 to extend or  retract.   [0378] The control of the hydraulic cylinder 80 can be implemented in  manual mode by the driver, a second individual, or automatically in  automatic mode by a controller including sensors monitoring the position  of the three-point hitch attached implement with respect to a known  desired position for the implement.   [0379] A system according to this invention comprises the mobile machinery  such as a tractor having a three-point hitch, the connecting apparatus  attached to the mobile machinery with the three attachments; and an  implement attached to the slidable second framework with at least three  connectors. To connect the apparatus to the implement, the implement and  apparatus are placed proximate to each other; the alignment of the  connectors and the hitches are determined, and the alignment is adjusted  by sliding the second framework relative to the first framework.   [0380] After attachment of the implement to the connecting apparatus is  completed, during use of the system, the position of the implement  relative to the mobile machinery is adjusted by the mobile machinery  operator in manual mode or by the signal receiver 110 or 110e and the  driver controller 150 in automatic mode, changing the position of the  second framework to keep the implement on track.   [0381] The driver 80 can be powered hydraulically or electrically. FIG. 4a  is a flow chart depicting a hydraulic driver and related components  suitable for use with the present invention. It utilizes mobile machinery  hydraulic pump 81, which is normally used for controlling the three-point  hitch link arms 318 and 324 (see FIG. 3) and utilizes a fluid reservoir.  A guidance signal is received by the receiver 110 or 110e which is  connected to the driver controller 150. The antenna (not shown) is  optionally provided to enhance the reception of the guidance signal to  the GPS receiver 110e, but not requires for a laser receiver 110. The  driver controller 150 transmits a signal to the automatic double action  hydraulic valve 238 to control the driver 80. If the hydraulic valve  option switch 240 is in the automatic position, the automatic double  action hydraulic valve 238 controls the driver 80. If the hydraulic valve  option switch 240 is in the manual position, the automatic double action  hydraulic valve 238 does not receive hydraulic fluid and is not  operational, and thus the manual double action hydraulic valve 236  controls the driver at the tractor operator's initiation. Hydraulic power  receptacles 242 provide connect and disconnect locations for the  hydraulic lines leading from the hydraulic fluid valves to the driver 80  for connection and removal of the apparatus from the three point hitch of  the mobile machinery.   [0382] Electrical power from the mobile machinery battery is used for  powering the drive controller 150 and signal receiver 110 or 110e.   [0383] FIG. 4b is a flow chart depicting an electric driver and related  components of the present invention apparatuses. As in the hydraulic  version, a guidance signal is received by the receiver 110 or 110e which  then transmits the signal to the driver controller 150. The driver  controller 150 sends a signal to an automatic electric switch 248 to  control the driver 80. If an electric option switch 250 is in the  automatic position, the automatic electric switch 248 controls the driver  80. If the electric option switch 250 is in the manual position, the  automatic electric switch 248 does not receive electric current and is  not operational, therefore allowing the manual electric switch 246 to  control the driver at the tractor operator's initiation. Electric power  receptacles 244 provide connect and disconnect locations for the  electrical conductors leading from the electric switches to the driver 80  for the connection and removal of the present invention apparatuses from  the three point hitch of the tractor.   [0384] A typical method of using the invention for agricultural comprises:   [0385] 1. Choose a guidance system: [0386] a. Manual or automatic.  [0387] b. If manual, choose single tractor operator or double tractor  operator. (Double operator--first operator steering the tractor and the  second operator manually controlling the apparatus driver 80). [0388] c.  If automatic, choose GPS guided, laser guided, guidance wire guided or  other. [0389] d. If automatic is chosen, the guidance system must be set  up and installed.   [0390] 2. Row and raised bed crops utilizing the guided system with all  steps for any or all of the following: [0391] a. Precision tilling or  preparing the soil for planting. [0392] b. Precision position spraying of  herbicides and/or insecticides prior to planting if required. [0393] c.  Precision laying or dropping fertilizer if required. [0394] d. Precision  position installing drip tape if required. [0395] e. Precision position  installing of mulch or plastic culture if required. [0396] f. Precision  position planting of seeds or transplanting seedlings. [0397] g.  Precision position spraying of herbicides and/or insecticides after  planting if required. [0398] h. Precision position weeding with soil  cultivation or weed cutting when required. [0399] i. Precision position  harvesting.   [0400] The invention can also be used for earth excavating and grading.   [0401] Among the advantages of the invention with a guided system are:  [0402] a) The horizontal adjustments of the present invention provide an  accurate system of obtaining the desired path of excavation and soil  preparation as compared to utilizing an automated steering device of the  mobile machinery as the only form of implement path guidance. [0403] b)  Utilizing mobile machinery steering guidance combined with mobile  machinery implement guidance creates a more accurate system of obtaining  the desired path of excavation and soil preparation as compared to  utilizing an automated steering device of the mobile machinery as the  only form of implement path guidance.   Example of Construction of Materials   [0404] The following are exemplary materials that can be used for the  claimed invention:   [0405] Rigid-frame horizontal frame members   [0406] ASTM A500 Grade B cold formed welded carbon steel structural square  tubing, or;   [0407] ASTM A500 Grade B cold formed welded carbon steel structural round  tubing, or;   [0408] Solid square steel bars, or;   [0409] Solid round steel bars   [0410] Rigid-frame vertical frame members   [0411] ASTM A500 Grade B cold formed welded carbon steel structural  rectangular tubing, or;   [0412] Solid steel plate   [0413] Sliding-frame horizontal frame members   [0414] ASTM A500 Grade B cold formed welded carbon steel structural square  tubing, or;   [0415] ASTM A500 Grade B cold formed welded carbon steel structural round  tubing, or;   [0416] Sliding-frame vertical frame members   [0417] ASTM A500 Grade B cold formed welded carbon steel structural  rectangular tubing, or;   [0418] Solid steel plate   [0419] The foregoing detailed description is given primarily for clearness  of understanding and no unnecessary limitations are to be understood  therefrom, for modification will become obvious to those skilled in the  art upon reading this disclosure and may be made without departing from  the spirit of the invention and scope of the appended claims. For  example, the invention has been principally described using a tractor as  the mobile machinery. However the invention can be used with other  machinery such as truck, plow, or excavating machinery. In addition,  although the invention has been described principally with regard to  hydraulic cylinders, electric cylinders can be used. Instead of a sleeve  for the second framework to slide along the rails, the rails can be  provided with a bracket, track, or other structure which can be engaged  by the second framework such as a projection on lateral cross members.  Accordingly, this invention is not intended to be limited by the specific  exemplification presented herein above. Rather, what is intended to be  covered is within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.   * * * * *",
