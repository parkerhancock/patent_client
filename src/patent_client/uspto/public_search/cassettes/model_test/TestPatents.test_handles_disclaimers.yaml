        The leakoff rate of a borate-crosslinked guar fracturing fluid was determined
        in the following manner: A fracturing fluid was prepared from synthetic seawater
        containing 30 lb/1000 gal of a polymer slurry, 1.0 gal/1000 gal surfactant,
        0.5 gal/1000 gal bactericide and 0.25 gal/1000 gal antifoaming agent. Approximately
        2000 ml of this fluid was crosslinked with a borate crosslinking agent, poured
        into a large barold cell and heated to 200 F. for 30 minutes. Using 1000 psi
        pressure, a fluid leakoff test was performed with a one inch sandstone core
        having a low permeability (0.5 millidarcy). Results are presented in Table
        A.<br />(3) EXAMPLES 2-5<br />(4) In a manner similar to example 1, the behavior
        of fiber/fracturing fluid mixtures were determined. All tests were performed
        identical to example 1 but included 2.0 g of glass fibers (1/2&quot; long
        and 16 microns in diameter) that were added to the fluid prior to crosslinking.
        Other modifications to example 1 were:<br />(5) EXAMPLE 2 contains 30 lb/1000
        gal of a polymer slurry.<br />(6) EXAMPLE 3 contains 25 lb/1000 gal of a polymer

        gal polymer slurry, 1.0 gal/1000 gal surfactant, 0.5 gal/1000 gal bactericide
        and 0.25 gal/1000 gal antifoaming agent. No crosslinker was added to the system.<br
        />(8) EXAMPLE 5 is identical to Example 3 but a sandstone core having a permeability
        of 100 millidarcy was used.<br />(9) The data are presented in Table A. These
        data demonstrate that the fibers dramatically decrease the leakoff rate under
        fracturing conditions.<br />(10)  TABLE A&zwnj;  ______________________________________&zwnj;  LEAKOFF

        fluid was measured. The fluid contained tap water and 80 lb/1000 gal. of hydroxyethylcellulose.
        The particulate was a sized calcium carbonate (1-500 microns) which was added
        at a concentration of 0.5 lbs/gallon of fluid. Approximately 250 mls of this
        fluid was blended and added to a large barold fluid loss cell preheated to
        175 F. After 15 minutes, 500 psi of nitrogen pressure was applied to force
        the fluid against a one inch sandstone core having a permeability of 250 millidarcy.
        Results are presented in Table B.<br />(13) EXAMPLES: 7-10<br />(14) The tests
        were repeated using glass fibers alone and in combination with the calcium
        carbonate particulate material. The particle loading remained constant at
        0.5 lbs/gallon of fluid. The fibers were added to the fluid at the time of
        the calcium carbonate addition. The fiber was added as a function of weight

        />(21) Example 10 (fibers alone) showed no migration into the core. Particulate
        systems (Example 6) always show some migration into the core.<br />(22) The
        data demonstrate superior leakoff control by the fibers. An additional advantage
        of fibers is no particulate migration into gravel pack or formation, therefore,
        less damage.<br />(23) The following examples illustrate the ability of fibrillated
        fibers to stabilize proppant packs:<br />(24) EXAMPLE 11: (CONTROL)<br />(25)
        200 grams 20/40 mesh sand in 105 ml aqueous guar solution was poured into
        a 25mm diameter glass column fitted with a bottom valve. Permeability of the
        pack was 380 darcies. The sand readily flowed through the 1/8 inch diameter
        valve when it was opened.<br />(26) EXAMPLE 12<br />(27) In a similar manner,
        the Example 11 was repeated but 2 g polyacrylonitrile fibrillated fiber was
        mixed with the same slurry before it was poured into the column. The pack
        permeability was 120 darcies. The pack did not flow out when the valve was
        opened. It was also stable when the valve was completely removed leaving a
        1/4 inch diameter hole directly under the sand pack.<br />(28) This illustrates
        the ability of fibrillated fibers to consolidate a sand pack.<br />(29) EXAMPLE
        13<br />(30) Fibers Stabilize Sand Pack: A 30 lb/1000 gallon uncrosslinked
        guar solution was made. The composition of this fluid was the same as in Example
        1. Fifty ml of this fluid were mixed with 0.8 grams of 12 mm long, 16 micron
        diameter glass fibers. They were mixed with a Hamilton Beach stirrer at low
        speed for 15  seconds. 100 grams of 20/40 proppant sand were added to the
        mixture and mixed by hand in a closed 4 oz. jar by gentle shaking. The resulting
        mixture was poured into a vertical glass column 12 mm in diameter with a &quot;T&quot;
        section at the bottom. The left end of the &quot;T&quot; had a screen installed
        and the right end did not. First, water was flowed down the column and out
        the left side of the &quot;T&quot; to clean the guar from the sand/fiber and
        make a pack. The permeability of the pack was then measured. It was 278 darcies.<br
        />(31) Next, the water flowed left to right across the &quot;T&quot;. This
        washed the sand and fiber from the &quot;T&quot; section. The sand/fiber pack
        in the column section remained stable.<br />(32) The water direction was then
        changed to flow down the column and out the right side of the &quot;T&quot;.
        This created a pressure drop across the sand/fiber pack, and no screen prevented
        the sand from moving with the flow. The pressure drop was increased (by increasing
        the flow rate) until the sand/fiber pack failed and flowed out of the vertical
        section of the column. The pressure drop across the sand/fiber pack required
        to do this was in excess of 275 kPa (40 psi). Almost none of the sand in the
        sand/fiber pack flowed out of the vertical section of the column until the
        sand pack &quot;failed.&quot;<br />(33) EXAMPLE 14<br />(34) A 30 lb/1000
        uncrosslinked guar solution was mixed with the proppant sand (50 ml solution
        with 100 grams sand) following the same procedure as in Example 13 but WITHOUT
        the fiber. This mixture was put into the column and the guar was cleaned out
        of the sand pack in the same manner as in Example 13. The permeability of
        the sand pack was 250 darcies. The sand pack failed under an unmeasurably
        low pressure.<br />(35) These examples (13 and 14) illustrate that mixing
        fibers with the proppant sand caused the formation of a stable pack in the
        column. The fibers held the sand in place against a much higher force (pressure)
        than the sand without fibers. Also, the fibers had a negligible effect on
        the permeability of the sand pack.<br />(36) EXAMPLE 15<br />(37) Nylon Fibers:
        Fifty ml of a 30 lb/1000 gallon guar solution were mixed with 0.2 grams of
        20 mm long, 64 micron diameter, nylon polyamide fibers. The mixing was done
        in a similar manner to that of Example 13. This mixture was poured into the
        column and tested as described in Example 13. The permeability of the sand/fiber
        pack was 200 darcies. The sand/fiber pack failed at a drawdownpressure across
        the pack of 265 kPa.<br />(38) EXAMPLE 16<br />(39) Sand Pack Stabilization
        With High Viscosity Fluids: 1 gram of 32 mm long, 16 micron diameter glass
        fiber was mixed with a solution of corn syrup and water having a viscosity
        of 600 centipoise. The mixing was done in a Hamilton Beach stirrer at low
        speed for 10 seconds. 100 grams of 20/40 proppant sand was then mixed with
        the fiber and solution. The mixture was poured into the column described in
        Example 13. In this case, the 600 centipoise corn syrup solution was flowed
        through the column. The sand/fiber pack permeability was 352 darcies. The
        pressure drop across the sand/fiber pack was increased with the flow direction
        out of the right side of the &quot;T&quot; (no screen). The pressure drop
        across the sand pack was raised to 400 kPa without pack failure.<br />(40)
        This example illustrates that the fibers cause the sand pack to be stable
        even with high viscosity fluids flowing through them. High viscosity fluids
        flowing through the sand would occur if a guar gel was flowed back through
        the fracture during clean-up.<br />(41) EXAMPLE 17<br />(42) Settling: A 30
        lb/1000 gallon guar/borate crosslinked gel was made. The composition was that
        of the guar solution in Example 13. 12 mm, 16 micron diameter glass fibers
        (0.8 weight % of sand) and 20/40 proppant sand were added to a quantity of
        the gel such that the sand concentration was 10 lb/gallon of gel. The sand
        and fiber were added to the guar solution prior the gel crosslinker solution.
        The fiber was added to the solution, and dispersed with a Hamilton Beach mixer.
        This was added to the sand in a closed jar and gently mixed by shaking. The
        composition of the crosslinker solution was 0.3 grams boric acid, 0.6 grams
        sodium hydroxide, 1.2 grams sodium gluconate, 0.5 ml triethanol amine, and
        0.6 grams sodium thiosulfate for 500 ml of guar solution. The resulting mixture
        was placed in a heated closed column and further mixed by inverting the column
        once per minute. The mixture was heating to 66 degrees Celsius and the column
        was oriented in the vertical. The mixture ran to the bottom of the column.
        The settling of the sand and fiber in the guar gel were observed as a function
        of time at 66 degrees Celsius. Percent settling was calculated as follows:<br
        />(43) % settling=100.times.(total height-sand height)/maximum liquid height.<br
        />(44) Total height is the height of sand plus gel liquid. Sand height is
        the height of the top of the sand layer. Maximum liquid height is determined
        with sand and water in the same amounts.<br />(45) After 315 minutes the settling
        for the sand and fiber was 17%. There was no tendency of the sand and fibers
        to phase separate during the settling.<br />(46) EXAMPLE 18<br />(47) The
        experiment of Example 17 was repeated with 1.3% of the glass fiber based on
        the sand weight. In this case, after 260 minutes the settling was 14%.<br
        />(48) EXAMPLE 19<br />(49) The sand alone in the fluid of Example 17 settled
        60% in 300 minutes. By comparison with Examples 17 and 18, this example shows
        that the glass fibers reduce the settling rate of the sand in the gel.<br
        />(50) EXAMPLE 20<br />(51) Interaction with Borate Gel: Six liters of a 30
        lb/1000 gallon uncrosslinked guar solution were mixed with 47.6 gram of 12
        mm long, 16 micron diameter glass fibers. The fiber level was based on 8 lb/gallon
        sand loading. No sand was added to the fiber/solution mixture. The fiber/solution
        mixture was allowed to sit approximately one half hour after mixing. Two fifty
        ml samples were removed. The fibers were filtered from one of the fifty ml
        samples. The Fann35 viscosity of each sample was measured at 70 degrees F.
        The sample with fibers had viscosities of 51 and 30 cp. at 170 and 510 sec.sup.-1
        rate respectively. The filtered sample had viscosities of 42 and 24 cp respectively.
        The viscosities of the filtered sample were well within specifications for
        this guar solution. The solution with fibers had a slightly higher viscosity.<br
        />(52) Next borate crosslinker solution (composition in Example 17) was added
        to both solutions. The time to gelling was measured for both by &quot;hang
        lip&quot; methods. The filtered solution had a &quot;hang lip&quot; time of
        4 minutes, 44 seconds. The sample with fiber had a &quot;hang lip&quot; time
        of 4 minutes 27 seconds. Both these crosslinking times are within specifications
        for these guar gels.<br />(53) This example illustrates that the preferred
        glass fibers do not affect the viscosity and the &quot;hang lip&quot; gel
        times of the borate crosslinked guar gel. This illustrates that the glass
        fibers do not affect the guar gel chemistry or viscosity significantly.<br
        />(54) EXAMPLE 21<br />(55) Interaction With Zirconate Gel: The same mixing
        procedure as in Example 20 was followed with a 50 lb/1000 gallon hydroxypropyl
        guar solution. The 12 mm glass fibers were added to, then filtered out of
        one aliquot of the solution. This aliquot and another aliquot that had not
        been exposed to the fibers were crosslinked with a 4.5 lb/1000 gallon zirconium-solution.
        The solution was 40% zirconium crosslinker, 24% high temperature stabilizer,
        and 36% water. Crosslinking hang lip times were 9:19 minutes for the sample
        not exposed to the fibers, and 10:13 minutes for the sample exposed to the
        fibers. Again, the fibers do not affect the crosslinked gel chemistry.<br
        />(56) EXAMPLE22<br />(57) Conductivity. Conductivity testing was done with
        20/40 mesh proppant. The fluid was a 30 lb/1000 gallon uncrosslinked guar
        solution. The composition was 17 ml of 2% KCl water, 0.12 ml guar slurry,
        0.02 ml fluorocarbon surfactant, and 0.005ml defoamer. The fluid was mixed
        with 63 grams of 20/40 proppant. The test was done in a conductivity cell
        at 250 F. and 5000 psi closure stress. The conductivity after 23 hours of
        flowback was 157 darcies.<br />(58) The test was repeated with the same quantities
        of fluid and proppant. In addition, 0.5 grams (0.8%) of 12 mm long, 16 micron
        diameter glass fibers were mixed with the proppant and fluid. The conductivity
        after 24 hours of flowback was 153 darcies.<br />(59) This example illustrates
        that the fibers have a negligible effect on proppant pack permeability.<br
        />(60) EXAMPLE 23<br />(61) Slot Flow. The fiber/sand pack stability was tested
        in a slot geometry. 5 liters of 30 lb/1000 gallon uncrosslinked guar solution
        were made (34 ml guar slurry, 5 ml surfactant, and 1.25 ml defoamer and 5000
        ml of tap water). This was mixed by recirculating the fluid through a holding
        tank and centrifuge pump for 15 minutes. 5000 grams of 20/40 sand was then
        added and allowed to disperse for approximately 1 minute. 50 grams of 12 mm
        long, 16 micron diameter glass fiber were added to the mixture. The resulting
        slurry was pumped into the slot.<br />(62) The slot is approximately 5-1/2
        feet long, 1/4&quot; wide and 6&quot; high. The surfaces are smooth, with
        the front surface being clear to allow observation. A screen was placed over
        the exit port so that the sand could not flow out of the slot. The slurry
        was pumped into the slot from the other end. In this geometry, a pack of sand
        and fibers built up against the screen, while the fluid was allowed to flow
        through the screen to a holding tank. A 6&quot; long sand/fiber pack was built
        up against the screen.<br />(63) The guar fluid was then washed from the pack
        with water. The screen was removed from the end of the slot, leaving the pack
        with an open 1/4&quot;.times.6&quot; face. Water was flowed through the pack
        to test its strength. The water flow was increased until a 6 psi pressure
        drop was supported by the pack. At this point the pack began to fail and sand
        flowed out of the slot.<br />(64) EXAMPLE 24<br />(65) Slot Flow, Rough walls,
        Glass fibers: The same slurry as in Example 23 was again tested in the slot
        geometry. In this example, the walls of the slot were roughened. This was
        done by adhering a layer of 20/40 sand to the walls of the slot with rubber
        cement. In this geometry, a 22&quot; sand/fiber pack was obtained and the
        strength of the pack exceeded 15 psi drawdown (upper limit on pump).<br />(66)
        EXAMPLE 25<br />(67) Slot With Gas Flow: A similar slurry as used in Example
        23 was used in this example. In this example we used a 10 lb/1000 gallon guar
        solution. This slurry was pumped into the slot with rough walls and the screen
        as described in Example 24. The guar solution was washed from the sand/fiber
        pack with water. Then the pack was dried with air flowing through it for 3-1/2
        hours. The screen was removed and the test for pack strength was performed.
        The pack length was 18&quot;. The air flow rate was increased to 13 psi drawdownacross
        the pack. The pack did not fail.<br />(68) The pack was then further dried
        at low air flow rate for an additional two hours. The test was repeated. The
        sand/fiber pack did not fail with flow up to an 11 psi drawdown across the
        pack.<br />(69) This example illustrates that the sand/fiber pack is resistant
        to gas flows as well as water flows.<br />(70) EXAMPLE 26<br />(71) Slot Flow
        With 1/2&quot; aramide fibers: &quot;KEVLAR.TM.&quot; polyaramide fibers were
        tested in the slot geometry with rough walls. The fluid was a 20 lb/1000 gallon
        uncrosslinkedguar solution similar to Example 23. The aramide fibers were
        12 mm long and 12 microns in diameter. The slurry mixture was 4 liters of
        fluid, 4 kg of 20/40 proppant sand, and 12 grams of&quot;KEVLAR&quot; fiber
        (0.3 wt. % of sand).<br />(72) The sand/fiber slurry was pumped into the rough
        walled slot with the screen at one end as was described in Examples 23 and
        24. The resulting sand pack was 14.5&quot; long. The fluid was washed from
        the sand fiber pack with water. The screen was removed and the water was again
        flowed through the pack. The pack began to fail at 3 psi drawdown.<br />(73)
        EXAMPLE 27<br />(74) Slot Flow, 1&quot; Nylon Fibers: We tested 1&quot; long
        nylon fibers in the rough walled slot. The fibers were 64 microns in diameter.
        The slurry was 5 liters of 30 lb/1000 gallon uncrosslinked guar solution,
        5 Kg of 20/40 proppant sand, and 15 grams of nylon fiber. The sand/fiber pack
        length was 6&quot;. The pack began to fail at less than 1 psi drawdown.<br
        />(75) Examples 23-27 illustrate that fibers stabilize a proppant pack in
        a fracturing geometry even with smooth walls and no closure stress.<br />(76)
        EXAMPLE 28<br />(77) Slot Flow: The fiber sand pack strength was tested. A
        30 lb/1000 gallon uncrosslinked guar solution with the same composition as
        Example 23 except that 2% KCl water was used. 20/40 proppant was added to
        the fluid at 12 pounds per gallon. 12 mm long, 16 micron diameter glass fibers
        were also added at 1% of the proppant level.<br />(78) The slurry was loaded
        into a 5-1/4&quot; by 5-1/4&quot; by 1/4&quot; slot. The walls of the slot
        were lined with Springwall sandstone. A closure stress of 250 psi was applied.
        The cell was heated to 210 F. The fluid was washed from the gel with a 1%
        KCl solution flowing at a slow rate (50 ml/min). The brine was then washed
        from the cell with a saturated nitrogen gas flow. The cell was then heated
        to 22F. The test was no performed with the nitrogen flow at increasing drawdown
        across the pack. The pack was stable at 20 psi/ft. with a closure stress ranging
        from 100 to 200 psi.<br />(79) EXAMPLE 29<br />(80) Slot Flow, NO FIBERS:
        The same experiment as in Example 28 was performed with proppant without fibers.
        At 250 psi closure stress, 1/4&quot; slot, 225 F., the proppant pack failed
        at less than 0.2 psi/ft.<br />(81) These examples demonstrate the ability
        of fibers to stabilize a proppant pack under representative downhole conditions.<br
        />(82) EXAMPLE 30<br />(83) Yard Test: The glass fibers were tested in a yard
        test. The 12 mm long, 16 micron diameter glass fibers were added at a 1% level
        to the sand in a simulated fracture Job. The fibers were added by hand into
        a fracturing fluid blender with the 20/40 proppant. This mixture was combined
        with the 30 lb/1000 gallon crosslinked fracturing fluid in the blender. It
        then flowed through a triplex pump, a tree saver, a variable choke with 1000
        psi drawdown, and 300 yards of 3 inch pipe.<br />(84) The pumping schedule
        was:<br />(85) 1 ppg proppant at 6 bbls/min.<br />(86) 1.5 ppg proppant at
        6 bbls/min.<br />(87) 2 ppg proppant at 6 bbls/min.<br />(88) 3 ppg proppant
        at 8 bbls/min.<br />(89) 4 ppg proppant at 8 bbls/min.<br />(90) Samples of
        the mixture were taken at the exit of the pipe. The glass fibers were well
        mixed with the proppant and fluid, although some fiber breakage was apparent.<br
        />(91) The example demonstrates that fiber/sand slurries can be pumped with
        conventional pumping equipment and that the fibers are stable enough to survive
        this treatment.<br />(92) EXAMPLE 31<br />(93) Perforation Packing: The ability
        of fibers to keep sand in a reservoir over a 1/4&quot; perforation was tested.
        A model perforation 1/4&quot; in diameter and 3&quot; long with a 75 cubic
        inch reservoir at the outlet was used for the tests. The reservoir was equipped
        with a 20 mesh screen at the other side from the perforation. Slurry could
        then flow into the reservoir through the perforation and out through the screen.
        4.5 L of a 20  lbm/1000 gal/hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) solution was prepared
        (135 g NH.sub.4 Cl (3 wt %), 28.3 mL HEC solution and dry caustic to raise
        the pH to 8). This was mixed by recirculating the fluid through a holding
        tank and a centrifuge pump. The fluid was hydrated for ca. 30 min. 13.5 g
        Aramide staple, 1/2&quot; long, was mixed in and 2,696.5 g 20/40 sand were
        added to the mixture (5 lbm/gal proppant, 0.5 wt % fiber based on the proppant).
        The resulting slurry was pumped into the reservoir through the 1/4&quot; perforation.
        A pack of sand and fibers built up against the screen, while the fluid was
        allowed to flow through the screen into the holding tank.<br />(94) After
        packing the performation, the lines, the holding tank and the pump were cleaned
        and filled with water. The flow direction was reversed and water was pumped
        from the screen side through the packed perforation. No proppant was produced
        through the 1/4&quot; hole even by increasing the flow rate till a pressure
        drop across the pack of 15 psi was reached and kept for several minutes. The
        water flow was turned off and on several times. That did not produce sand
        either.<br />(95) EXAMPLE 32<br />(96) The same perforation was packed with
        20/40 sand and 12 mm long, 16 micron diameter glass fiber using a 30 lbm/1000
        gallon uncrosslinked guar solution. 4.5 L fluid were prepared (90 g KCl (2
        wt %), 4.5 mL surfactant, 1.125 mL defoamer, 30.6 mL guar slurry) and hydrated
        for 30 min. 27 g glass fiber were added and after one minute 2,700 g 20/40
        proppant (5 lbm/gal, 1 wt % fiber based on proppant). The packing and water
        flow were done as in Example 31.<br />(97) The packed perforation was kept
        for 10 days. Within this time water was flown through it ca. 5 times, each
        time turning the pump on and off several times. The pack was stable and produced
        one teaspoon proppant at the most.<br />(98) EXAMPLE 33<br />(99) The same
        setup as in Example 31 except for a 1/2&quot; perforation. This time polypropylene
        fibers ( 1/2&quot; long, 4 denier) and 30 lbm/1000 gal HEC were used.<br />(100)
        Fluid: 4.5 L. 135 g NH.sub.4 Cl, 42.5 mL HEC solution, caustic to raise the
        pH to 8.<br />(101) Proppant: 2,696.5 g 20/40 sand (5 lbm/gal)<br />(102)
        Fiber: 27 g polypropylene, 1/2&quot; long, 4 denlet (1 wt % based on proppant)<br
        />(103) Packing and flowing water through worked well, no sand production
        even over 1/2&quot; hole.<br />(104) Examples 31 through 33 illustrate that
        different types of fibers may be used to hold sand in place in the formation
        beyond the perforation tunnels. This is applicable to gravel packing, where
        gravel is placed outside of the perforations to stabilize subterranean formation
        sands.<br />(105) EXAMPLE 34<br />(106) Stabilization of Different Types of
        Proppant: Column experiments were performed using the fluid composition (30
        lb/1000 gallon guar solution), and procedure as in Example 13. 50 ml aliquots
        of fluid were mixed with 100 grams each of various proppants and 1 gram (or
        1.6 grams) each of 12 mm long, 16b micron diameter glass fibers. The proppants
        were 20/40 &quot;CARBOLITE.TM.&quot;, 20/40 &quot;ACFRAC SB ULTRA.TM.&quot;
        curable resin coated sand, and 20/40 &quot;ISOPAC.TM.&quot; light weight gravel.
        The &quot;CARBOLITE&quot; proppant has approximately the same density as sand,
        but is more spherical. The &quot;SB ULTRA&quot; has approximately the same
        density and sphericity as sand, but has a polymer coating. The &quot;ISOPAC&quot;  lightweight
        gravel is much less dense than sand, is more spherical, and has a polymer
        coating.<br />(107) The results of the column tests are shown in Table C.<br

        />(109) Examples 13 and 34 illustrate that the coating and sphericity of the
        proppant do not affect the ability of the fiber to strengthen the pack. Low
        density proppants (&quot;ISOPAC&quot;) may require greater amounts of fiber
        for pack strength.<br />(110) EXAMPLE 35<br />(111) The procedure of Example
        31 was repeated except that the pack was made in such a way that the half
        of the perforation model closest to the perforation 20 hole was filled with
        an identical sand/fiber mixture while the back half of the perforation was
        filed with sand. The pack was tested in the same way. No sand was produced.<br
        />(112) This example demonstrates that the proppant/fiber slurry may be used
        as a tail-in or pumped in stages between slugs of proppant slurry.<br />(113)
        EXAMPLE 36<br />(114) Proppant/fiber pack strength tests were performed in
        a rectangular cell with inside dimensions of 12.7 cm long, 3.8 cm wide, and
        2.5 cm thick. The cell was open at both ends. A perforation type geometry
        was set up in the cell by creating a restriction 0.63 cm on all inside dimensions.
        The cell was set up with a screen at the outlet. A slurry containing 500 ml
        of 30 lb/100 gallon guar solution in water (composition in Example 1), 500
        grams or 20/40 sand, and water (composition in Example 1), 500 grams of 20/40
        sand, and 1.25 grams of 7 micron by 0.63 cm carbon fiber was pumped into the
        cell and formed a pack against the exit screen. The guar was washed from the
        pack and then the screen was removed from the exit port. A closure stress
        of 500 psi was applied to the face of the pack. Water was flowed from the
        inlet to outlet through the length of the pack. The proppant and carbon fiber
        pack resisted the flow of water up to 35 kPa (about 5 psi) before the pack
        filed and flowed through the restriction.<br />(115) EXAMPLE 37<br />(116)
        The same test as above was performed by 5 grams of AR grade glass fibers (20
        micron diameter, 1.27 cm long) were added to the sand and carbon fiber slurry.
        The resulting pack held a drawdown of 135 kPa (about 18 psi) without failing.<br
        />(117) EXAMPLE 38<br />(118) The same test as above was performed with a
        slurry of 500 ml 30 lb/1000 gallon guar solution, 500 grams 20/40 sand, and
        5 grams AR grade glass fibers (20 micron diameter, 1.27 cm long). The pack
        failed at a drawdown of 36 kPa (5 psi).<br />(119) EXAMPLE 39<br />(120) The
        same test as above was performed with a slurry of 500 ml 30 lb/1000 gallon
        guar solution, and 50 grams 20/40 sand without fiber added. The pack failed
        immediately with the onset of water flow, and no measurable pressure drop
        was maintained across the pack.<br />(121) EXAMPLES 36-39 show that carbon
        fibers can be used to stabilize the pack and that mixtures of fiber can result
        in stronger packs than a single fiber type.<br />(122) EXAMPLE 40<br />(123)
        Proppant fiber pack strength tests were performed in a disk shaped cell. The
        diameter of the disk is 15.2 cm, and the thickness is 1.2.+-.0.05 cm. the
        cell has inlet and output openings 10.2 cm across. A screen was placed across
        the outlet. A slurry containing 1000 ml of 50 lb/1000 gallon guar solution,
        1000 grams of proppant, 15 grams of AR glass fibers (20 micron diameter, 12.7
        mm long) was pumped into the cell and formed a pack against the screen. In
        each test the proppant size was varied. The guar was washed from the pack,
        and then the screen was removed. Closure stress of 1000 psi was applied to
        the faces of the disk. The excess pack was cleaned from the cell, so that
        the pack was perpendicular to the flow direction from inlet and outlet. This
        resulted in a pack length from inlet to outlet of 11.4 cm. Water was then
        flowed through the pack until it failed and proppant flowed out of the cell.
        This coincided with a relaxation of the closure stress.<br />(124) ______________________________________&zwnj;  PROPPANT

        />(125) The same procedure was followed as in example 40 except that no fiber
        was added to the 20/40 sand pack. The pack failed at the onset of water follow
        and no pressure drawdown was maintained.<br />(126) The results show that
        the fibers will strengthen different proppant sizes.<br />(127) EXAMPLE 41<br
        />(128) 500 ml of a 50 pound per 1000 gallon borate crosslinked guar gel were
        prepared. The gel contained 3 grams guar, 10 grams potassium chloride 0.5
        mL surfactant, 0.25 mL bactericide, 0.125 mL antifoam agent, 0.5 mL stabilizer
        (iron control), 0.6 grams oxygen scavenger, 0.6 grams boric acid, 1.5 grams
        sodium hydroxide, and 3 grams sodium gluconate. 500 grams of 20/40 US mesh
        brady sand and 7.5 grams AR grade glass fiber (20 microns diameter, 12.7 mm
        length) were mixed into the gel.<br />(129) The resulting slurry was poured
        into a metal tube 22.1 mm inside diameter, and 127 mm in length. The ends
        of the tube were capped, and it was then heated to 150.degree. C. for 24 hours.
        These conditions were sufficient to &quot;break&quot; the gel. The tube was
        cooled, opened and a washer with 12.7 mm hole was fitted into one end of the
        tube. The tube was connected to a water source such that the washer was at
        the outlet end of the tube. Effectively the slurry mixture was held from sliding
        out of the tube by the washer, but water could flow through the slurry sand
        pack.<br />(130) The water flow was initiated at a low flow rate to wash the
        broken gel from the sand pack. No sand flowed out the tube with the water.
        The water flow rate was then increased. No sand flowed until the flow rate
        reached 7.6 L/min. which corresponded to 381 kPa drawdown across the pack.
        At this point the sand pack failed and ran out of the tubing through the washer.<br
        />(131) EXAMPLE 42<br />(132) The same experiment as above was run with the
        crosslinked gel and sand, but without the AR glass fibers. The sand pack flowed
        out of the tube through the washer at very low flow rate during the cleaning
        of the broken gel from the pack.<br />(133) While the invention has been described
        in the more limited aspects of preferred embodiments hereof, including numerous
        examples, other embodiments have been suggested and still others will occur
        to those skilled in the art upon a reading and understanding of the foregoing

        the art of recovery of hydrocarbon values from subterranean formations, and
        more particularly, to a method and means for controlling the transport of
        particulate solids in conjunction with the flow of hydrocarbon fluid from
        the formation into a wellbore.<br />(2) BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br />(3)
        Transport of particulate solids during the production of fluids from a wellbore
        has long presented a problem in the recovery of fluid mineral values from
        subterranean formations. Such transported particulate solids cannot only clog
        the wellbore thereby limiting or completely stopping fluid production, they
        represent a significant wear factor in well production equipment including
        pumps and seals used in the recovery process. Finally, these particulate solids
        must be separated from the valuable fluids adding further expense to the processing
        of these fluids for use.<br />(4) Particulates which are available for transport
        in fluids flowing to the wellbore may be present due to an unconsolidated
        nature of the subterranean formation and/or as a result of various well treatments
        placing particulate solids into the formation or the near wellbore area such
        as by fracturing and gravel packing.<br />(5) Several means have been attempted
        in order to limit or eliminate flowback of particulate proppant materials
        placed into the formation in a fracturing process. One means showing reasonable
        effectiveness has been to gradually release fracturing pressure once the fracturing
        operation has been completed so that fracture closure pressure acting against
        the proppant builds gradually allowing proppant matrix to stabilize before
        fracturing fluid flowback and well production can carry significant quantities
        of the proppant out of the fractures and back to the wellbore. It has also
        been common to use so-called &quot;resin-coated proppant&quot;, that is, particulate
        proppant materials having an adherent coating bonded to its outer surface
        so that the proppant particles are bonded to each other, a process which further
        reduces the possibility of proppant flowback. Since fracturing treatments
        may employ thousands or even millions of pounds of proppant, the use of expensive,
        resin-coated proppants is generally limited to use in the final stages of
        a fracturing treatment for economic purposes.<br />(6) In unconsolidated formations,
        it is common to place a filtration bed of gravel in the near-wellbore area
        in order to present a physical barrier to the transport of unconsolidated
        formation fines with the production of wellbore fluids. Typically, such so-called
        &quot;gravel packing operations&quot; involve the pumping and placement of
        a quantity of gravel and/or sand having a mesh size between 10 and 60 U.S.
        Standard Sieve Series mesh into the unconsolidated formation adjacent to the
        wellbore. It is sometimes also desirable to bind the gravel particles together
        in order to form a porous matrix through which formation fluids can pass while
        straining out and retaining the bulk of the unconsolidated sand and/or fines
        transported to the near wellbore area by the formation fluids. The gravel
        particles may constitute a resin-coated gravel which is either precured or
        can be cured by an overflush of a chemical binding agent once the gravel is
        in place. It has also been known to add various binding agents directly to
        an overflush of uncoated gravel particles in order to bind them together to
        form the porous matrix.<br />(7) It has been known in the past to utilize
        fibrous materials in well treatment fluids in order to prevent or limit fluid
        loss into a porous formation or vugular zone. In this regard, glass, asbestos,
        cotton or cellulosic fibers have been pumped in a slurry into a wellbore or
        formation in order to create a mat of fibrous material over areas of high
        fluid loss. As the mat builds, flow of well treatment fluids into these high
        fluid loss areas is inhibited or prevented. Such fluid loss agents are typically
        pumped in conjunction with drilling fluids or in nonproppant-carrying pad
        solutions preceding a proppant-laden fracturing fluid. The primary intent
        of using such fibrous materials in these fluids is for arresting or inhibiting
        fluid flow of fluids in certain desired areas of the wellbore or formation.<br
        />(8) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br />(9) The present invention provides a method
        and fluid for treating a subterranean formation and a resultant porous solid
        pack which inhibits the flow of both deposited and natural formation particulates
        and fines back through the wellbore with the production of formation fluids.<br
        />(10) In accordance with the invention, a method of treating a subterranean
        formation penetrated by a wellbore comprises the steps of providing a fluid
        suspension including a simultaneous mixture of particulate material and a
        fibrous material, pumping the fluid suspension including the mixture of the
        particulate material and fibrous material through the wellbore and depositing
        the particulate and fibrous material mixture in the subterranean formation.<br
        />(11) Further in accordance with the invention, the above-described method
        comprises providing a particulate material having a size in the range of 10
        to 100 mesh and a fibrous material selected from a group consisting of natural
        and synthetic organic fibers, glass fibers, ceramic fibers, carbon fibers,
        inorganic fibers and metal fibers and mixtures of these fibers.<br />(12)
        Still further in accordance with the invention, a well treatment fluid comprises
        a fluid suspension including a simultaneous mixture of a particulate material
        and a fibrous material.<br />(13) Still further in accordance with the invention,
        a means for inhibiting particulate transport in subterranean wells comprises
        a porous pack including a particulate material having a size ranging from
        about 10 to about 100 U.S. mesh in intimate mixture with a fibrous material.<br
        />(14) It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a means and
        method whereby flowback of particulate materials either pumped into a wellbore
        with a well treatment fluid or present as a result of unconsolidated formation
        fines is prevented or inhibited by the presence of fibers in an intimate mixture
        with a particulate material.<br />(15) It is yet another object of this invention
        to provide a means to control the flowback of particulate material in subterranean
        fluid production without the use of complicated and expensive resin formulations
        and procedures utilizing such resins to form a porous, consolidated bed of
        particulate.<br />(16) DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br
        />(17) These and other objects of the invention are accomplished through the
        manner and form of the present invention to be described hereinafter in conjunction
        with various examples of preferred embodiments illustrating the present invention.
        It will be understood that the examples presented are solely for the purpose
        of illustration and should not in any way be construed as a limitation of
        the overall concept of the invention.<br />(18) In the treatment of subterranean
        formations, it is common to place particulate materials as a filter medium
        and/or a proppant in the near wellbore area and/or in fractures extending
        outwardly from the wellbore. In fracturing operations, proppant is carried
        into fractures created when hydraulic pressure is applied to these subterranean
        rock formations to a point where fractures are developed. Proppant suspended
        in a viscosified fracturing fluid is then carried outwardly away way from
        the wellbore within the fractures as they are created and extended with continued
        pumping. Ideally, upon release of pumping pressure, the proppant materials
        remain in the fractures holding the separated rock faces in an open position
        forming a channel for flow of formation fluids back to the wellbore<br />(19)
        Proppant flowback is the transport of proppant sand back into the wellbore
        with the production of formation fluids following fracturing. This undesirable
        result causes undue wear on production equipment, the need for separation
        of solids from the produced fluids and occasionally also decreases the efficiency
        of the fracturing operation since the propane does not remain within the fracture
        and may limit the size of the created flow channel.<br />(20) Currently, the
        primary means for addressing the proppant flowback problem is to employ resin-coated
        proppants, resin consolidation of the proppant or forced closure techniques.
        The cost of resin-coated proppant is high, ranging from $0.20 to $0.40 per
        pound and is therefore used only as a tail-in the last five to twenty percent
        of the proppant sand placement. Resin-coated proppant is not always effective
        since there is some difficulty in placing it uniformly within the fractures
        and, additionally, the resin coating can have a deleterious effect on fracture
        conductivity. Resin coated proppant also interacts chemically with common
        fracturing fluid crosslinking systems such as guar or hydroxypropyl guar with
        organo-metallics or borate. This interaction results in altered crosslinking
        and/or break times for the fluids thereby affecting placement. Additionally,
        these chemicals can dissolve the coating on the resin-coated proppant making
        their use ineffective despite their high cost.<br />(21) In accordance with
        the present invention, the difficulties of using resin-coated proppants are
        overcome by incorporating an amount of fibrous material in intimate mixture
        with conventional proppants. The fibers act to bridge across constrictions
        and orifices in the proppant pack and to stabilize the proppant pack with
        no or minimal effect on proppant conductivity. While not wishing to be limited
        by theory, it appears that the fibers are dispersed within the sand and, at
        the onset of sand production from the fracture, the fibers become concentrated
        into a mat or other three-dimensional framework which holds the sand in place
        thereby limiting further proppant flowback with the fluid production.<br />(22)
        As used in this specification, the term `intimate mixture&quot; will be understood
        to mean a substantially uniform dispersion of components in a mixture. Similarly,
        the term &quot;simultaneous mixture&quot; will be understood to mean that
        the mixture components are blended in the initial steps of the process, i.e.,
        prior to pumping.<br />(23) Fiber length, thickness, density and concentration
        are important variables in the success of preventing proppant flowback. In
        accordance with the invention, the fiber length ranges upwardly from about
        2 millimeters and fiber diameter ranges of from about 3 to about 200 microns.
        There appear to be no upper limits on the length of the fibers employed from
        a stabilization standpoint. However, practical limitations of handling, mixing,
        and pumping equipment currently limit the practical use length of the fibers
        to about 100 millimeters. Fibrillated fibers can also be used and the diameters
        of the fibrils can be significantly smaller than the aforementioned fiber
        diameters. The fiber level used in the proppant pack can range from 0.01%
        to 50% by weight of the proppant sand. More preferably, the fiber concentration
        ranges from 0.1% to 5.0% by weight of proppant.<br />(24) The modulus or stiffness
        of the fiber appears to be important in determining performance. Modulus is
        a measure of the resistance to deformation of a material and is a material
        property rather than a sample phenomena. Stiffness is a sample specific number
        which depends on both the material and its dimensions. As a general rule,
        fibers with a modulus of about 70 GN/sq. m or greater are preferred. This
        includes materials like E-glass, S-glass, AR-glass, boron, aramids, and graphitized
        carbon fibers. Organic polymers other than the aramides usually have lower
        modulus values than this. Therefore, in order for organic polymers, such as
        nylon, to be useful in this application larger diameter fibers are required
        to provide equivalent performance to that of E-glass and stiffer materials.<br
        />(25) In the materials listed above, E-glass is a commercially available
        grade of glass fibers optimized for electrical applications, S-glass is used
        for strength applications and AR-glass has improved alkali resistance. These
        terms are common in the glass fiber industry and compositions of these types
        of glass are universally understood.<br />(26) A wide range of dimensions
        are useful. Length and diameter have been discussed above. An aspect ratio
        (ratio of length to diameter) in excess of 300 is preferred. The fiber can
        have a variety of shapes ranging from simple round or oval cross-sectional
        areas to more complex trilobe, figure eight, star shaped, rectangular cross-sectional
        areas or the like.<br />(27) Most commonly, straight fibers are used. Curved,
        crimped, spiral-shaped and other three dimensional fiber geometries are useful.
        Likewise, the fibers may be hooked on one or both ends. They may be of a composite
        structure, for example a glass fiber coated with resin to increase fiber-fiber
        adhesion.<br />(28) The materials from which the fibers are formed is not
        a key variable provided that the fibers do not chemically interact with components
        of the well treatment fluids and are stable in the subterranean environment.
        Thus, the fibers can be of glass, ceramic, carbon, natural or synthetic polymers
        or metal filaments. Mixtures of these fibers may also be advantageously employed.
        Glass, carbon and synthetic polymers are preferred for their low cost and
        relative chemical stability. The density of the fibers used is preferably
        greater than one gram per cc to avoid separation by flotation in the fluid/particulate
        slurry. Preferably, the fiber density is in the range of 1 to 4 grams per
        cc, closely mimicking the density of the particulate materials employed.<br
        />(29) Glass fibers are particularly preferred due to their relatively low
        cost, easy availability and high stiffness. Because of the fact that placement
        fluids and subterranean formation fluids tend to have an alkaline pH, it is
        most preferred to use an alkaline resistant glass (hereinafter AR-glass) having
        a high zirconium content. The use of more common, commercially available silica
        glasses is possible within the scope of this invention but, the solubility
        of these glasses in an alkaline medium, particularly at elevated temperatures,
        may affect the long term stability of the fiber/proppant mixture over its
        lifetime in the wellbore.<br />(30) A number of different proppants can be
        used in this invention. Sized sand and synthetic inorganic proppants are the
        most common. Examples include 40/60 sized sand, 20/40 sized sand, 16/20 sized
        sand, 12/20 sized sand and similarly sized ceramic proppants such as 37 CARBOLITE.TM.&quot;
        proppants.<br />(31) The proppant can be resin coated sand or ceramic proppant.
        Resin coated sand is used in some cases as a substitute for more expensive
        ceramic proppants because both are claimed to be more crush resistant than
        sand. The addition of fibers would aid in the control of proppant flowback
        or serve the other purposes described herein.<br />(32) The combination of
        resin coated sand and fibers would provide a stronger pack than either system
        alone. This may be useful in itself. In addition, the fibers could allow use
        of more highly precured resin coated proppants thereby minimizing the deleterious
        interaction of curable resin coated proppant with typical fracturing fluid
        components.<br />(33) The preferred job execution practice is to mix the fibrous
        material throughout the entire batch of proppant to be pumped during the job.
        This may be accomplished by adding the fiber to the proppant before it is
        mixed with the fluid, adding the fiber to the fluid before it is mixed with
        the proppant or by adding a slurry of fibers at some other stage, preferably
        before the slurry is pumped downhole.<br />(34) In certain cases, it may be
        preferred to pump the slurry of proppant and fiber only during a portion of
        the job, for example as the last 10-25% of the proppant into the fracture
        as a &quot;tail-in&quot; to control flow back in the most economical manner
        or for other reasons. The slug could also be pumped at other stages, for example
        to provide an absorbed scale inhibitor to be pumped to the front of the fracture.<br
        />(35) In certain cases, it may be desired to pump small slugs of the slurry
        of proppant and fiber in between slugs of slurry of proppant or to pump small
        slugs of a slurry of fiber between slugs of proppant slurry. This could conceivably
        be used to control flow dynamics down the fracture, for example by providing
        more plugflow-like behavior. Pumping of small slugs of slurry of fiber as
        the tail-in is one example of this general procedure.<br />(36) The slurry
        of a mixture of proppant and fibers is useful for various reasons in the entire
        range of reservoir applications from fracturing to sand control. This especially
        includes the newer technologies of frac-and-sand-pack and high permeability
        stimulation. In these applications formation permeabilities are typically
        higher than those for classical fracturing, extending into the 10 md to 2
        darcy range. As a result, the fractures are shorter (e.g. 10-200 ft) and wider
        (e.g. 1/2-2 inches) than classical fractures. Control of flowback of proppant
        on these types of jobs can reduce or eliminate the need for costly hardware
        such as gravel pack screens in the hole and simplify job design.<br />(37)
        The selection of fiber can be based on chemical as well as physical reasons.
        For example, in gravel packing and related applications where it is anticipated
        that the resulting pack-in-place will be treated with acid mixtures containing
        hydrofluoric acid, carbon fibers will be preferred over glass fibers when
        long life of the fibers is desired.<br />(38) The opposite may also be desired.
        Use of carbon fibers through the first 90% or so of the job followed by glass
        fibers in the tail-in would result in a pack which could be treated with solutions
        of hydrofluoric acid to dissolve the glass, allow flowback of a small portion
        of the sand at the face of the fracture and improve well productivity. Pumping
        alternate slugs of proppant/fiber slurries containing the different fibers
        could be followed by treatment with acid to produce fracture with high permeability
        zones (where the glass fibers were) but with stable proppant/fiber pack zones
        (where the carbon fibers were) to keep the fracture open.<br />(39) Beyond
        the advantages of avoiding proppant flowback, additional advantages have been
        noted in the use of fibrous materials in the well treatment fluid. The presence
        of fibers in the fluid slows the settling rate of the solid materials in the
        fluid thereby permitting the use of lesser amounts of polymeric gelling material
        in the placement fluid. This feature offers the advantages of less cost, greater
        retained permeability, a need for lower concentrations of breaker and avoidance
        of chemical interaction with the treatment fluid components.<br />(40) The
        fluid loss properties of the fibers are also available when fibers are incorporated
        into a proppant carrying fracturing fluid. In areas of high fluid loss, the
        fibers and sand will concentrate into a mat thereby limiting additional fluid
        loss in these areas.<br />(41) Fibers also offer an opportunity to place well
        treatment chemicals in a dispersed form within the proppant pack. Thus, porous
        or hollow or dissolvable fibers can be filled or formed with various materials
        such as polymer breakers, scale inhibitors, and/or paraffin and asphaltene
        inhibitors which can be slowly released within the pack.<br />(42) The following
        examples will illustrate several formulations incorporating fibers. It will
        be understood that the presentation of these examples is solely for the purpose
        of illustrating the invention and should not be considered in any way a limitation
        on the scope or applicability of the concept of the present invention.","backgroundTextHtml":null,"subHeadingM0Html":null,"subHeadingM1Html":null,"subHeadingM2Html":null,"subHeadingM3Html":null,"subHeadingM4Html":null,"subHeadingM5Html":null,"subHeadingM6Html":null,"usClassIssued":"166/280","issuedUsDigestRefClassifi":null,"datePublYear":"1995","applicationYear":"1994","pfDerwentWeekYear":null,"pfApplicationYear":null,"pfPublYear":null,"reissueApplNumber":null,"abstractHeader":null,"abstractedPublicationDerwent":null,"affidavit130BFlag":null,"affidavit130BText":null,"applicantGroup":null,"applicantHeader":null,"applicationFilingDateInt":19940308,"applicationFilingDateIntKwicHits":null,"applicationRefFilingType":null,"applicationReferenceGroup":null,"applicationSeriesAndNumber":null,"applicationSeriesCode":"08","assignee1":null,"assigneeDescriptiveText":["N/A"],"patentAssigneeTerms":null,"associateAttorneyName":null,"attorneyName":null,"biologicalDepositInformation":null,"applicationType":null,"unlinkedDerwentRegistryNumber":null,"unlinkedRingIndexNumbersRarerFragments":null,"claimStatement":"Having
