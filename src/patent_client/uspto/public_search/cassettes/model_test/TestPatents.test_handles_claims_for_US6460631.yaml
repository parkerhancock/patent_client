        including a sufficient amount of bearing surface area to contact the formation
        so as to generally distribute the weight of the bit against the bottom of
        the borehole without exceeding the compressive strength of the formation rock.","descriptionHtml":"BRIEF

        DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br />(2) FIG. 1 of the drawings depicts a rotary
        drag bit 10 looking upwardly at its face or leading end 12 as if the viewer
        were positioned at the bottom of a borehole. Bit 10 includes a plurality of
        PDC cutters 14 bonded by their substrates (diamond tables and substrates not
        shown separately for clarity), as by brazing, into pockets 16 in blades 18
        extending above the face 12, as is known in the art with respect to the fabrication
        of so-called &quot;matrix&quot; type bits. Such bits include a mass of metal
        powder, such as tungsten carbide, infiltrated with a molten, subsequently
        hardenable binder, such as a copper-based alloy. It should be understood,
        however, that the present invention is not limited to matrix-type bits, and
        that steel body bits and bits of other manufacture may also be configured
        according to the present invention.<br />(3) Fluid courses 20 lie between
        blades 18 and are provided with drilling fluid by nozzles 22 secured in nozzle
        orifices 24, orifices 24 being at the end of passages leading from a plenum
        extending into the bit body from a tubular shank at the upper, or trailing,
        end of the bit (see FIG. 2A in conjunction with the accompanying text for
        a description of these features). Fluid courses 20 extend to junk slots 26
        extending upwardly along the side of bit 10 between blades 18. Gage pads 19
        comprise longitudinally upward extensions of blades 18 and may have wear-resistant
        inserts or coatings on radially outer surfaces 21 thereof as known in the
        art. Formation cuttings are swept away from PDC cutters 14 by drilling fluid
        F emanating from nozzle orifices 24 which moves generally radially outwardly
        through fluid courses 20 and then upwardly through junk slots 26 to an annulus
        between the drill string from which the bit 10 is suspended and on to the
        surface.<br />(4) A plurality of the DOCC features, each comprising an arcuate
        bearing segment 30a through 30f, reside on, and in some instances bridge between,
        blades 18. Specifically, bearing segments 30b and 30e each reside partially
        on an adjacent blade 18 and extend therebetween. The arcuate bearing segments
        30a through 30f, each of which lies along substantially the same radius from
        the bit centerline as a PDC cutter 14 rotationally trailing that bearing segment
        30, together provide sufficient surface area to withstand the axial or longitudinal
        WOB without exceeding the compressive strength of the formation being drilled,
        so that the rock does not indent or fail and the penetration of PDC cutters
        14 into the rock is substantially controlled. As can be seen in FIG. 1, wear-resistant
        elements or inserts 32, in the form of tungsten carbide bricks or discs, diamond
        grit, diamond film, natural or synthetic diamond (PDC or TSP), or cubic boron
        nitride, may be added to the exterior bearing surfaces of bearing segments
        30 to reduce the abrasive wear thereof by contact with the formation under
        WOB as the bit 10 rotates under applied torque. In lieu of inserts, the bearing
        surfaces may be comprised of, or completely covered with, a wear-resistant
        material. The significance of wear characteristics of the DOCC features will
        be explained in more detail below.<br />(5) FIGS. 2 and 2A depict another
        embodiment of a rotary drill bit 100 according to the present invention, and
        features and elements in FIGS. 2 and 2A corresponding to those identified
        with respect to bit 10 of FIG. 1 are identified with the same reference numerals.
        FIG. 2 depicts a rotary drill bit 100 looking upwardly at its face 12 as if
        the viewer were positioned at the bottom of a borehole. Bit 100 also includes
        a plurality of PDC cutters 14 bonded by their substrates (diamond tables and
        substrates not shown separately for clarity), as by brazing, into pockets
        16 in blades 18 extending above the face 12 of bit 100.<br />(6) Fluid courses
        20 lie between blades 18 and are provided with drilling fluid F by nozzles
        22 secured in nozzle orifices 24, orifices 24 being at the end of passages
        36 leading from a plenum 38 extending into bit body 40 from a tubular shank
        42 threaded (not shown) on its exterior surface 44 as known in the art at
        the upper end of the bit (see FIG. 2A). Fluid courses 20 extend to junk slots
        26 extending upwardly along the side of bit 10 between blades 18. Gage pads
        19 comprise longitudinally upward extensions of blades 18 and may have wear-resistant
        inserts or coatings on radially outer surfaces 21 thereof as known in the
        art.<br />(7) A plurality of the DOCC features, each comprising an arcuate
        bearing segment 30a through 30f, reside on, and in some instances bridge between,
        blades 18. Specifically, bearing 30b and 30e each reside partially on an adjacent
        blade 18 and extend therebetween. The arcuate bearing segments 30a through
        30f, each of which lies substantially along the same radius from the bit centerline
        as a PDC cutter 14 rotationally trailing that bearing segment 30, together
        provide sufficient surface area to withstand the axial or longitudinal WOB
        without exceeding the compressive strength of the formation being drilled,
        so that the rock does not unduly indent or fail and the penetration of PDC
        cutters 14 into the rock is substantially controlled.<br />(8) By way of example
        only, the total DOCC features surface area for an 8.5 inch diameter bit generally
        configured as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 may be about 12 square inches. If, for
        example, the unconfined compressive strength of a relatively soft formation
        to be drilled by either bit 10 or 100 is 2,000 pounds per square inch (psi),
        then at least about 24,000 lbs. WOB may be applied without failing or indenting
        the formation. Such WOB is far in excess of the WOB which may normally be
        applied to a bit in such formations (for example, as little as 1,000 to 3,000
        lbs., up to about 5,000 lbs.) without incurring bit balling from excessive
        DOC and the consequent cuttings volume which overwhelms the bit''s hydraulic
        ability to clear them. In harder formations, with, for example, 20,000 to
        40,000 psi compressive strengths, the total DOCC features surface area may
        be significantly reduced while still accommodating substantial WOB applied
        to keep the bit firmly on the borehole bottom. When older, less sophisticated,
        drill rigs are employed or during directional drilling, both of which render
        it difficult to control WOB with any substantial precision, the ability to
        overload WOB without adverse consequences further distinguishes the superior
        performance of bits embodying the present invention. It should be noted at
        this juncture that the use of an unconfined compressive strength of formation
        rock provides a significant margin for calculation of the required bearing
        area of the DOCC features for a bit, as the in situ, confined, compressive
        strength of a subterranean formation being drilled is substantially higher.
        Thus, if desired, confined compressive strength values of selected formations
        may be employed in designing the total DOCC features as well as the total
        bearing area of a bit to yield a smaller required area, but which still advisedly
        provides for an adequate &quot;margin&quot; of excess bearing area in recognition
        of variations in continued compressive strengths of the formation to preclude
        substantial indentation and failure of the formation downhole.<br />(9) While
        bit 100 is notably similar to bit 10, the viewer will recognize and appreciate
        that wear inserts 32 are omitted from bearing segments on bit 100, such an
        arrangement being suitable for less abrasive formations where wear is of lesser
        concern and the tungsten carbide of the bit matrix (or applied hard facing
        in the case of a steel body bit) is sufficient to resist abrasive wear for
        a desired life of the bit. As shown in FIG. 13A, the DOCC features (bearing
        segments 30) of either bit 10 or bit 100, or of any bit according to the invention,
        may be of arcuate cross-section, taken transverse to the arc followed as the
        bit rotates, to provide an arcuate bearing surface 31a mimicking the cutting
        edge arc of an unworn, associated PDC cutter following a DOCC feature. Alternatively,
        as shown in FIG. 13B, a DOCC feature (bearing segment 30) may exhibit a flat
        bearing surface 31f to the formation, or may be otherwise configured. It is
        also contemplated, as shown in FIG. 13C, that a DOCC feature (bearing segment
        30) may be cross-sectionally configured and comprised of a material so as
        to intentionally and relatively quickly (in comparison to the wear rate of
        a PDC cutter) wear from a smaller initial bearing surface 31i providing a
        relatively small DOC.sub.1 with respect to the point or line of contact C
        with the formation traveled by the cutting edge of a trailing, associated
        PDC cutter while drilling a first, hard formation interval to a larger, secondary
        bearing surface 31s which also provides a much smaller DOC.sub.2 for a second,
        lower, much softer (and lower compressive strength) formation interval. Alternatively,
        the head 33 of the DOCC structure (bearing segment 30) may be made controllably
        shearable from the base 35 (as with frangible connections like a shear pin,
        one shear pin 37 shown in broken lines).<br />(10) For reference purposes,
        bits 10 and 100 as illustrated may be said to be symmetrical or concentric
        about their centerlines or longitudinal axes L, although this is not necessarily
        a requirement of the invention.<br />(11) Both bits 10 and 100 are unconventional
        in comparison to state of the art bits in that PDC cutters 14 on bits 10 and
        100 are disposed at far lesser backrakes, in the range of, for example, 7.degree.
        to 15.degree. with respect to the intended direction of rotation generally
        perpendicular to the surface of the formation being engaged. In comparison,
        many conventional bits are equipped with cutters at a 30.degree. backrake,
        and a 20.degree. backrake is regarded as somewhat &quot;aggressive&quot; in
        the art. The presence of the DOCC feature permits the use of substantially
        more aggressive backrakes, as the DOCC features preclude the aggressively
        raked PDC cutters from penetrating the formation to too great a depth, as
        would be the case in a bit without the DOCC features.<br />(12) In the cases
        of both bit 10 and bit 100, the rotationally leading DOCC features (bearing
        segments 30) are configured and placed to substantially exactly match the
        pattern drilled in the bottom of the borehole when drilling at an ROP of 100
        feet per hour (fph) at 120 rotations per minute (rpm) of the bit. This results
        in a DOC of about 0.166 inch per revolution. Due to the presence of the DOCC
        features (bearing segments 30), after sufficient WOB has been applied to drill
        100 fph, any additional WOB is transferred from the body 40 of the bit 10
        or 100 through the DOCC features to the formation. Thus, the cutters 14 are
        not exposed to any substantial additional weight, unless and until a WOB sufficient
        to fail the formation being drilled would be applied, which application may
        be substantially controlled by the driller, since the DOCC features may be
        engineered to provide a large margin of error with respect to any given sequence
        of formations which might be encountered when drilling an interval.<br />(13)
        As a further consequence of the present invention, the DOCC features would,
        as noted above, preclude cutters 14 from excessively penetrating or &quot;gouging&quot;
        the formation, a major advantage when drilling with a downhole motor where
        it is often difficult to control WOB and WOB inducing such excessive penetration
        can result in the motor stalling, with consequent loss of tool face and possible
        damage to motor components as well as to the bit itself. While the addition
        of WOB beyond that required to achieve the desired ROP will require additional
        torque to rotate the bit due to frictional resistance to rotation of the DOCC
        features over the formation, such additional torque is a lesser component
        of the overall torque.<br />(14) The benefit of DOCC features in controlling
        torque can readily be appreciated by a review of FIG. 3 of the drawings, which
        is a mathematical model of performance of a 3 3/4 inch diameter, four-bladed,
        Hughes Christensen R324XL PDC bit showing various torque versus WOB curves
        for varying cutter backrakes in drilling Mancos shale. Curve A represents
        the bit with a 10.degree. cutter backrake, curve B, the bit with a 20.degree.
        cutter backrake, curve C, the bit with a 30.degree. cutter backrake, and curve
        D, the bit using cutters disposed at a 20.degree. backrake and including the
        DOCC features according to the present invention. The model assumes a bit
        design according to the invention for an ROP of 50 fph at 100 rpm, which provides
        0.1 inch per revolution penetration of a formation being drilled. As can readily
        be seen, regardless of cutter backrake, curves A through C clearly indicate
        that, absent the DOCC features according to the present invention, required
        torque on the bit continues to increase continuously and substantially linearly
        with applied WOB, regardless of how much WOB is applied. On the other hand,
        curve D indicates that, after WOB approaches about 8,000 lbs. on the bit including
        the DOCC features, the torque curve flattens significantly and increases in
        a substantially linear manner only slightly from about 670 ft-lb. to just
        over 800 ft-lb. even as WOB approaches 25,000 lbs. As noted above, this relatively
        small increase in the torque after the DOCC features engage the formation
        is frictionally related, and is also somewhat predictable. As graphically
        depicted in FIG. 3, this additional torque load increases substantially linearly
        as a function of WOB times the coefficient of friction between the bit and
        the formation.<br />(15) Referring now to FIG. 4 (which is not to scale) of
        the drawings, a further appreciation of the operation and benefits of the
        DOCC features according to the present invention may be obtained. Assuming
        a bit designed for an ROP of 120 fph at 120 rpm, this requires an average
        DOC of 0.20 inch. The DOCC features or DOC limiters would thus be designed
        to first contact the subterranean formation surface FS to provide a 0.20 inch
        DOC. It is assumed for the purposes of FIG. 4 that DOCC features or DOC limiters
        are sized so that compressive strength of the formation being drilled is not
        exceeded under applied WOB. As noted previously, the compressive strength
        of concern would typically be the in situ compressive strength of the formation
        rock resident in the formation being drilled (plus some safety factor), rather
        than unconfined compressive strength of a rock sample. In FIG. 4, an exemplary
        PDC cutter 14 is shown, for convenience, moving linearly right to left on
        the page. One complete revolution of the bit 10 or 100 on which PDC cutter
        14 is mounted has been &quot;unscrolled&quot; and laid out flat in FIG. 4.
        Thus, as shown, PDC cutter 14 has progressed downwardly (i.e., along the longitudinal
        axis of the bit 10 or 100 on which it is mounted) 0.20 inch in 360.degree.
        of rotation of the bit 10 or 100. As shown in FIG. 4, a structure or element
        to be used as a DOC limiter 50 is located conventionally, closely rotationally
        &quot;behind&quot; PDC cutter 14, as only 22.5.degree. behind PDC cutter 14,
        the outermost tip 50a must be recessed upwardly 0.0125 inch (0.20 inch DOC.times.22.5.degree./360.degree.)
        from the outermost tip 14a of PDC cutter 14 to achieve an initial 0.20 inch
        DOC. However, when DOC limiter 50 wears during drilling, for example by a
        mere 0.010 inch relative to the tip 14a of PDC cutter 14, the vertical offset
        distance between the tip 50a of DOC limiter 50 and tip 14a of PDC cutter 14
        is increased to 0.0225 inch. Thus, DOC will be substantially increased, in
        fact, almost doubled, to 0.36 inch. Potential ROP would consequently equal
        216 fph due to the increase in vertical standoff provided PDC cutter 14 by
        worn DOC limiter 50, but the DOC increase may damage PDC cutter 14 or ball
        the bit 10 or 100 by generating a volume of formation cuttings which overwhelms
        the bit''s ability to clear them hydraulically. Similarly, if PDC cutter tip
        14a wore at a relatively faster rate than DOC limiter 50 by, for example,
        0.010 inch, the vertical offset distance is decreased to 0.0025 inch, DOC
        is reduced to 0.04 inch and ROP, to 24 fph. Thus, excessive wear or vertical
        misplacement of either PDC cutter 14 or DOC limiter 50 to the other may result
        in a wide range of possible ROPs for a given rotational speed. On the other
        hand, if an exemplary DOCC feature 60 is placed, according to the present
        invention, 45.degree. rotationally in front of (or 315.degree. rotationally
        behind) PDC cutter tip 14a, the outermost tip 60a would initially be recessed
        upwardly 0.175 inch (0.20 inch DOC.times.315.degree./360.degree.) relative
        to PDC cutter tip 14a to provide the initial 0.20 inch DOC. FIG. 4 shows the
        same DOCC feature 60 twice, both rotationally in front of and behind PDC cutter
        14, for clarity, it being, of course, understood that the path of PDC cutter
        14 is circular throughout a 360.degree. arc in accordance with rotation of
        bit 10 or 100. When DOCC feature 60 wears 0.010 inch relative to PDC cutter
        tip 14a, the vertical offset distance between tip 60a of DOCC feature 60 and
        tip 14a of PDC cutter 14 is only increased from 0.175 inch to 0.185 inch.
        However, due to the placement of DOCC feature 60 relative to PDC cutter 14,
        DOC will be only slightly increased to about 0.211 inch. As a consequence,
        ROP would only increase to about 127 fph. Likewise, if PDC cutter 14 wears
        0.010 inch relative to DOCC feature 60, vertical offset of DOCC feature 60
        is only reduced to 0.165 inch and DOC is only reduced to about 0.189 inch,
        with an attendant ROP of about 113 fph. Thus, it can readily be seen how rotational
        placement of a DOCC feature can significantly affect ROP as the limiter or
        the cutter wears with respect to the other, or if one such component has been
        misplaced or incorrectly sized to protrude incorrectly even slightly upwardly
        or downwardly of its ideal, or &quot;design,&quot; position relative to the
        other, associated component when the bit is fabricated. Similarly, mismatches
        in wear between a cutter and a cutter-trailing DOC limiter are magnified in
        the prior art, while being significantly reduced when DOCC features sized
        and placed in cutter-leading positions according to the present invention
        are employed. Further, if a DOC limiter trailing, rather than leading, a given
        cutter is employed, it will be appreciated that shock or impact loading of
        the cutter is more probable as, by the time the DOC limiter contacts the formation,
        the cutter tip will have already contacted the formation. Leading DOCC features,
        on the other hand, by being located in advance of a given cutter along the
        downward helical path the cutter travels as it cuts the formation and the
        bit advances along its longitudinal axis, tend to engage the formation before
        the cutter. The terms &quot;leading&quot; and &quot;trailing&quot; the cutter
        may be easily understood as being preferably respectively associated with
        DOCC features positions up to 180.degree. rotationally preceding a cutter
        versus positions up to 180.degree. rotationally trailing a cutter. While some
        portion of, for example, an elongated, arcuate leading DOCC feature according
        to the present invention may extend so far rotationally forward of an associated
        cutter so as to approach a trailing position, the substantial majority of
        the arcuate length of such a DOCC feature would preferably reside in a leading
        position. As may be appreciated by further reference to FIGS. 1 and 2, there
        may be a significant rotational spacing between a PDC cutter 14 and an associated
        bearing segment 30 of a DOCC feature, as across a fluid course 20 and its
        associated junk slot 26, while still rotationally leading the PDC cutter 14.
        More preferably, at least some portion of a DOCC feature according to the
        invention will lie within about 90.degree. rotationally preceding the face
        of an associated cutter.<br />(16) One might question why limitation of ROP
        would be desirable, as bits according to the present invention using DOCC
        features may not, in fact, drill at as great an ROP as conventional bits not
        so equipped. However, as noted above, by using DOCC features to achieve a
        predictable and substantially sustainable DOC in conjunction with a known
        ability of a bit''s hydraulics to clear formation cuttings from the bit at
        a given maximum volumetric rate, a sustainable (rather than only peak) maximum
        ROP may be achieved without the bit balling and with reduced cutter wear and
        substantial elimination of cutter damage and breakage from excessive DOC,
        as well as impact-induced damage and breakage. Motor stalling and loss of
        tool face may also be eliminated. In soft or ultra-soft formations very susceptible
        to balling, limiting the unit volume of rock removed from the formation per
        unit time prevents a bit from &quot;over cutting&quot; the formation. In harder
        formations, the ability to apply additional WOB in excess of what is needed
        to achieve a design DOC for the bit may be used to suppress unwanted vibration
        normally induced by the PDC cutters and their cutting action, as well as unwanted
        drill string vibration in the form of bounce, manifested on the bit by an
        excessive DOC. In such harder formations, the DOCC features may also be characterized
        as &quot;load arresters&quot; used in conjunction with &quot;excess&quot;
        WOB to protect the PDC cutters from vibration-induced damage, the DOCC features
        again being sized so that the compressive strength of the formation is not
        exceeded. In harder formations, the ability to damp out vibrations and bounce
        by maintaining the bit in constant contact with the formation is highly beneficial
        in terms of bit stability and longevity, while in steerable applications the
        invention precludes loss of tool face.<br />(17) FIG. 5 depicts one exemplary
        variation of a DOCC feature according to the present invention, which may
        be termed a &quot;stepped&quot; DOCC feature 130 comprising an elongated,
        arcuate bearing segment. Such a configuration, shown for purposes of illustration
        preceding a PDC cutter 14 on a bit 100 (by way of example only), includes
        a lower, rotationally leading first step 132 and a higher, rotationally trailing
        second step 134. As tip 14a of PDC cutter 14 follows its downward helical
        path generally indicated by line 140 (the path, as with FIG. 4, being unscrolled
        on the page), the surface area of first step 132 may be used to limit DOC
        in a harder formation with a greater compressive strength, the bit &quot;riding&quot;
        high on the formation with cutter 14 taking a minimal DOC.sub.1 in the formation
        surface, shown by the lower dashed line. However, as bit 100 enters a much
        softer formation with a far lesser compressive strength, the surface area
        of first step 132 will be insufficient to prevent indentation and failure
        of the formation, and so first step 132 will indent the formation until the
        surface of second step 134 encounters the formation material, increasing DOC
        by cutter 14. At that point, the total surface area of first and second steps
        132 and 134 (in combination with other first and second steps respectively
        associated with other cutters 14) will be sufficient to prevent further indentation
        of the formation and the deeper DOC.sub.2 in the surface of the softer formation
        (shown by the upper dashed line) will be maintained until the bit 100 once
        again encounters a harder formation. When this occurs, the bit 100 will ride
        up on the first step 132, which will take any impact from the encounter before
        cutter 14 encounters the formation, and the DOC will be reduced to its previous
        DOC level, avoiding excessive torque and motor stalling.<br />(18) As shown
        in FIGS. 1 and 2, one or more DOCC features of a bit according to an invention
        may comprise elongated arcuate bearing segments 30 disposed at substantially
        the same radius about the bit longitudinal axis or centerline as a cutter
        preceded by that DOCC feature. In such an instance, and as depicted in FIG.
        6A with exemplary arcuate bearing segment 30 unscrolled to lie flat on the
        page, it is preferred that the outer bearing surface S of a segment 30 be
        sloped at an angle .alpha. to a plane P transverse to the centerline L of
        the bit substantially the same as the angle .beta. of the (helical path 140)
        traveled by associated PDC cutter 14 as the bit drills the borehole. By so
        orienting the outer bearing surface S, the full potential surface, or bearing
        area of bearing segment 30 contacts and remains in contact with the formation
        as the PDC cutter 14 rotates. As shown in FIG. 6B, the outer surface S of
        an arcuate segment may also be sloped at a variable angle to accommodate maximum
        and minimum design ROP for a bit. Thus, if a bit is designed to drill between
        110 and 130 fph, the rotationally leading portion LS of surface S may be at
        one, relatively shallower angle .gamma., while the rotationally trailing portion
        TS of surface S (all of surface S still rotationally leading PDC cutter 14)
        may be at another, relatively steeper angle .delta., (both angles shown in
        exaggerated magnitude for clarity) the remainder of surface S gradually transitioning
        in an angle therebetween. In this manner, and since DOC must necessarily increase
        for ROP to increase, given a substantially constant rotational speed, at a
        first, shallower helix angle 140a corresponding to a lower ROP, the leading
        portion LS of surface S will be in contact with the formation being drilled,
        while at a higher ROP the helix angle will steepen, as shown (exaggerated
        for clarity) by helix angle 140b and leading portion LS will no longer contact
        the formation, the contact area being transitioned to more steeply angled
        trailing portion TS. Of course, at an ROP intermediate the upper and lower
        limits of the design range, a portion of surface S intermediate leading portion
        LS and trailing portion TS (or portions of both LS and TS) would act as the
        bearing surface. A configuration as shown in FIG. 6B is readily suitable for
        high compressive strength formations at varying ROP''s within a design range,
        since bearing surface area requirements for the DOCC features are nominal.
        For bits used in drilling softer formations, it may be necessary to provide
        excess surface area for each DOCC feature to prevent formation failure and
        indentation, as only a portion of each DOCC feature will be in contact with
        the formation at any one time when drilling over a design range of ROPs. Conversely,
        for bits used in drilling harder formations, providing excess surface area
        for each DOCC feature to prevent formation failure and indentation may not
        be necessary as the respective portions of each DOCC feature may, when taken
        in combination, provide enough total bearing surface area, or total size,
        for the bit to ride on the formation over a design range of ROPs.<br />(19)
        Another consideration in the design of bits according to the present invention
        is the abrasivity of the formation being drilled, and relative wear rates
        of the DOCC features and the PDC cutters. In non-abrasive formations this
        is not of major concern, as neither the DOCC feature nor the PDC cutter will
        wear appreciably. However, in more abrasive formations, it may be necessary
        to provide wear inserts 32 (see FIG. 1) or otherwise protect the DOCC features
        against excessive (i.e., premature) wear in relation to the cutters with which
        they are associated to prevent reduction in DOC. For example, if the bit is
        a matrix-type bit, a layer of diamond grit may be embedded in the outer surfaces
        of the DOCC features. Alternatively, preformed cemented tungsten carbide slugs
        cast into the bit face may be used as DOCC features. A diamond film may be
        formed on selected portions of the bit face using known chemical vapor deposition
        techniques as known in the art, or diamond films formed on substrates which
        are then cast into or brazed or otherwise bonded to the bit body. Natural
        diamonds, thermally stable PDCs (commonly termed TSPs) or even PDCs with their
        faces substantially parallel to the helix angle of the cutter path (so that
        what would normally be the cutting face of the PDC acts as a bearing surface),
        or cubic boron nitride structures similar to the aforementioned diamond structures
        may also be employed on, or as, bearing surfaces of the DOCC features, as
        desired or required, for example when drilling in limestones and dolomites.
        In order to reduce frictional forces between a DOCC bearing surface and the
        formation, a very low roughness, so-called &quot;polished&quot; diamond surface
        may be employed in accordance with U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,447,208 and 5,653,300,
        assigned to the assignee of the present invention and hereby incorporated
        herein by this reference. Ideally, and taking into account wear of the diamond
        table and supporting substrate in comparison to wear of the DOCC features,
        the wear characteristics and volumes of materials taking the wear for the
        DOCC features may be adjusted so that the wear rate of the DOCC features may
        be substantially matched to the wear rate of the PDC cutters to maintain a
        substantially constant DOC. This approach will result in the ability to use
        the PDC cutter to its maximum potential life. It is, of course, understood
        that the DOCC features may be configured as abbreviated &quot;knots,&quot;
        &quot;bosses,&quot; or large &quot;mesas&quot; as well as the aforementioned
        arcuate segments or may be of any other configuration suitable for the formation
        to be drilled to prevent failure thereof by the DOCC features under expected
        or planned WOB.<br />(20) As an alternative to a fixed, or passive, DOCC feature,
        it is also contemplated that active DOCC features or bearing segments may
        be employed to various ends. For example, rollers may be disposed in front
        of the cutters to provide reduced-friction DOCC features, or a fluid bearing
        comprising an aperture surrounded by a pad or mesa on the bit face may be
        employed to provide a standoff for the cutters with attendant low friction.
        Movable DOCC features, for example pivotable structures, might also be used
        to accommodate variations in ROP within a given range by tilting the bearing
        surfaces of the DOCC features so that the surfaces are oriented at the same
        angle as the helical path of the associated cutters.<br />(21) Referring now
        to FIGS. 7 though 12 of the drawings, various DOCC features (which may also
        be referred to as bearing segments) according to the invention are disclosed.<br
        />(22) Referring to FIGS. 7 and 7A, exemplary bit 150 having PDC cutter 14
        secured thereto rotationally trailing fluid course 20 includes pivotable DOCC
        feature 160 comprised of an arcuate-surfaced body 162 (which may comprise
        a hemisphere for rotation about several axes or merely an arcuate surface
        extending transverse to the plane of the page for rotation about an axis transverse
        to the page) secured in socket 164 and having an optional wear-resistant feature
        166 on the bearing surface 168 thereof Wear-resistant feature 166 may merely
        be an exposed portion of the material of body 162 if the latter is formed
        of, for example, WC. Alternatively, wear-resistant feature 166 may comprise
        a WC tip, insert or cladding on bearing surface 168 of body 162, diamond grit
        embedded in body 162 at bearing surface 168, or a synthetic or natural diamond
        surface treatment of bearing surface 168, including specifically and without
        limitation, a diamond film deposited thereon or bonded thereto. It should
        be noted that the area of the bearing surface 168 of the DOCC feature 160
        which will ride on the formation being drilled, as well as the DOC for PDC
        cutter 14, may be easily adjusted for a given bit design by using bodies 162
        exhibiting different exposures (heights) of the bearing surface 168 and different
        widths, lengths or cross-sectional configurations, all as shown in broken
        lines. Thus, different formation compressive strengths may be accommodated.
        The use of a pivotable DOCC feature 160 permits the DOCC feature to automatically
        adjust to different ROPs within a given range of cutter helix angles. While
        DOC may be affected by pivoting of the DOCC feature 160, variation within
        a given range of ROPs will usually be nominal.<br />(23) FIGS. 8 and 8A depict
        exemplary bit 150 having PDC cutter 14 secured thereto rotationally trailing
        fluid course 20, wherein bit 150 in this instance includes DOCC feature 170
        including roller 172 rotationally mounted by shaft 174 to bearings 176 carried
        by bit 150 on each side of cavity 178 in which roller 172 is partially received.
        In this embodiment, it should be noted that the exposure and bearing surface
        area of DOCC feature 170 may be easily adjusted for a given bit design by
        using different diameter rollers 172 exhibiting different widths and/or cross-sectional
        configurations.<br />(24) FIGS. 9A, 9B, 9C and 9D respectively depict alternative
        pivotable DOCC features 190, 200, 210 and 220. DOCC feature 190 includes a
        head 192 partially received in a cavity 194 in a bit 150 and mounted through
        a ball and socket connection 196 to a stud 180 press-fit into aperture 198
        at the top of cavity 194. DOCC features 200, wherein elements similar to those
        of DOCC feature 190 are identified by the same reference numerals, is a variation
        of DOCC feature 190. DOCC feature 210 employs a head 212 which is partially
        received in a cavity 214 in a bit 150 and secured thereto by a resilient or
        ductile connecting element 216 which extends into aperture 218 at the top
        of cavity 214. Connecting element 216 may comprise, for example, an elastomeric
        block, a coil spring, a belleville spring, a leaf spring, or a block of ductile
        metal, such as steel or bronze. Thus, connecting element 216, as with the
        ball and socket connections 196 and heads 192, permits head 212 to automatically
        adjust to, or compensate for, varying ROPs defining different cutter helix
        angles. DOCC feature 220 employs a yoke 222 rotationally disposed and partially
        received within cavity 224, yoke 222 supported on protrusion 226 of bit 150.
        Stops 228, of resilient or ductile materials (such as elastomers, steel, lead,
        etc.) and which may be permanent or replaceable, permit yoke 222 to accommodate
        various helix angles. Yoke 222 may be secured within cavity 224 by any conventional
        means. Since helix angles vary even for a given, specific ROP as distance
        of each cutter from the bit centerline, affording such automatic adjustment
        or compensation may be preferable to trying to form DOCC features with bearing
        surfaces at different angles at different locations over the bit face.<br
        />(25) FIGS. 10A and 10B respectively depict different DOCC features and PDC
        cutter combinations. In each instance, a PDC cutter 14 is secured to a combined
        cutter carrier and DOC limiter 240, the carrier 240 being received within
        a cavity 242 in the face (or on a blade) of an exemplary bit 150 and secured
        therein as by brazing, welding, mechanical fastening, or otherwise as known
        in the art. DOC limiter 240 includes a protrusion 244 exhibiting a bearing
        surface 246. As shown and by way of example only, bearing surface 246 may
        be substantially flat (FIG. 10A) or hemispherical (FIG. 10B). By selecting
        an appropriate cutter carrier and DOC limiter 240, the DOC of PDC cutter 14
        may be varied and the surface area of bearing surface 246 adjusted to accommodate
        a target formation''s compressive strength.<br />(26) It should be noted that
        the DOCC features of FIGS. 7 through 10, in addition to accommodating different
        formation compressive strengths as well as optimizing DOC and permitting minimization
        of friction-causing bearing surface area while preventing formation failure
        under WOB, also facilitate field repair and replacement of DOCC features due
        to drilling damage or to accommodate different formations to be drilled in
        adjacent formations, or intervals, to be penetrated by the same borehole.<br
        />(27) FIG. 11 depicts a DOCC feature 250 comprised of an annular cavity or
        channel 252 in the face of an exemplary bit 150. Radially adjacent PDC cutters
        14 flanking annular channel 252 cut the formation 254 but for uncut annular
        segment 256, which protrudes into annular cavity 252. At the top 260 of annular
        channel 252, a flat-edged PDC cutter 258 (or preferably a plurality of rotationally
        spaced cutters 258) truncates annular segment 256 in a controlled manner so
        that the height of annular segment 256 remains substantially constant and
        limits the DOC of flanking PDC cutters 14. In this instance, the bearing surface
        of the DOCC feature 250 comprises the top 260 of annular channel 252, and
        the sides 262 of channel 252 prevent collapse of annular segment 256. Of course,
        it is understood that multiple annular channels 252 with flanking PDC cutters
        14 may be employed, and that a source of drilling fluid, such as aperture
        264, would be provided to lubricate channel 252 and flush formation cuttings
        from cutter 258.<br />(28) FIGS. 12 and 12A depict a low-friction, hydraulically
        enhanced DOCC feature 270 comprised of a DOCC pad 272 rotationally leading
        a PDC cutter 14 across fluid course 20 on exemplary bit 150, pad 272 being
        provided with drilling fluid through passage 274 leading to the bearing surface
        276 of pad 272 from a plenum 278 inside the body of bit 150. As shown in FIG.
        12A, a plurality of channels 282 may be formed on bearing surface 276 to facilitate
        distribution of drilling fluid from the mouth 280 of passage 274 across bearing
        surface 276. By diverting a small portion of drilling fluid flow to the bit
        150 from its normal path leading to nozzles associated with the cutters, it
        is believed that the increased friction normally attendant with WOB increases
        after the bearing surface 276 of DOCC pad 272 contacts the formation may be
        at least somewhat alleviated, and in some instances substantially avoided,
        reducing or eliminating torque increases responsive to increases of WOB. Of
        course, passages 274 may be sized to provide appropriate flow, or pads 272
        sized with appropriately dimensioned mouths 280. Pads 272 may, of course,
        be configured for replaceability.<br />(29) As has been mentioned above, backrakes
        of the PDC cutters employed in a bit equipped with DOCC features according
        to the invention may be more aggressive, that is to say, less negative, than
        with conventional bits. It is also contemplated that extremely aggressive
        cutter rakes, including neutral rakes and even positive (forward) rakes of
        the cutters may be successfully employed consistent with the cutters'' inherent
        strength to withstand the loading thereon as a consequence of such rakes,
        since the DOCC features will prevent such aggressive cutters from engaging
        the formation to too great a depth.<br />(30) It is also contemplated that
        two different heights, or exposures, of bearing segments may be employed on
        a bit, a set of higher bearing segments providing a first bearing surface
        area supporting the bit on harder, higher compressive strength formations
        providing a relatively shallow DOC for the PDC cutters of the bit, while a
        set of lower bearing segments remains out of contact with the formation while
        drilling until a softer, lower compressive stress formation is encountered.
        At that juncture, the higher or more exposed bearing segments will be of insufficient
        surface area to prevent indentation (failure) of the formation rock under
        applied WOB. Thus, the higher bearing segments will indent the formation until
        the second set of bearing segments comes in contact therewith, whereupon the
        combined surface area of the two sets of bearing segments will support the
        bit on the softer formation, but at a greater DOC to permit the cutters to
        remove a greater volume of formation material per rotation of the bit and
        thus generate a higher ROP for a given bit rotational speed. This approach
        differs from the approach illustrated in FIG. 5 in that, unlike stepped DOCC
        features (bearing segment 130), bearing segments of differing heights or exposures
        are associated with different cutters. Thus, this aspect of the invention
        may be effected, for example, in the bits 10 and 100 of FIGS. 1 and 2 by fabricating
        selected arcuate bearing segments to a greater height or exposure than others.
        Thus, bearing segments 30b and 30e of bits 10 and 100 may exhibit a greater
        exposure than segments 30a, 3c, 30d and 30f, or vice versa.<br />(31) Cutters
        employed with bits 10 and 100, as well as other bits disclosed that will be
        discussed subsequently herein, are depicted as having PDC cutters 14, but
        it will be recognized and appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art
        that the invention may also be practiced on bits carrying other types of superabrasive
        cutters, such as thermally stable polycrystalline diamond compacts, or TSPs,
        for example arranged into a mosaic pattern as known in the art to simulate
        the cutting face of a PDC. Diamond film cutters may also be employed, as well
        as cubic boron nitride compacts.<br />(32) Another embodiment of the present
        invention, as exemplified by rotary drill bit 300 and 300'', is depicted in
        FIGS. 14A-20. Rotary drill bits such as drill bits 300 and 300'', according
        to the present invention, may include many features and elements which correspond
        to those identified with respect to previously described and illustrated bits
        10 and 100.<br />(33) Representative rotary drill bit 300 shown in FIGS. 14A
        and 14B, includes a bit body 301 having a leading end 302 and a trailing end
        304. Connection 306 may comprise a pin-end connection having tapered threads
        for connecting bit 300 to a bottom hole assembly of a conventional rotating
        drill string, or alternatively for connection to a downhole motor assembly
        such as a drilling fluid powered Moineau-type downhole motor, as described
        earlier. Leading end, or drill bit face, 302 includes a plurality of blade
        structures 308 generally extending radially outwardly and longitudinally toward
        trailing end 304. Exemplary bit 300 comprises eight blade structures, or blades,
        308 spaced circumferentially about the bit. However, a fewer number of blades
        may be provided on a bit such as provided on bit body 301'' of bit 300'' shown
        in FIG. 14C which has six blades. A greater number of blade structures of
        a variety of geometries may be utilized as determined to be optimum for a
        particular drill bit. Furthermore, blades 308 need not be equidistantly spaced
        about the circumference of drill bit 300 as shown, but may be spaced about
        the circumference, or periphery, of a bit in any suitable fashion including
        a non-equidistant arrangement or an arrangement wherein some of the blades
        are spaced circumferentially equidistantly from each other and wherein some
        of the blades are irregularly, non-equidistantly spaced from each other. Moreover,
        blades 308 need not be specifically configured in the manner as shown in FIGS.
        14A and 14B, but may be configured to include other profiles, sizes, and combinations
        than those shown.<br />(34) Generally, a bit, such as bit 300, includes a
        cone region 310, a nose region 312, a flank region 314, a shoulder region
        316, and a gage region 322. Frequently, a specific distinction between flank
        region 314 and shoulder region 316 may not be made. Thus, the term &quot;shoulder,&quot;
        as used in the art, will often incorporate the &quot;flank&quot; region within
        the &quot;shoulder&quot; region. Fluid ports 318 are disposed about the face
        of the bit and are in fluid communication with at least one interior passage
        provided in the interior of bit body 301 in a manner such as illustrated in
        FIG. 2A of the drawings and for the purposes described previously herein.
        Preferably, but not necessarily, fluid ports 318 include nozzles 338 disposed
        therein to better control the expulsion of drilling fluid from bit body 301
        into fluid courses 344 and junk slots 340 in order to facilitate the cooling
        of cutters on bit 300 and the flushing of formation cuttings up the borehole
        toward the surface when bit 300 is in operation.<br />(35) Blades 308 preferably
        comprise, in addition to gage region 322 of blades 308, a radially outward
        facing bearing surface 320, a rotationally leading surface 324, and a rotationally
        trailing surface 326. That is, as the bit is rotated in a subterranean formation
        to create a borehole, leading surface 324 will be facing the intended direction
        of bit rotation while trailing surface 326 will be facing opposite, or backwards
        from, the intended direction of bit rotation. A plurality of cutting elements,
        or cutters, 328 are preferably disposed along and partially within blades
        308. Specifically, cutters 328 are positioned so as to have a superabrasive
        cutting face, or table, 330 generally facing in the same direction as leading
        surface 324 as well as to be exposed to a certain extent beyond bearing surface
        320 of the respective blade in which each cutter is positioned. Cutters 328
        are preferably superabrasive cutting elements known within the art, such as
        the exemplary PDC cutters described previously herein, and are physically
        secured in pockets 342 by installation and securement techniques known in
        the art. The preferred amount of exposure of cutters 328 in accordance with
        the present invention will be described in further detail hereinbelow.<br
        />(36) Optional wear knots, wear clouds, or built-up wear-resistant areas
        334, collectively referred to as wear knots 334 herein, may be disposed upon,
        or otherwise provided on bearing surfaces 320 of blades 308 with wear knots
        334 preferably being positioned so as to rotationally follow cutters 328 positioned
        on respective blades or other surfaces in which cutters 328 are disposed.
        Wear knots 334 may be originally molded into bit 300 or may be added to selected
        portions of bearing surface 320. As described earlier herein, bearing surfaces
        320 of blades 308 may be provided with other wear-resistant features or characteristics
        such as embedded diamonds, TSPs, PDCs, hard facing, weldings, and weldments
        for example. As will become apparent, such wear-resistant features can be
        employed to further enhance and augment the DOCC aspect as well as other beneficial
        aspects of the present invention.<br />(37) FIGS. 15A-15C highlight the extent
        in which cutters 328 are exposed with respect to the surface immediately surrounding
        cutters 328 and particularly cutters 328C located within the radially innermost
        region of the leading end of a bit proximate the longitudinal centerline of
        the bit. FIG. 15A provides a schematic representation of a representative
        group of cutters provided on a bit as the bit rotatingly engages a formation
        with the cutter profile taken in cross-section and projected onto a single,
        representative vertical plane (i.e., the drawing sheet). Cutters 328 are generally
        radially, or laterally, positioned along the face of the leading end of a
        bit, such as representative bit 300, so as to provide a selected center-to-center
        radial, or lateral spacing between cutters referred to as center-to-center
        cutter spacing R.sub.s. Thus, if a bit is provided with a blade structure,
        such as blade 308, the cutter profile of 15A represents the cutters positioned
        on a single representative blade 308. As exaggeratedly illustrated in FIG.
        15A, cutters 328C located in cone region 310 are preferably disposed into
        blade 308 so as to have a cutter exposure H.sub.c generally perpendicular
        to the outwardly face bearing surface 320 of blade 308 by a selected amount.
        As can be seen in FIG. 15A, cutter exposure H.sub.c is of a preferably relative
        small amount of standoff, or exposure, distance in cone region 310 of bit
        300. Preferably, cutter exposure H.sub.c generally differs for each of the
        cutters or groups of cutters positioned more radially distant from centerline
        L. For example cutter exposure H.sub.c is generally greater for cutters 328
        in nose region 312 than it is for cutters 328 located in cone region 310 and
        cutter exposure H.sub.c is preferably at a maximum in flank/shoulder regions
        314/316. Cutter exposure H.sub.c preferably diminishes slightly radially toward
        gage region 322, and radially outermost cutters 328 positioned longitudinally
        proximate gage pad surface 354 of gage region 322 may incorporate cutting
        faces of smaller cross-sectional diameters as illustrated. Gage line 352 (see
        FIGS. 16 and 17) defines the maximum outside diameter of bit 300.<br />(38)
        The cross-sectional profile of optional wear knots, wear clouds, hard facing,
        or surface welds 334 have been omitted for clarity in FIG. 15A. However, FIG.
        15C depicts the rotational cross-sectional profile, as superimposed upon a
        single, representative vertical plane, of representative optional wear knots,
        wear clouds, hard facing, surface welds, or other wear knot structures 334.
        FIG. 15C further illustrates an exemplary cross-sectional wear knot height
        H.sub.wk measured generally perpendicular to outwardly face bearing surface
        320. There may or may not be a generally radial dimensional difference, or
        relief, .DELTA.H.sub.c-wk, between wear knot height H.sub.wk, which generally
        corresponds to a radially outermost surface of a given wear knot or structure,
        and respective cutter exposure H.sub.c, which generally corresponds to the
        radially outermost portion of the rotationally associated cutter, to further
        provide a DOCC feature in accordance with the present invention. Conceptually,
        these differences in exposures can be regarded as analogous to the distance
        of cutter 14 and rotationally trailing DOC limiter 50 as measured from the
        dashed reference line illustrated in FIG. 4 and as described earlier. Furthermore,
        instead of referring to the distance in which the radially outermost surface
        of a given wear knot structure is positioned radially outward from a bearing
        surface or blade structure in which a particular wear knot structure is disposed
        upon, it may be helpful to alternatively refer to a preselected distance in
        which the radially outermost surface of a given wear knot structure is radially/longitudinally
        inset, or relieved from the outermost portion of the exposed portion of a
        rotationally associated superabrasive cutter as denoted as .DELTA.H.sub.c-wk
        in FIG. 15C. Thus, in addition to controlling the DOC with at least certain
        cutters, and perhaps every cutter, by selecting an appropriate cutter exposure
        height H.sub.c as defined and illustrated herein, the present invention further
        encompasses optionally providing drill bits with wear knots, or other similar
        cutter depth limiting structures, to complement, or augment, the control of
        the DOCs of respectively rotationally associated cutters wherein such optionally
        provided wear knots are disposed on the bit so as to have a wear knot surface
        that is positioned, or relieved, a preselected distance .DELTA.H.sub.c-wk
        as measured from the outermost exposed portion of the cutter in which a wear
        knot is rotationally associated to the wear knot surface.<br />(39) The superimposed
        cross-sectional cutter profile of a representative drill bit such as bit 300
        in FIG. 15B depicts the combined profile of all cutters installed on each
        of a plurality of blades 308 so as to have a selected center-to-center radial
        cutter spacing R.sub.s. Thus, the cutter profile illustrated in FIG. 15B is
        the result of all of the cutters provided on a plurality of blades and rotated
        about the centerline of the bit to be superimposed upon a single, representative
        blade 308. In some embodiments, there will likely be several cutter redundancies
        at identical radial locations between various cutters positioned on respective,
        circumferentially spaced blades, and, for clarity, such profiles which are
        perfectly, or absolutely, redundant are typically not illustrated. As can
        be seen in FIG. 15B, there will be a lateral, or radial, overlap between respective
        cutter paths as the variously provided cutters rotationally progress generally
        tangential to longitudinal axis L as the bit 300 rotates so as to result in
        a uniform cutting action being achieved as the drill bit rotatingly engages
        a formation under a selected WOB. Additionally, it can be seen in FIG. 15B
        that the lateral, or radial, spacing between individual cutter profiles need
        not be of the same, uniform distance with respect to the radial, or lateral,
        position of each cutter. This non-uniform spacing with respect to the radial,
        or lateral, positioning of each cutter is more clearly illustrated in FIGS.
        16 and 17.<br />(40) FIGS. 16 and 17 are enlarged, isolated partial cross-sectional
        cutter profile views to which all of the cutters located on a bit are superimposed
        as if on a single cross-sectional portion of a bit body 301 or cutters 328
        of a bit such as bit 300. The cutter profiles of FIGS. 16 and 17 are illustrated
        as being to the right of longitudinal centerline L of a representative bit
        such as bit 300 instead of the left as illustrated in FIGS. 15A-15C. As described
        the leading end of bit 300 includes cone region 310 which includes cutters
        328C, nose region 312 which includes cutters 328N, flank region 314 which
        includes cutters 328F, shoulder region 316 which includes cutters 328S, and
        gage region 322 which includes cutters 328G wherein the cutters in each region
        may be referred to collectively as cutters 328. FIG. 16 illustrates a cutter
        profile exhibiting a high degree, or amount, of cutter overlap 356. That is,
        cutters 328 as illustrated in FIG. 17 are provided in sufficient quantity
        and are positioned sufficiently close to each other laterally, or radially,
        so as to provide a high degree of cutter redundancy as the bit rotates and
        engages the formation. In contrast, the representative cutter profile illustrated
        in FIG. 17 exhibits a relatively lower degree, or amount, of cutter overlap
        356. That is, the total number of cutters 328 is less in quantity and are
        spaced further apart with respect to the radial, or lateral, distance between
        individual, rotationally adjacent cutter profiles. Kerf regions 348, shown
        in phantom, in FIGS. 16 and 17 reveal a relatively small height for kerf regions
        348 of FIG. 16 wherein kerf regions of FIGS. 17 are significantly higher.
        To aid in the illustration of the respective differences in individual kerf
        region height K.sub.H, which, as a practical matter, is directly related to
        cutter exposure height H.sub.C, as well as individual kerf region widths K.sub.w
        which are directly influenced by the extent of radial overlap of cutters respectively
        positioned on different blades, a scaled reference grid of a plurality of
        parallel spaced lines is provided in FIGS. 16 and 17 to highlight the cutter
        exposure height and kerf region widths. The spacing between the grid lines
        in FIGS. 16 and 17 are scaled to represent approximately 0.125 of an inch.
        However, such a 0.125, or 1/8 inch, scale grid is merely exemplary, as dimensionally
        greater as well as dimensionally smaller cutter exposure heights, kerf region
        heights, and kerf region widths may be used in accordance with the present
        invention. The superimposed cutter profile of cutters 328 is illustrated with
        each of the represented cutters 328 being generally equidistantly spaced along
        the face of the bit from centerline L toward gage region 322; however, such
        need not be the case. For example, cutters 328C may have a cutter profile
        exhibiting more cutter overlap 356 resulting in a small kerf widths in cone
        region 310 as compared to a cutter profile of cutters 328N, 328F, and 328S
        respectively located in nose region 312, flank region 314, and shoulder region
        316 wherein such more radially outward positioned cutters would have less
        overlap resulting in larger kerf widths therein, or vice versa. Thus, by selectively
        incorporating the amount of cutter overlap 356 to be provided in each region
        of a bit, the depth of cut of the cutters in combination with selecting the
        degree or amount of cutter exposure height of each cutter located in each
        particular region may be utilized to specifically and precisely control the
        depth of cut in each region as well as to design into the bit the amount of
        available bearing surface surrounding the cutters to which the bit may ride
        upon the formation. Stated differently, the wider the kerf width K.sub.w between
        the collective, superimposed, individual cutter profiles of all the cutters
        on all of the blades, or alternatively all the cutters radially and circumferentially
        spaced about a bit, such as cutters 328 provided on a bit such as shown in
        FIG. 17, a greater proportion of the total applied WOB will be dispersed upon
        the formation allowing the bit to &quot;ride&quot; on the formation than would
        be the case if a greater quantity of cutters were provided having a smaller
        kerf width K.sub.w therebetween as shown in FIG. 16.<br />(41) Therefore,
        the cutter profile illustrated in FIG. 17 would result in a considerable portion
        of the WOB being applied to bit 300 to be dispersed over the wide kerfs and
        thereby allowing bit 300 to be supported by the formation as cutters 328 engage
        the formation. This feature of selecting both the total number of kerfs and
        the widths of the individual kerf widths K.sub.w allows for a precise control
        of the individual depth-of-cuts of the cutters adjacent the kerfs, as well
        as the total collective depth-of-cut of bit 300 into a formation of a given
        hardness. Upon a great enough, or amount of, WOB being applied on the bit
        when drilling in a given relatively hard formation the kerf regions 348 would
        come to ride upon the formation, thereby limiting, or arresting, the DOC of
        cutters 328. If yet further WOB were to be applied, the DOC would not increase
        as the kerf regions 348, as well as portions of the outwardly facing surface
        of the blade surrounding each cutter 328 provided with a reduced amount of
        exposure in accordance with the present invention, would, in combination,
        provide a total amount of bearing surface to support the bit in the relative
        hard formation, notwithstanding an excessive amount of WOB being applied to
        the bit in light of the current ROP.<br />(42) Contrastingly, in a bit provided
        with a cutter profile exhibiting dimensionally small cutter-to-cutter spacings
        by incorporating a relatively high quantity of cutters 328 with a small kerf
        region K.sub.w between mutually radially, or laterally, overlapped cutters
        such as illustrated in FIG. 16, each individual cutter would engage the formation
        with a lesser amount of DOC per cutter at a given WOB. Because each cutter
        would engage the formation at a lesser DOC as compared with the cutter profile
        of FIG. 17, with all other variables being held constant, the cutters of the
        cutter profile of FIG. 16 would tend to be better suited for engaging a relative
        hard formation where a large DOC is not needed, and is in fact not preferred,
        for engaging and cutting a hard formation efficiently. Upon a requisite, or
        excessive amount of WOB further being applied on a bit having the cutter profile
        of FIG. 16 in light of the current ROP being afforded by the bit, kerf regions
        348 would come to ride upon the formation, as well as other portions of the
        outwardly facing blade surface surround each cutter 328 exhibiting a reduced
        amount of exposure in accordance with the present invention to limit the DOC
        of each cutter by providing a total amount of bearing surface to disperse
        the WOB onto the formation being drilled. In general, larger kerfs will promote
        dynamic stability over formation cutting efficiency, while smaller kerfs will
        promote formation cutting efficiency over dynamic stability.<br />(43) Furthermore,
        the amount of cutter exposure that each cutter is designed to have will influence
        how quickly, or easily, the bearing surfaces will come into contact and ride
        upon the formation to axially disperse the WOB being applied to the bit. That
        is, a relatively small amount of cutter exposure will allow the surrounding
        bearing surface to come into contact with the formation at a lower WOB while
        a relatively greater amount of cutter exposure will delay the contact of the
        surrounding bearing surface with the formation until a higher WOB is applied
        to the bit. Thus, individual cutter exposures, as well as the mean kerf widths
        and kerf heights may be manipulated to control the DOC of not only each cutter,
        but the collective DOC per revolution of the entire bit as it rotatingly engages
        a formation of a given hardness and confining pressure at given WOB.<br />(44)
        Therefore, FIG. 16 illustrates an exemplary cutter profile particularly suitable
        for, but not limited to, a &quot;hard formation,&quot; while FIG. 17 illustrates
        an exemplary cutter profile particularly suitable for, but not limited to,
        a &quot;soft formation.&quot; Although the quantity of cutters provided on
        a bit will significantly influence the amount of kerf provided between radially
        adjacent cutters, it should be kept in mind that both the size, or diameter,
        of the cutting surfaces of the cutters may also be selected to alter the cutter
        profile to be more suitable for either a harder or softer formation. For example,
        cutters having larger diameter superabrasive tables may be utilized to provide
        a cutter profile including dimensionally larger kerf heights and dimensionally
        larger kerf widths to enhance soft formation cutting characteristics. Conversely,
        a bit may be provided with cutters having smaller diameter superabrasive tables
        to provide a cutter profile exhibiting dimensionally smaller kerf heights
        and dimensionally smaller kerf widths to enhance hard formation cutting characteristics
        of a bit in accordance with the teachings herein.<br />(45) Additionally,
        the full-gage diameter that a bit is to have will also influence the overall
        cutter profile of the bit with respect to kerf heights and kerf widths, as
        there will be a greater total amount of bearing surface potentially available
        to support larger diameter bits on a formation unless the bit is provided
        with a proportionately greater number of reduced exposure cutters and, if
        desired, conventional cutters, so as to effectively reduce the total amount
        of potential bearing surface area of the bit.<br />(46) FIG. 18A of the drawings
        is an isolated, schematic, frontal view of three representative cutters 328C
        positioned in cone region 310 of a representative blade structure 308. Each
        of the representative cutters exhibits a preselected amount of cutter exposure
        so as to limit the DOC of the cutters while also providing individual kerf
        regions 348 between cutters 328 (in this particular illustration, kerf width
        K.sub.w represents the kerf width between cutters which are located on the
        same blade and exhibit a selected radial spacing R.sub.s) and to which the
        bearing surface of the blade to which the cutters are secured (surface 320C)
        provides a bearing surface, including kerf regions 348 for the bit to ride,
        or rub, upon the formation, not currently being cut by this particular blade
        308, upon the design WOB being exceeded for a given ROP in a formation 350
        of certain hardness, or compressive strength. As can be seen in FIG. 18A,
        this particular view shows a rotationally leading blade surface 324 advancing
        toward the viewer and shows superabrasive cutting face or tables 330 of cutters
        328C engaging and creating a formation cutting, or chip, 350'' as the cutters
        engage the formation at a given DOC.<br />(47) FIG. 18B provides an isolated,
        side view of a representative reduced exposure cutter, such as cutter 328C
        located in cone region 310. Cutter 328C is shown as being secured in a blade
        308 at a preselected backrake angle .theta..sub.br and exhibits a selected
        exposed cutter height H.sub.c. As can be seen in FIG. 18B, cutter 328C is
        provided with an optional, peripherally extending chamfered region 321 exhibiting
        a preselected chamfer width C.sub.w. The arrow represents the intended direction
        of bit rotation when the bit in which the cutter is installed is placed in
        operation. A gap referenced as G.sub.1 can be seen rotationally rearwardly
        of cutter 328C. Cutter exposure height H.sub.c. allows a sufficient amount
        of cutter 328C to be exposed to allow cutter 328C to engage formation 350
        at a particular DOC1, which is well within the maximum DOC that cutter 328C
        is capable of engaging formation 350, to create a formation cutting 350''
        at this particular DOC1. Thus, in accordance with the present invention, the
        WOB now being applied to the bit in which cutter 328C is installed, is at
        a value less than the design WOB for the instant ROP and the compressive strength
        of formation 350.<br />(48) In contrast to FIG. 18B, FIG. 18C provides essentially
        the same side view of cutter 328C upon the design WOB for the bit being exceeded
        for the instant ROP and the compressive strength of formation 350. As can
        be seen in FIG. 18C, reduced exposure cutter 328C is now engaging formation
        350 at a DOC2 which happens to be the maximum DOC that this particular cutter
        328C should be allowed to cut. This is because formation 350 is now riding
        upon outwardly facing bearing surface 320C which generally surrounds the exposed
        portion of cutter 328C. That is, gap G.sub.2 is essentially nil in that surface
        320C and formation 350 are contacting each other and surface 320C is sliding
        upon formation 350 as the bit to which representative reduced exposure cutter
        320C is rotated in the direction of the reference arrow. Thus, especially
        in the absence of optional wear knots 334, DOC2 is essentially limited to
        the amount of cutter exposure height H.sub.c at the presently applied WOB
        in light of the compressive strength of the formation being engaged at the
        instant ROP. Even if the amount of WOB applied to the bit to which cutter
        328C is installed is increased further, DOC2 will not increase as bearing
        surface 320C, in addition to other face bearing surfaces 320 on the bit accommodating
        reduced exposure cutter 328, will prevent DOC2 from increasing beyond the
        maximum amount shown. Thus, bearing surface(s) 320C surrounding at least the
        exposed portion of cutter 328, taken collectively with other bearing surfaces,
        will prevent DOC2 from increasing dimensionally to an extent which could cause
        an unwanted, potentially bit damaging TOB being generated due to cutter 328
        overengaging formation 350. That is, a maximum-sized formation cutting 350&quot;
        associated with a reduced exposure cutter engaging the formation at a respective
        maximum DOC2, taken in combination with other reduced exposure cutters engaging
        the formation at a respective maximum DOC2, will not generate as taken in
        combination, a total, excessive amount of TOB which would stall the bit when
        the design WOB for the bit is met or exceeded for the particular compressive
        strength of the formation being engaged at the current ROP. Thus, the DOCC
        aspects of this particular embodiment is achieved by preferably ensuring that
        there is sufficient area surrounding each reduced exposure cutter 328, such
        as representative reduced exposure cutter 328C, so that not only is the DOC2
        for this particular cutter not exceeded, regardless of the WOB being applied,
        but preferably the DOC of a sufficient number of other cutters provided along
        the face of a bit encompassing the present invention is limited to an extent
        which prevents an unwanted, potentially damaging TOB from being generated.
        Therefore, it is not necessary that each and every cutter provided on a drill
        bit exhibit a reduced exposure cutter height so as to effectively limit the
        DOC of each and every cutter, but it is preferred that at least a sufficient
        quantity of cutters of the total quantity of cutters provided on a bit be
        provided with at least one of the DOCC features disclosed herein to preclude
        a bit, and the cutters thereon, from being exposed to a potentially damaging
        TOB in light of the ROP for the particular formation being drilled. For example,
        limiting the amount of cutter exposure of each cutter positioned in the cone
        region of a drill bit may be sufficient to prevent an unwanted amount of TOB
        should the WOB exceed the design WOB when drilling through a formation of
        a particular hardness at a particular ROP.<br />(49) FIGS. 19-22 are graphical
        portrayals of laboratory test results of four different bladed-style drill
        bits incorporating PDC cutters on the blades thereof Drill bits &quot;RE-S&quot;
        and &quot;RE-W&quot; each had selectively reduced cutter exposures in accordance
        with the present invention as previously described and illustrated in FIGS.
        14A-18C. However, bit &quot;RE-S&quot; was provided with a cutter profile
        exhibiting small kerfs and &quot;RE-W&quot; was provided with a cutter profile
        exhibiting wide kerfs. The bits having reduced exposure cutters are graphically
        contrasted with the laboratory test results of a prior art steerable bit &quot;STR&quot;
        featuring approximately 0.50 inch diameter cutters with each cutter including
        a superabrasive table having a peripheral edge chamfer exhibiting a width
        of approximately 0.050 inches and angled toward the longitudinal axis of the
        cutter by approximately 45.degree.. Conventional, or standard, general purpose
        drill bit &quot;STD&quot; featured approximately 0.50 inch diameter cutters
        backraked at approximately 20.degree. and exhibiting chamfers that were approximately
        0.016 inches in width and angled approximately 45.degree. with respect to
        the longitudinal axis of the cutter. All bits had a gage diameter of approximately
        12.25 inches and were rotated at 120 RPM during testing. With respect to all
        of the tested bits, the PDC cutters installed in the cone, nose, flank, and
        shoulder of the bits had cutter backrake angles of approximately 20.degree.0
        and the PDC cutters installed generally within the gage region had a cutter
        backrake angle of approximately 30.degree.. The cutter exposure heights of
        the RE-S and RE-W bits were approximately 0.120 inches for the cutters positioned
        in the cone region, approximately 0.150 inches in the nose region, approximately
        0.100 inches in the flank region, approximately 0.063 inches in the shoulder
        region, and the cutters in the gage region were generally ground flush with
        the gage for both of these bits embodying the present invention. The PDC cutters
        of the RE-S and RE-W bits were approximately 0.75 inches in diameter (with
        the exception of PDC cutters located in the gage region which were smaller
        diameter and ground flush with the gage) and were provided with a chamfer
        on the peripheral edge of the superabrasive cutting table of the cutter. The
        chamfers exhibited a width of approximately 0.019 inches and were angled toward
        the longitudinal axes of the cutters by approximately 45.degree.. The mean
        kerf width of the RE-S bit was approximately 0.3 of an inch and the mean kerf
        width of the RE-W bit was approximately 0.2 an inch.<br />(50) FIG. 19 depicts
        test results of Aggressiveness (.mu.) vs. DOC (in/rev)of the four different
        drill bits. Aggressiveness (.mu.), which is defined as Torque/(Bit Diameter.times.Thrust),
        can be expressed as:<br />(51) .mu.=36Torque (ft-lbs)/WOB(lbs).multidot.Bit
        Diameter(inches)<br />(52) The values of DOC depicted in FIG. 19 represent
        the DOC measured in inches of penetration per revolution that the test bits
        made in the test formation of Carthage limestone. The confining pressure of
        the formation in which the bits were tested was at atmospheric, or in other
        words 0 psig.<br />(53) Of significance is the encircled region &quot;D&quot;
        of the graph of FIG. 19. The plot of bit RE-S prior to encircled region D
        is very similar in slope to prior art steerable bit STR but upon the DOC reaching
        about 0.120 inches, the respective aggressiveness of the RE-S bit falls rather
        dramatically compared to the plot of the STR bit proximate and within encircled
        region D. This is attributable to the bearing surfaces of the RE-S bit taking
        on and axially dispersing the elevated WOB upon the formation axially underlying
        the bit associated with the larger DOCs, such as the DOCs exceeding approximately
        0.120 inches in accordance with the present invention.<br />(54) FIG. 20 graphically
        portrays the test results with respect to WOB in pounds versus ROP in feet
        per hour with a drill bit rotation of 120 revolutions per minute. Of general
        importance in the graph of FIG. 20 is that all of the plots tend to have the
        same flat curve as WOB and ROP increases indicating that at lower WOBs and
        lower ROPs of the RE-S and RE-W bits embodying the present invention exhibit
        generally the same behavior as the STR and STD bits. However, as WOB was increased,
        the RE-S bit in particular required an extremely high amount of WOB in order
        to increase the ROP for the bit due to the bearing surfaces of the bit taking
        on and dispersing the axial loading of the bit. This is evidenced by the plot
        of the reduced cutter exposure bit in the vicinity of region &quot;E&quot;
        of the graph exhibiting a dramatic upward slope. Thus, in order to increase
        the ROP of the subject inventive bit at ROP values exceeding about 75 ft/hr,
        a very significant increase of WOB was required for WOB values above approximately
        20,000 lbs as the load on the subject bit was successfully dispersed on the
        formation axially underlying the bit. The fact that a WOB of approximately
        40,000 lbs was applied without the RE-S bit stalling provides very strong
        evidence of the effectiveness of incorporating reduced exposure cutters to
        modulate and control TOB in accordance with the present invention as will
        become even more apparent in yet to be discussed FIG. 22.<br />(55) FIG. 21
        is a graphical portrayal of the test results in terms of TOB in the units
        of pounds-foot versus ROP in the units of feet per hour. As can be seen in
        the graph of FIG. 21 the various plots of the tested bits generally tracked
        the same, moderate and linear slope throughout the respective extent of each
        plot. Even in region &quot;F&quot; of the graph, where ROP was over 80 ft/hr,
        the TOB curve of the bit having reduced exposure cutters exhibited only slightly
        more TOB as compared to the prior art steerable and standard, general purpose
        bit notwithstanding the corresponding highly elevated WOB being applied to
        the subject inventive bit as shown in FIG. 20.<br />(56) FIG. 22 is a graphical
        portrayal of the test results in terms of TOB in the units of foot-pounds
        versus WOB in the units of pounds. Of particular significance with respect
        to the graphical data presented in FIG. 22 is that the STD bit provides a
        high degree of aggressivity at the expense of generating a relatively high
        amount of TOB at lower WOBs. Thus, if a generally non-steerable, standard
        bit were to suddenly &quot;break through&quot; a relative hard formation into
        a relatively soft formation, or if WOB were suddenly increased for some reason,
        the attendant high TOB generated by the highly aggressive nature of such a
        conventional bit would potentially stall and/or damage the bit.<br />(57)
        The representative prior art steerable bit generally has an efficient TOB/WOB
        slope at WOB''s below approximately 20,000 lbs but at WOBs exceeding approximately
        20,000 lbs, the attendant TOB is unacceptably high and could lead to unwanted
        bit stalling and/or damage. The RE-W bit incorporating the reduced exposure
        cutters in accordance with the present invention, which also incorporated
        a cutter profile having large kerf widths so that the onset of the bearing
        surfaces of the bit contacting the formation occurs at relatively low values
        of WOB. However, the bit having such an &quot;always rubbing the formation&quot;
        characteristic via the bearing surfaces, such as formation facing surfaces
        320 of blades 308 as previously discussed and illustrated herein, coming into
        contact and axially dispersing the applied WOB upon the formation at relatively
        low WOBs, may provide acceptable ROPs in soft formations, but such a bit would
        lack the amount of aggressivity needed to provide suitable ROPs in harder,
        firmer formations and thus could be generally considered to exhibit an inefficient
        TOB versus WOB curve.<br />(58) The representative RE-S bit incorporating
        reduced exposure cutters of the present invention and exhibiting relatively
        small kerf widths effectively delayed the bearing surfaces (for example, including
        but not limited to surface 320 of blades 308 as previously discussed and illustrated
        herein) surrounding the cutters from contacting the formation until relatively
        higher WOBs were applied to the bit. This particularly desirable characteristic
        is evidenced by the plot for the RE-S bit at WOB values greater than approximately
        20,000 lbs exhibits a relatively flat and linear slope as the WOB is approximately
        doubled to 40,000 lbs with the resulting TOB only increasing by about 25%
        from a value of about 3,250 ft-lbs to a value of approximately 4,500 ft-lbs.
        Thus, considering the entire plot for the subject inventive bit over the depicted
        range of WOB, the RE-S bit is aggressive enough to efficiently penetrate firmer
        formations at a relatively high ROP, but if WOB should be increased, such
        as by loss of control of the applied WOB, or upon breaking through from a
        hard formation into a softer formation, the bearing surfaces of the bit contact
        the formation in accordance with the present invention to limit the DOC of
        the bit as well as to modulate the resulting TOB so as to prevent stalling
        of the bit. Because stalling of the bit is prevented, the unwanted occurrence
        of losing tool face control or worse, damage to the bit is minimized if not
        entirely prevented in many situations.<br />(59) It can now be appreciated
        that the present invention is particularly suitable for applications involving
        extended reach or horizontal drilling where control of WOB becomes very problematic
        due to friction-induced drag on the bit, downhole motor if being utilized,
        and at least a portion of the drill string, particularly that portion of the
        drill string within the extended reach, or horizontal, section of the borehole
        being drilled. In the case of conventional, general purpose fixed cutter bits,
        or even when using prior art bits designed to have enhanced steerability,
        which exhibit high efficiency, that is, the ability to provide a high ROP
        at a relatively low WOB, the bit will be especially prone to large magnitudes
        of WOB fluctuation, which can vary from 10 to 20 klbs (10,000 to 20,000 pounds)
        or more, as the bit lurches forward after overcoming a particularly troublesome
        amount of frictional drag. The accompanying spikes in TOB resulting from the
        sudden increase in WOB may in many cases be enough to stall a downhole motor
        or damage a high efficient drill bit and or attached drill string when using
        a conventional drill string driven by a less sophisticated conventional drilling
        rig. If a bit exhibiting a low efficiency is used, that is, a bit that requires
        a relatively high WOB is applied to render a suitable ROP, the bit may not
        be able to provide a fast enough ROP when drilling harder, firmer formations.
        Therefore, when practicing the present invention of providing a bit having
        a limited amount of cutter exposure above the surrounding bearing surface
        of the bit and selecting a cutter profile which will provide a suitable kerf
        width and kerf height, a bit embodying the present invention will optimally
        have a high enough efficiency to drill hard formations at low depths-of-cut
        but exhibit a torque ceiling that will not be exceeded in soft formations
        when WOB surges.<br />(60) While the present invention has been described
        herein with respect to certain preferred embodiments, those of ordinary skill
        in the art will recognize and appreciate that it is not so limited and many
        additions, deletions, and modifications to the preferred embodiments may be
        made without departing from the scope of the invention as claimed. In addition,
        features from one embodiment may be combined with features of another embodiment
        while still being encompassed within the scope of the invention. Further,
        the invention has utility in both full bore bits and core bits, and with different
        and various bit profiles as well as cutter types, configurations and mounting
        approaches.","claimsHtml":"1. A drill bit for subterranean drilling, comprising:

        OF THE INVENTION<br />(2) 1. Field of the Invention<br />(3) The present invention
        relates to rotary drag bits for drilling subterranean formations and their
        operation. More specifically, the present invention relates to the design
        of such bits for optimum performance in the context of controlling cutter
        loading and depth-of-cut without generating an excessive amount of torque-on-bit
        should the weight-on-bit be increased to a level which exceeds the optimal
        weight-on-bit for the current rate-of-penetration of the bit.<br />(4) 2.
        State of the Art<br />(5) Rotary drag bits employing polycrystalline diamond
        compact (PDC) cutters have been employed for several decades. PDC cutters
        are typically comprised of a disc-shaped diamond &quot;table&quot; formed
        on and bonded under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions to a supporting
        substrate such as cemented tungsten carbide (WC), although other configurations
        are known. Bits carrying PDC cutters, which for example, may be brazed into
        pockets in the bit face, pockets in blades extending from the face, or mounted
        to studs inserted into the bit body, have proven very effective in achieving
        high rates of penetration (ROP) in drilling subterranean formations exhibiting
        low to medium compressive strengths. Recent improvements in the design of
        hydraulic flow regimes about the face of bits, cutter design, and drilling
        fluid formulation have reduced prior, notable tendencies of such bits to &quot;ball&quot;
        by increasing the volume of formation material which may be cut before exceeding
        the ability of the bit and its associated drilling fluid flow to clear the
        formation cuttings from the bit face.<br />(6) Even in view of such improvements,
        however, PDC cutters still suffer from what might simply be termed &quot;overloading&quot;
        even at low weight-on-bit (WOB) applied to the drill string to which the bit
        carrying such cutters is mounted, especially if aggressive cutting structures
        are employed. The relationship of torque to WOB may be employed as an indicator
        of aggressivity for cutters, so the higher the torque to WOB ratio, the more
        aggressive the cutter. This problem is particularly significant in low compressive
        strength formations where an unduly great depth of cut (DOC) may be achieved
        at extremely low WOB. The problem may also be aggravated by drill string bounce,
        wherein the elasticity of the drill string may cause erratic application of
        WOB to the drill bit, with consequent overloading. Moreover, operating PDC
        cutters at an excessively high DOC may generate more formation cuttings than
        can be consistently cleared from the bit face and back up the bore hole via
        the junk slots on the face of the bit by even the aforementioned improved,
        state-of-the-art bit hydraulics, leading to the aforementioned bit balling
        phenomenon.<br />(7) Another, separate problem involves drilling from a zone
        or stratum of higher formation compressive strength to a &quot;softer&quot;
        zone of lower strength. As the bit drills into the softer formation without
        changing the applied WOB (or before the WOB can be changed by the directional
        driller), the penetration of the PDC cutters, and thus the resulting torque
        on the bit (TOB), increase almost instantaneously and by a substantial magnitude.
        The abruptly higher torque, in turn, may cause damage to the cutters and/or
        the bit body itself. In directional drilling, such a change causes the tool
        face orientation of the directional (measuring-while-drilling, or MWD, or
        a steering tool) assembly to fluctuate, making it more difficult for the directional
        driller to follow the planned directional path for the bit. Thus, it may be
        necessary for the directional driller to back off the bit from the bottom
        of the borehole to reset or reorient the tool face. In addition, a downhole
        motor, such as drilling fluid-driven Moineau-type motors commonly employed
        in directional drilling operations in combination with a steerable bottomhole
        assembly, may completely stall under a sudden torque increase. That is, the
        bit may stop rotating thereby stopping the drilling operation and again necessitating
        backing off the bit from the borehole bottom to re-establish drilling fluid
        flow and motor output. Such interruptions in the drilling of a well can be
        time consuming and quite costly.<br />(8) Numerous attempts using varying
        approaches have been made over the years to protect the integrity of diamond
        cutters and their mounting structures and to limit cutter penetration into
        a formation being drilled. For example, from a period even before the advent
        of commercial use of PDC cutters, U.S. Pat. No. 3,709,308 discloses the use
        of trailing, round natural diamonds on the bit body to limit the penetration
        of cubic diamonds employed to cut a formation. U.S. Pat. No. 4,351,401 discloses
        the use of surface set natural diamonds at or near the gage of the bit as
        penetration limiters to control the depth-of-cut of PDC cutters on the bit
        face. The following other patents disclose the use of a variety of structures
        immediately trailing PDC cutters (with respect to the intended direction of
        bit rotation) to protect the cutters or their mounting structures: U.S. Pat.
        Nos. 4,889,017; 4,991,670; 5,244,039 and 5,303,785. U.S. Pat. No. 5,314,033
        discloses, inter alia, the use of cooperating positive and negative or neutral
        backrake cutters to limit penetration of the positive rake cutters into the
        formation. Another approach to limiting cutting element penetration is to
        employ structures or features on the bit body rotationally preceding (rather
        than trailing) PDC cutters, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,153,458; 4,554,986;
        5,199,511 and 5,595,252.<br />(9) In another context, that of so-called &quot;anti-whirl&quot;
        drilling structures, it has been asserted in U.S. Pat. No. 5,402,856 to one
        of the inventors herein that a bearing surface aligned with a resultant radial
        force generated by an anti-whirl underreamer should be sized so that force
        per area applied to the borehole sidewall will not exceed the compressive
        strength of the formation being underreamed. See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,982,802;
        5,010,789; 5,042,596; 5,111,892 and 5,131,478.<br />(10) While some of the
        foregoing patents recognize the desirability to limit cutter penetration,
        or DOC, or otherwise limit forces applied to a borehole surface, the disclosed
        approaches are somewhat generalized in nature and fail to accommodate or implement
        an engineered approach to achieving a target ROP in combination with more
        stable, predictable bit performance. Furthermore, the disclosed approaches
        do not provide a bit or method of drilling which is generally tolerant to
        being axially loaded with an amount of weight-on-bit over and in excess what
        would be optimum for the current rate-of-penetration for the particular formation
        being drilled and which would not generate high amounts of potentially bit-stopping
        or bit-damaging torque-on-bit should the bit nonetheless be subjected to such
        excessive amounts of weight-on-bit.<br />(11) BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br
        />(12) The present invention addresses the foregoing needs by providing a
        well-reasoned, easily implementable bit design particularly suitable for PDC
        cutter-bearing drag bits, which bit design may be tailored to specific formation
        compressive strengths or strength ranges to provide DOC control in terms of
        both maximum DOC and limitation of DOC variability. As a result, continuously
        achievable ROP may be optimized and torque controlled even under high WOB,
        while destructive loading of the PDC cutters is largely prevented.<br />(13)
        The bit design of the present invention employs depth of cut control (DOCC)
        features which reduce, or limit, the extent in which PDC cutters, or other
        types of cutters or cutting elements, are exposed on the bit face, on bladed
        structures, or as otherwise positioned on the bit. The DOCC features of the
        present invention provide substantial area on which the bit may ride while
        the PDC cutters of the bit are engaged with the formation to their design
        DOC, which may be defined as the distance the PDC cutters are effectively
        exposed below the DOCC features. Stated another way, the cutter standoff is
        substantially controlled by the effective amount of exposure of the cutters
        above the surface, or surfaces, surrounding each cutter. Thus, by constructing
        the bit so as to limit the exposure of at least some of the cutters on the
        bit, such limited exposure of the cutters in combination with the bit providing
        ample surface area to serve as a &quot;bearing surface&quot; in which the
        bit rides as the cutters engage the formation at their respective design DOC
        enables a relatively greater DOC (and thus ROP for a given bit rotational
        speed) than with a conventional bit design without the adverse consequences
        usually attendant thereto. Therefore the DOCC features of the present invention
        preclude a greater DOC than that designed for by distributing the load attributable
        to WOB over a sufficient surface area on the bit face, blades or other bit
        body structure contacting the formation face at the borehole bottom so that
        the compressive strength of the formation will not be exceeded by the DOCC
        features. As a result, the bit does not substantially indent, or fail, the
        formation rock.<br />(14) Stated another way, the present invention limits
        the unit volume of formation material (rock) removed per bit rotation to prevent
        the bit from over-cutting the formation material and balling the bit or damaging
        the cutters. If the bit is employed in a directional drilling operation, tool
        face loss or motor stalling is also avoided.<br />(15) In one embodiment,
        a rotary drag bit preferably includes a plurality of circumferentially spaced
        blade structures extending along the leading end or formation engaging portion
        of the bit generally from the cone region approximate the longitudinal axis,
        or centerline, of the bit, upwardly to the gage region, or maximum drill diameter
        of bit. The bit further includes a plurality of superabrasive cutting elements,
        or cutters such as PDC cutters, preferably disposed on radially outward facing
        surfaces of preferably each of the blade structures. In accordance with the
        DOCC aspect of the present invention, each cutter positioned in at least the
        cone region of the bit, e.g., those cutters which are most radially proximate
        the longitudinal centerline and thus are generally positioned radially inward
        of a shoulder portion of the bit, are disposed in their respective blade structures
        in such a manner that each of such cutters is exposed only to a limited extent
        above the radially outwardly facing surface of the blade structures in which
        the cutters are associatively disposed. That is, each of such cutters exhibit
        a limited amount of exposure generally perpendicular to the selected portion
        of the formation-facing surface in which the superabrasive cutter is secured
        to control the effective depth-of-cut of at least one superabrasive cutter
        into a formation when the bit is rotatingly engaging a formation such as during
        drilling. By so limiting the amount of exposure of such cutters by, for example,
        the cutters being secured within and substantially encompassed by cutter-receiving
        pockets, or cavities, the DOC of such cutters into the formation is effectively
        and individually controlled. Thus, regardless of the amount of WOB placed,
        or applied, on the bit, even if the WOB exceeds what would be considered an
        optimum amount for the hardness of the formation being drilled and the ROP
        in which the drill bit is currently providing, the resulting torque, or TOB,
        will be controlled or modulated. Thus, because such cutters have a reduced
        amount of exposure above the respective formation-facing surface in which
        it is installed, especially as compared to prior art cutter installation arrangements,
        the resultant TOB generated by the bit will be limited to a maximum, acceptable
        value. This beneficial result is attributable to the DOCC features, or characteristic,
        of the present invention effectively preventing at least a sufficient number
        of the total number of cutters from over-engaging the formation and potentially
        causing the rotation of the bit to slow or stall due to an unacceptably high
        amount of torque being generated. Furthermore, the DOCC features of the present
        invention are essentially unaffected by excessive amounts of WOB, as there
        will preferably be a sufficient amount or size of bearing surface area devoid
        of cutters on at least the leading end of the bit in which the bit may &quot;ride&quot;
        upon the formation to inhibit or prevent a torque-induced bit stall from occurring.<br
        />(16) Optionally, bits employing the DOCC aspects of the present invention
        may have reduced exposure cutters positioned radially more distant than those
        cutters proximate to the longitudinal centerline of the bit such as in the
        cone region. To elaborate, cutters having reduced exposure may be positioned
        in other regions of a drill bit embodying the DOCC aspects of the present
        invention. For example, reduced exposure cutters positioned on the comparatively
        more radially distant nose, shoulder, flank, and gage portions of a drill
        bit will exhibit a limited amount of cutter exposure generally perpendicular
        to the selected portion of the radially outwardly facing surface to which
        each of the reduced exposure cutters are respectively secured. Thus, the surfaces
        carrying and proximately surrounding each of the additional reduced exposure
        cutters will be available to contribute to the total combined bearing surface
        area on which the bit will be able to ride upon the formation as the respective
        maximum depth-of-cut for each additional reduced exposure cutter is achieved
        depending upon the instant WOB and the hardness of the formation being drilled.<br
        />(17) By providing DOCC features having a cumulative surface area sufficient
        to support a given WOB on a given rock formation preferably without substantial
        indentation or failure of same, WOB may be dramatically increased, if desired,
        over that usable in drilling with conventional bits without the PDC cutters
        experiencing any additional effective WOB after the DOCC features are in full
        contact with the formation. Thus, the PDC cutters are protected from damage
        and, equally significant, the PDC cutters are prevented from engaging the
        formation to a greater depth of cut and consequently generating excessive
        torque which might stall a motor or cause loss of tool face orientation.<br
        />(18) The ability to dramatically increase WOB without adversely affecting
        the PDC cutters also permits the use of WOB substantially above and beyond
        the magnitude applicable without the adverse effects associated with conventional
        bits to maintain the bit in contact with the formation, reduce vibration and
        enhance the consistency and depth of cutter engagement with the formation.
        In addition, drill string vibration as well as dynamic axial effects, commonly
        termed &quot;bounce,&quot; of the drill string under applied torque and WOB
        may be damped so as to maintain the design DOC for the PDC cutters. Again,
        in the context of directional drilling, this capability ensures maintenance
        of tool face and stall-free operation of an associated downhole motor driving
        the bit.<br />(19) It is specifically contemplated that the DOCC features
        according to the present invention may be applied to coring bits as well as
        full bore drill bits. As used herein, the term &quot;bit&quot; encompasses
        core bits and other special purpose bits. Such usage may be, by way of example
        only, particularly beneficial when coring from a floating drilling rig, or
        platform, where WOB is difficult to control because of surface water wave-action-induced
        rig heave. When using the present invention, a WOB in excess of that normally
        required for coring may be applied to the drill string to keep the core bit
        on bottom and maintain core integrity and orientation.<br />(20) It is also
        specifically contemplated that the DOCC attributes of the present invention
        have particular utility in controlling, and specifically reducing, torque
        required to rotate rotary drag bits as WOB is increased. While relative torque
        may be reduced in comparison to that required by conventional bits for a given
        WOB by employing the DOCC features at any radius or radii range from the bit
        centerline, variation in placement of DOCC features with respect to the bit
        centerline may be a useful technique for further limiting torque since the
        axial loading on the bit from applied WOB is more heavily emphasized toward
        the centerline and the frictional component of the torque is related to such
        axial loading. Accordingly, the present invention optionally includes providing
        a bit in which the extent of exposure of the cutters vary with respect to
        the cutters respective positions on the face of the bit. As an example, one
        or more of the cutters positioned in the cone, or the region of the bit proximate
        the centerline of the bit, are exposed to a first extent, or amount, to provide
        a first DOC and one or more cutters positioned in the more radially distant
        nose and shoulder regions of the bit are exposed at a second extent, or amount,
        to provide a second DOC. Thus, a specifically engineered DOC profile may be
        incorporated into the design of a bit embodying the present invention to customize,
        or tailor, the bit''s operational characteristics in order to achieve a maximum
        ROP while minimizing and/or modulating the TOB at the current WOB, even if
        the WOB is higher than what would otherwise be desired for the ROP and the
        specific hardness of the formation then being drilled.<br />(21) Furthermore,
        bits embodying the present invention may include blade structures in which
        the extent of exposure of each cutter positioned on each blade structure has
        a particular and optionally individually unique DOC, as well as individually
        selected and possibly unique effective backrake angles, thus resulting in
        each blade of the bit having a preselected DOC cross-sectional profile as
        taken longitudinally parallel to the centerline of the bit and taken radially
        to the outermost gage portion of each blade. Moreover, a bit incorporating
        the DOCC features of the present invention need not have cutters installed
        on, or carried by, blade structures, as cutters having a limited amount of
        exposure perpendicular to the exterior of the bit in which each cutter is
        disposed may be incorporated on regions of bits in which no blade structures
        are present. That is, bits incorporating the present invention may be completely
        devoid of blade structures entirely, such as, for example, a coring bit.<br
        />(22) A method of constructing a drill bit in accordance with the present
        invention is additionally disclosed herein. The method includes providing
        at least a portion of the drill bit with at least one cutting element-accommodating
        pocket, or cavity, on a surface which will ultimately face and engage a formation
        upon the drill bit being placed in operation. The method of constructing a
        bit for drilling subterranean formations includes disposing within at least
        one cutter-receiving pocket a cutter exhibiting a limited amount of exposure
        perpendicular to the formation-facing surface proximate the cutter upon the
        cutter being secured therein. Optionally, the formation-facing surface may
        be built up by a hard facing, a weld, a weldment, or other material being
        disposed upon the surface surrounding the cutter so as to provide a bearing
        surface of a sufficient size while also limiting the amount of cutter exposure
        within a preselected range to effectively control the depth of cut that the
        cutter may achieve upon a certain WOB being exceeded and/or upon a formation
        of a particular compressive strength being encountered.<br />(23) A yet further
        option is to provide wear knots, or structures, formed of a suitable material
        which extend outwardly and generally perpendicularly from the face of the
        bit in general proximity of at least one or more of the reduced exposure cutters.
        Such wear knots may be positioned rotationally behind, or trailing, each provided
        reduced exposure cutter so as to augment the DOCC aspects provided by the
        bearing surface respectively carrying and proximately surrounding a significant
        portion of each reduced exposure cutter. Thus, the optional wear knots, or
        wear bosses, provide a bearing surface area in which the drill bit may ride
        on the formation upon the maximum DOC of that cutter being obtained for the
        present formation hardness and then current WOB. Such wear knots, or bosses,
        may comprise hard facing material, structure provided when casting or molding
        the bit body or, in the case of steel-bodied bits, may comprise weldments,
        structures secured to the bit body by methods known within the art of subterranean
        drill bit construction, or by surface welds in the shape of one or more weld-beads
        or other configurations or geometries.<br />(24) A method of drilling a subterranean
        formation is further disclosed. The method for drilling includes engaging
        a formation with at least one cutter and preferably a plurality of cutters
        in which one or more of the cutters each exhibit a limited amount of exposure
        perpendicular to a surface in which each cutter is secured. In one embodiment,
        several of the plurality of limited exposure cutters are positioned on a formation-facing
        surface of at least one portion, or region, of at least one blade structure
        to render a cutter spacing and cutter exposure profile for that blade and
        preferably for a plurality of blades that will enable the bit to engage the
        formation within a wide range of WOB without generating an excessive amount
        of TOB, even at elevated WOBs, for the instant ROP in which the bit is providing.
        The method further includes an alternative embodiment in which the drilling
        is conducted with primarily only the reduced exposure cutters engaging a relatively
        hard formation within a selected range of WOB and upon a softer formation
        being encountered and/or an increased amount of WOB being applied, at least
        one bearing surface surrounding at least one reduced, or limited, exposure
        cutter, and preferably a plurality of sufficiently sized bearing surfaces
        respectively surrounding a plurality of reduced exposure cutters, contacts
        the formation and thus limits the DOC of each reduced, or limited, exposure
        cutter while allowing the bit to ride on the bearing surface, or bearing surfaces,
        against the formation regardless of the WOB being applied to the bit and without
        generating an unacceptably high, potentially bit damaging TOB for the current
        ROP.","backgroundTextHtml":null,"subHeadingM0Html":null,"subHeadingM1Html":null,"subHeadingM2Html":null,"subHeadingM3Html":null,"subHeadingM4Html":null,"subHeadingM5Html":null,"subHeadingM6Html":null,"usClassIssued":"175/57","issuedUsDigestRefClassifi":null,"datePublYear":"2002","applicationYear":"2000","pfDerwentWeekYear":null,"pfApplicationYear":null,"pfPublYear":null,"reissueApplNumber":null,"abstractHeader":null,"abstractedPublicationDerwent":null,"affidavit130BFlag":null,"affidavit130BText":null,"applicantGroup":null,"applicantHeader":null,"applicationFilingDateInt":20001215,"applicationFilingDateIntKwicHits":null,"applicationRefFilingType":null,"applicationReferenceGroup":null,"applicationSeriesAndNumber":null,"applicationSeriesCode":"09","assignee1":null,"assigneeDescriptiveText":["N/A"],"patentAssigneeTerms":null,"associateAttorneyName":null,"attorneyName":null,"biologicalDepositInformation":null,"applicationType":null,"unlinkedDerwentRegistryNumber":null,"unlinkedRingIndexNumbersRarerFragments":null,"claimStatement":"What
