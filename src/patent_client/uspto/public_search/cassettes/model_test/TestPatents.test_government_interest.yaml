        adapter of the invention provides more uniform straightened air flow, directing
        contaminated air toward a catalytic monolith module inserted in the adapter.
        The adapter may be made from stainless steel, carbon steel, or other metals
        or alloys resistant to degradation in the environment of a burner, such as
        austenitic nickel-chromium-based alloys (e.g., Inconel\xAE). The adapter supports
        the flow straightening element a distance upstream from the monolith inlet
        surface to permit flow straightening before the air enters the monolith. The
        flow straightening element may be a perforated plate constructed from any
        of a variety of temperature and corrosion resistant materials, such as those
        of the adapter itself. Additionally, the adapter is not part of the monolith
        module itself, so the adapter may be reused when an old or exhausted catalytic
        monolith module is changed out.<br />(10) Catalytic monoliths may be made
        from a variety of materials. In some embodiments, an extruded ceramic catalytic
        monolith is constructed from ceramic monolith substrate material, such as
        cordierite. The ceramic monolith substrate material is extruded, to produce
        an extruded ceramic monolith. Catalytically active material is then applied
        to the monolith to produce a catalytic monolith. In other embodiments, a metal
        foil catalytic monolith is constructed from metal foil monolith substrate,
        such as corrugated metal foil. The metal foil monolith substrate has catalytically
        active material applied and may then be wound, folded, or otherwise configured
        to produce the metal foil catalytic monolith.<br />(11) The catalytically
        active materials applied to either extruded ceramic or metal foil monolith
        substrates are typically catalytically active noble metals such as platinum,
        palladium, ruthenium, rhodium, gold, or any other highly active noble metal
        catalysts, and combinations thereof. To apply such catalysts to the monolith
        substrate materials, the catalysts are generally dispersed on high surface
        area oxides such as alumina, silica, zirconia, titania, ceria, and the like,
        or any combination thereof, and washcoated onto the monolith substrate.<br
        />(12) The adapters and devices of the invention beneficially permit the use
        of catalytic monolith modules which are easily handled using gloved hands,
        and can be used in a system incorporated in a space-constrained environment,
        such as a submarine's Mark V or other CO\u2014H.sub.2 burner. The invention
        thus reduces necessary labor, reduces variability, lowers the production of
        dust when loading the catalyst into the submarine burner, and minimizes health
        risks to sailors. The adapters and devices of the invention also facilitate
        catalytic monolith modules to be produced more economically with simple rectangular
        dimensions because the flow straightener elements and supporting tabs are
        included on the adapter.<br />(13) With reference to the Figures, <figref
        idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows one embodiment of an adapter
        <b>1</b> of the invention. The flow in a Mark V CO\u2014H.sub.2 burner toward
        the adapter is downward, and the flow straightener element in this case is
        mounted on the top face of the adapter <b>1</b>. The flow straightener element
        has a perforated plate <b>7</b> with a mesh screen <b>6</b> placed over the
        left hand portion of the perforated plate <b>7</b> as shown in face-on view
        in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. While embodiments
        of the invention are described herein with reference to left and right sides
        or portions, those of skill in the art will readily appreciate that adapters
        may be constructed with the opposite orientation, depending on the orientation
        of the burner and baffle <b>15</b> where the adapter will be placed. A metal
        tab <b>8</b> extends along the sides of the adapter <b>1</b> so that the adapter
        <b>1</b> slides into the catalyst tray of the CO\u2014H.sub.2 burner. The
        adapter <b>1</b> is supported by the catalyst tray tab supports <b>17</b>
        which are part of the burner, as shown in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIGS.
        <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>. The front face <b>2</b> of the adapter <b>1</b>
        is open to allow one or multiple catalytic monolith modules <b>11</b> to slide
        into the adapter <b>1</b>. A catalytic monolith module <b>11</b> may be installed
        into the adapter <b>1</b> before or after the adapter <b>1</b> is slid into
        the CO\u2014H.sub.2 burner. The side faces <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> and back face
        <b>3</b> of the adapter are closed. The bottom of the adapter is open except
        for a lip <b>9</b> (typically about one inch) around the perimeter to support
        the catalytic monolith module or modules within the adapter <b>1</b>. Additional
        support lips may be provided on the adapter in some embodiments, such as where
        individual monoliths are used instead of a monolith module <b>11</b>.<br />(14)
        <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a catalytic monolith
        module <b>11</b> containing a matrix array of individual catalytic monoliths
        <b>12</b> with interstitial filler <b>13</b> between the monoliths. Such interstitial
        filler <b>13</b> preferably prevents air flowing through the interstitial
        spaces between the individual monoliths <b>12</b> in the monolith module <b>11</b>,
        and may be made from ceramic blanket insulating material such as Fiberfrax\xAE
        or the like. In other embodiments the monolith module <b>11</b> may be constructed
        from a single full size monolith catalyst <b>12</b> which occupies essentially
        all the area of the module, or other combinations of multiple smaller monoliths
        <b>12</b>. The monoliths <b>12</b> themselves may be sized such that an integral
        number fits into the adapter <b>1</b>, or fractional sized monoliths may be
        used in order to fill the catalytic monolith module.<br />(15) A catalytic
        monolith module <b>11</b> designed for use in the Mark V CO\u2014H.sub.2 burner,
        for example, may have a metallic frame <b>14</b> with outside dimensions of
        32 inches long by 22\xBD inches wide by 4\u215C inches deep. Such a monolith
        module <b>11</b> may accommodate an array of individual catalytic monoliths.
        For example, monoliths <b>12</b> each of which measure 6 inches long by 6
        inches wide by 3.5 inches deep (e.g., in an array of 5 monoliths in the length
        direction by 3\xBD monoliths in the width direction) with interstitial filler
        <b>13</b> in the form of blanket material separating the monoliths <b>12</b>.
        Such a module <b>11</b> fits into an adapter slightly larger in length and
        width, such as 32\xBC inches long by 22 11/16 inches wide by 4 15/16 inches
        deep, which itself would fit in the catalyst chamber of the burner. The adapter
        thus takes the place of the catalyst drawer in the catalyst chamber. As discussed
        below, the adapter is deeper than the monoliths themselves in order to preserve
        a gap <b>16</b> between the upper surface of the monoliths and the flow straightener.
        Those of skill in the art will appreciate that the dimensions of the adapter
        and the module may be varied depending on the application, thus, other sizes
        may be constructed for use in other burners.<br />(16) When multiple modules
        are used, a high temperature fabric or blanket material (such as the material
        used for interstitial filler <b>13</b> which separate individual monoliths
        within a module) may be placed between the modules to prevent air flow between
        the modules. For example, three catalytic monolith modules with outside dimensions
        of 32 inches long by 7\xBD inches wide by 4\u215C inches deep could be placed
        in the adapter and used in the Mark V CO\u2014H.sub.2 burner. Alternatively,
        three catalytic monolith modules with dimensions 10\u2154 inches long by 22\xBD
        inches wide by 4\u215C inches deep may be placed in the adapter for use in
        a Mark V CO\u2014H.sub.2 burner. Such an alternative embodiment may be preferred
        on a submarine where storage of full length monolith modules may be undesirable.
        Each assembled monolith module may optionally have a retainer screen designed
        to secure and constrain the monolith or monolith blocks within the monolith
        module. For example, the retainer screen in some embodiments is a heavy gauge
        stainless steel wire retainer screen with 7/16 inch square openings secured
        at the upstream surface and/or downstream surfaces of the monoliths. Other
        optional retention means will be appreciated by those of skill in the art.<br
        />(17) <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a frontal
        view of a monolith module <b>11</b> placed in the adapter <b>1</b>. The adapter
        <b>1</b> maintains a gap <b>16</b> (typically about one inch) between the
        top surface of the monolith(s) themselves and the perforated plate <b>7</b>
        or other flow straightener. This gap <b>16</b> is provided to allow dissipation
        of the turbulence that is created in the air as it travels through the holes
        in the perforated plate <b>7</b>, providing a more uniform air flow to the
        catalytic monoliths. The gap is generally larger than the diameter of the
        holes in the perforated plate <b>7</b>, preferably at least six times the
        diameter of the largest holes. The monolith module <b>11</b> is supported
        by the lip <b>9</b> that extends inside the bottom perimeter of the adapter.
        The tabs <b>8</b> on the side of the adapter <b>1</b> support the adapter
        <b>1</b> when it is installed in the burner, sliding along and ultimately
        resting upon the tab supports <b>17</b> inside the burner catalyst chamber.<br
        />(18) <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a face-on
        view of one embodiment of a flow straightener of the invention, one having
        a perforated plate <b>7</b> and a mesh screen <b>6</b>. The flow straightener
        is designed to promote more uniform air flow to the catalytic monolith. Without
        a flow straightener, air flow emerging from the baffle of the burner is biased
        toward the near side of the monolith, while the far side receives little air
        flow. The flow straightener provides for more even air flow and air pressure
        reaching the monolith, improving performance, efficiency, and life span of
        the catalytic monolith.<br />(19) The particular specifications for the perforated
        plate (e.g., the diameter of the holes) and screen (e.g., the kind and other
        parameters) can be adjusted to straighten the air flow for any specific application.
        In some embodiments, the perforated plate <b>7</b> is about 0.05 inches thick,
        substantially the same length and width as the adapter, and is sufficiently
        rigid to be supported solely by the upper lip around the perimeter of the
        upper portion of the adapter. The perforated plate <b>7</b> is provided with
        holes allowing air to flow through toward the monolith module(s). In some
        embodiments, the perforated plate has 3/32 inch diameter holes in a 3/16 inch
        staggered center pattern.<br />(20) In some embodiments, the flow straightener
        has a stainless steel mesh screen <b>6</b>, such as a 200 mesh screen with
        openings of about 0.002 inch, which screen covers a portion of one side of
        the perforated plate. For example, the mesh screen <b>6</b> may cover about
        six inches of the left side of the perforated plate <b>7</b>. The mesh screen
        <b>6</b> imposes a restriction on the air flow flux through the perforated
        plate <b>7</b> on the side of the perforated plate <b>7</b> closest to the
        air flow's emergence from the baffle of the burner, thereby providing more
        uniform air flow to the entirety of the catalytic monolith.<br />(21) In other
        embodiments, the flow straightener's perforated plate <b>7</b> has holes in
        a graduated pattern from smallest on the side nearest the baffle to largest
        on the side furthest from the baffle. Such a perforated plate functions as
        a flow straightener without the need for a mesh screen <b>6</b> to restrict
        the flow on the baffle side. Instead, the smaller holes on the baffle side
        together with progressively larger holes on the distal side promote the desired
        uniformity of air flow. As those of skill in the art will appreciate, the
        flow straightener perforated plate may be constructed with a variety of hole
        patterns, both in the size of the holes and their placement, in order to accomplish
        more uniform straightened air flow in a particular burner.<br />(22) <figref
        idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows the air flow path in a
        Mark V CO\u2014H.sub.2 burner. This burner was designed for a fixed bed catalyst
        such as Hopcalite\xAE type catalysts. After passing over the heater (not shown),
        the contaminated air travels upward within a narrow duct along the right hand
        side and over a baffle from the right hand side to the left before making
        a sharp turn downward to the catalyst chamber <b>18</b>. The direction of
        air flow upstream from the catalyst chamber on the left hand side is predominately
        downward with a high velocity. The velocity of the air flow nearer the right
        hand side is much lower and less directed downward. Such a velocity profile
        is not suitable for a channeled monolith because air cannot travel from left
        to right within the monolith. The flow at the left side would be much higher
        than on the right side and such conditions would result in an overall diminished
        performance. Also, the top right hand side within the channels would tend
        to wear because it is the point where the air must suddenly alter paths from
        a slanted or angled downward direction to a straight downward direction. The
        tab supports <b>17</b> for the catalyst drawer are shown and allow the drawer
        to slide in and out.<br />(23) <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>
        shows an embodiment of the adapter inserted into the Mark V CO\u2014H.sub.2
        burner with a catalytic monolith module <b>11</b> installed. The perforated
        plate <b>7</b> and screen <b>6</b> are supported about one inch above the
        monolith module <b>11</b>. The tab supports <b>17</b> that support the adapter
        (via the tabs <b>8</b>) in the burner also prevent flow bypassing along the
        sides of the adapter. The air flow is straightened above the monolith module
        <b>11</b> and travels uniformly through the monolith catalyst therein.<br
        />(24) In some embodiments of the invention, the adapter <b>1</b> and perforated
        plate <b>7</b> as well as the frame <b>14</b> of the catalyst module <b>11</b>
        are constructed from stainless steel, Inconel\xAE, Incoloy\xAE, or the like.
        In other embodiments these components can be constructed from other metals
        or alloys that are resistant to degradation in the chemical and thermal environment
        present in the burner. The frame <b>14</b> of the module <b>11</b> protects
        the fragile catalytic monoliths from damage. The monolith module <b>11</b>
        fits into the adapter <b>1</b>, which is then inserted directly into the burner,
        resting on the supporting tabs <b>17</b> of the burner. A catalyst tray or
        drawer designed to hold the disadvantageous granular catalyst is not needed.<br
        />(25) The adapter can easily accommodate both metal foil catalytic monoliths
        and extruded ceramic catalytic monoliths. Extruded ceramic catalytic monoliths
        are suitable for submarine application because they tend to be resistant to
        acid gases that may form from the undesired oxidation of compounds such as
        halogenated VOC. Typical extruded ceramic catalytic monoliths have channel
        densities (sometimes referred to as cell densities) ranging from 100 to 600
        channels (or cells) per square inch. Depending on the application, extruded
        ceramic catalytic monoliths for the invention will have at least 50, preferably
        100, more preferably 400 or more channels per square inch. In one preferred
        embodiment for submarine CO\u2014H.sub.2 burners, the monoliths have a cell
        density of at least 400 channels per square inch. The geometric surface area
        and void fraction of a 400 channels per square inch monolith are approximately
        64 cm.sup.2/cm.sup.3 and 0.64, respectively.<br />(26) In other embodiments,
        metal foil catalytic monoliths are also suitable for submarine applications.
        One advantage provided by such monoliths is that they can easily be constructed
        to most desirable dimensions. For example, a monolith module having a single
        metal foil catalytic monolith within can be made having dimensions of 32 inches
        long by 22\xBD inches wide by 4\u215C inches deep, which would therefore fit
        in an adapter designed for the Mark V CO\u2014H.sub.2 burner. By contrast,
        extruded ceramic catalytic monoliths having channel densities in the range
        of 400 channels per square inch are usually limited in size to 6 inch by 6
        inch blocks, so that multiple monoliths and fractions thereof are needed to
        complete a monolith module.<br />(27) Typically, a metal foil catalytic monolith
        is designed to provide an \u201Ceffective\u201D channel density greater than
        50, preferably greater than 100, more preferably greater than 150 channels
        per square inch. The channel density for metal foil catalytic monoliths is
        referred to as \u201Ceffective\u201D because unlike the extrusion process
        for extruded ceramic monoliths, a metal foil catalytic monolith may be constructed
        by spiral winding of metal foil, or alternatively by folding metal foil, typically
        corrugated metal foil, to create the channels. In one preferred catalytic
        monolith for submarine CO\u2014H.sub.2 burners, the metal foil catalytic monolith
        has an effective channel density of at least 150 channels per square inch.
        The geometric surface area and void fraction of a monolith with an effective
        channel density of 185 channels per square inch made from corrugated foils
        in a herringbone pattern that are then folded to make layers is approximately
        20 cm.sup.2/cm.sup.3 and 0.84, respectively.<br />(28) The adapter containing
        a catalytic monolith module is oriented to accommodate the direction of air
        flow of the burner in which it will be used. For the Mark V CO\u2014H.sub.2
        burner, for example, the air flow is downward (as shown in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIGS.
        <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>). Alternatively, in the Mark IV CO\u2014H.sub.2
        burner the air flow is horizontal, and the adapter of the invention would
        simply be suitably oriented.<br />(29) The following Example serves to illustrate
        the present invention and are not intended to limit its scope in any way.<br
        />EXAMPLES<br />Example 1\u2014an Adapter for a Monolith Catalyst Module for
        Use in a Mark V CO\u2014H.SUB.2 .Burner<br />(30) An adapter of the invention
        was constructed from \u215B inch carbon steel sheet metal, with outside dimensions
        of 32\xBC inches long by 22 11/16 inches wide by 4 15/16 inches deep. In order
        to simplify construction, the sheet metal was cut to the necessary dimensions
        and folded to make 90 degree angles to provide 1 inch lips on the top and
        bottom. The pieces were then welded along mitered corners to produce the complete
        rectangular structure. The device was equipped with an air flow straightener
        having an Incoloy\xAE 625 perforated plate with 3/32 inch diameter holes in
        a 3/16 inch staggered centers pattern, with an open area of about 50%. The
        perforated plate was 0.05 inches thick, substantially the same length and
        width as the adapter (32\xBC inches long by 22 11/16 inches) and was sufficiently
        rigid to be supported solely by a 1 inch lip along the perimeter of the top
        of the adapter. The flow straightener was constructed with a 200 mesh stainless
        steel screen with openings of about 0.002 inch, which screen covered 6 inches
        of the left hand side of the perforated plate. The tabs were also made from
        \u215B inch thick carbon steel sheet metal and were welded to extend outward
        from the sides of the adapter by \xBC inch. The tabs were 1\u215C inches from
        the bottom of the adapter to ensure proper placement in the catalytic chamber.<br
        />(31) A catalytic monolith module was constructed with a stainless steel
        frame which measured 32 inches long by 22\xBC inches wide by 4 inches deep.
        Individual extruded ceramic monolith blocks were constructed from cordierite,
        and were 6 inches square by 3\xBD inches deep, with a channel density of 400
        channels per square inch. The catalytically active noble metal platinum was
        dispersed on a zirconia high surface area oxide support, which was then washcoated
        onto the extruded ceramic monoliths. The washcoated monolith blocks, now catalytically
        active extruded ceramic catalytic monoliths, were then arranged in the monolith
        module. High temperature ceramic insulation (Fiberfrax\xAE) was used to seal
        between the monolith blocks to prevent air flow bypassing the monoliths. A
        heavy gauge stainless steel wire retainer screen with 7/16 inch square openings
        was used to secure and constrain the monolith blocks within the monolith module
        at both the upstream and downstream surfaces of the monoliths in the catalytic
        monolith module.<br />(32) <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>
        shows a comparison of the velocity profiles in the catalyst chamber when the
        adapter is not in place, with an adapter in place having a flow straightener
        in the form of a uniform perforated plate <b>7</b>, and with an adapter in
        place having a flow straightener in the form of a uniform perforated plate
        <b>7</b> and a screen <b>6</b> on the left hand side. Severe non-uniform flow
        distribution is indicated by the high flow velocity on the left hand side
        when the adapter is not in place. The adapter using only the perforated plate
        <b>7</b> lowers the non-uniformity on the left side. The adapter with both
        the perforated plate <b>7</b> and screen <b>6</b> shows the lowest velocity
        on the left hand side. The average velocities for these three scenarios are
        490, 305, and 240 feet per minute, respectively.<br />(33) <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG.
        <b>8</b></figref> shows a comparison of the local flow velocity to the average
        flow velocity for the three scenarios discussed above. The values were calculated
        by dividing the velocity measured at each point by the average velocity of
        all points. The case without the adapter shows severe velocity variation with
        the velocity on the left side being approximately 3.0 to 3.5 times higher
        than the average velocity and lower than average velocities on the right hand
        side. When the adapter and perforated plate are used, the velocity at the
        left hand side is between 2.0 to 3.0 times higher than the average velocity.
        The velocity toward the right hand is predominately lower than the average
        velocity. Adding the screen to the perforated plate produces the most uniform
        velocity profile. On the left hand side, the velocity ranges from about 1.5
        to 2.0 times higher than the average and the ratio towards the right side
        is nearly 1.0. The perforated plate straightens the incoming air flow, helps
        reduce wear on the right hand side of the monolith channels, and is less prone
        to wear than the ceramic monolith substrate material because it is made from
        metal. Monolith ceramic, as well as the washcoat adhered to either ceramic
        or a metallic monolith, are relatively soft compared to the perforated plate.
        In this Example using a perforated plate with uniform size holes, flattening
        the velocity profile sufficiently to enable efficient use of the catalytic
        monoliths was assisted by the addition of a mesh screen. The combination of
        the perforated plate and mesh screen produced a flow straightening element
        that is sufficient to allow the catalytic monoliths to be used efficiently.<br
        />(34) The adapter of Example 1 is well suited to accommodating catalytic
        monolith modules, whether metal or ceramic, for use in a variety of catalytic
        converters, such as a Mark V CO\u2014H.sub.2 burner. For other burners with
        different dimensions, such as the Mark IV CO\u2014H.sub.2 burner, suitable
        modifications to the dimensions of the adapter and catalytic monolith modules
        used therein may be made.<br />(35) The present invention is not to be limited
        in scope by the specific embodiments described above, which are intended as
        illustrations of aspects of the invention. Although the invention has been
        described in detail with particular reference to such embodiments, other embodiments

        OF THE INVENTION<br />(1) The invention is related to the field of air purification
        systems using catalytic converters, more particularly to adapting catalytic
        converters designed for use with a fixed bed catalyst for modular use of catalytic
        monoliths.<br />BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br />(2) Life support systems
        are required on submarines, space vehicles, and other closed air environments
        where human occupancy is necessary for extended periods of time, and such
        systems operate by controlling the temperature, barometric pressure, and composition
        of the enclosed air. Temperature and barometric pressure are controlled by
        air conditioning and nitrogen reservoir systems, respectively, while the composition
        of the environment is controlled by oxygen generation (or replenishment),
        carbon dioxide removal, and other systems designed to remove contaminants
        that are generated or released by personnel, equipment, and materials into
        the closed environment. On a submarine, these contaminates include carbon
        monoxide, hydrogen, volatile organic compounds (VOC), halogenated VOC, and
        particulate material, which would adversely affect the sailors if they were
        not continuously removed. Techniques used to control the amounts of contaminants
        in the breathing air onboard closed air environments such as on a submarine
        include absorbents for selected contaminants, filters for particulates, restrictions
        on materials and activities permitted on board the submarine, and engineered
        systems.<br />(3) Engineered systems for contaminant removal include, among
        others, catalytic converters. A type of catalytic converter known as a burner
        heats contaminated air, exposes the heated air to a catalyst which removes
        contaminants, and thereby produces purified air. One such system that removes
        carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen (H.sub.2), and many VOCs from the air on a
        submarine is the Carbon Monoxide-Hydrogen (CO\u2014H.sub.2) burner, which
        is based on catalytic oxidation at elevated temperature. Air enters the CO\u2014H.sub.2
        burner through a particulate filter and is passed through a heat exchanger
        before being heated further and then passed through an oxidation catalyst
        bed. One commonly used catalyst is a mixture of copper oxide and manganese
        dioxide (known as a Hopcalite\xAE type catalyst) which operates by chemically
        converting harmful contaminants to other chemical compounds which are less
        hazardous and/or which can be removed from the submarine by other systems.
        From the catalyst bed, the treated air flows again though the heat exchanger,
        where a majority of the heat is transferred to the incoming air, and then
        to a cooling coil. An after-filter consisting of a granular basic material
        (e.g., lithium carbonate) is placed downstream from the cooling coil to capture
        acidic compounds that may form over the catalyst.<br />(4) Gravimetrically,
        Hopcalite\xAE type catalysts have relatively low activity and their use therefore
        requires a large mass of catalyst to perform the necessary chemical conversions.
        Hopcalite\xAE type catalysts are also granular and have to be manually poured
        or scooped into the catalyst tray or drawer within the catalyst chamber. When
        the Hopcalite\xAE type catalyst is handled in this fashion, it creates a significant
        amount of toxic and irritating dust in the air. Consequently, operators are
        required to wear respirators, chemical protective gloves, and goggles for
        protection and other personnel are required to leave the immediate vicinity.
        Hopcalite\xAE type catalysts are also hazardous materials, and the spent catalyst
        must be treated as a hazardous waste.<br />(5) When loading the granular catalyst
        into the catalyst drawer, it is often difficult to achieve a uniform void
        fraction throughout the bed, and particularly at the edges of the drawer.
        Areas of a higher void fraction offer lower resistance to air flowing through
        the bed and cause flow non-uniformity, known as channeling. Channeling is
        analogous to flow that is bypassing the bed, reducing the overall effectiveness
        of the catalyst because contaminants are not chemically converted unless they
        contact the catalyst surface. Even if a uniform void fraction were achieved
        during the loading process, non-uniformities in the void fraction can develop
        over time due to catalyst settling, attrition, and thermal cycling when the
        burner is started up and shut down, which may lead to fracturing of the catalyst
        granules and dust formation. This problem can be severe for fixed bed catalysts
        operating with air flowing in a non-downward direction. These problems with
        fixed bed catalysts are well known to those skilled in the art.<br />(6) The
        catalyst industry has developed catalytic monoliths to address certain problems
        associated with fixed beds. Monoliths are structures that provide high geometric
        surface area to support the catalytically active ingredients while eliminating
        dust and attrition and presenting a low pressure drop for the flowing air.
        Monoliths are widely used in automotive catalytic converters and stationary
        emission control applications. The monoliths are manually placed into a catalyst
        drawer as one would arrange blocks or bricks in a single layer to fill the
        drawer. A gravimetrically highly active catalyst is required to use a monolith,
        however, because the geometric surface area of a monolith is usually lower
        than that of a fixed bed of granular material. Hopcalite\xAE type catalysts
        are generally not used in monolithic form because of their low gravimetric
        activity.<br />(7) One disadvantage of placing multiple smaller catalytic
        monoliths in a catalyst drawer is that after placing them into position, some
        monoliths may have to be manually cut or carved for placement around the peripheral
        dimensions of the catalyst chamber. However, most catalyst chambers are designed
        to be rectangular, and one or multiple monoliths are commonly installed into
        a metallic frame that approximates the catalyst chamber dimensions.<br />(8)
        Poor air flow distribution, that is, non-uniform flow, upstream from the monolith
        will not self-correct as it travels through the structure. Regions with higher
        air flow are characterized by reduced catalyst contact time and concomitantly
        lower conversion of contaminants. This problem is less severe for fixed or
        packed beds where readily free and extensive radial flow in all directions
        promotes mixing and cross-flow of incoming air and promotes a more uniform
        velocity profile throughout the catalyst bed when channeling is not present.
        Monoliths, however, generally provide at best a limited ability for cross-flow
        of incoming air and have a limited ability to promote flattening of the velocity
        profile therein. Extruded ceramic monoliths may be made from a variety of
        ceramic materials such as cordierite and the like. Such extruded ceramic monoliths
        with channels therethrough prevent all air flow from one channel to another,
        allowing radial dispersion only within each individual channel (and thereby
        access to the catalytic inner surface of the channel) as the air flows through
        the channels from the upstream inlet entry surface to the downstream outlet
        exit surface. Use of an extruded ceramic catalytic monolith thus requires
        more uniform incoming air flow in order to spread the mass of the air to all
        the channels and to the full surface area of the catalyst in the channels.<br
        />(9) Metal foil monoliths may be constructed in a variety of configurations.
        See generally Gulian et al., Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., vol. 30, no. 1 (1991).
        Some such configurations, such as wound corrugated metal foil monoliths, provide
        channels passing through the monolith allowing no cross-flow and mixing between
        channels. In such a design, the wound metal foil monolith behaves similarly
        to an extruded ceramic monolith, in that the air flow entering each channel
        is restricted to passage only through that same channel. Other configurations,
        such as folded layered metal foil monolith structures, may provide at least
        some cross-flow and mixing between channels in designs in which the folding
        creates interconnections between the channels. Such configurations allow air
        entering one channel to disperse to one or more adjacent channels, but such
        dispersion is generally far less than in a fixed bed system. Because non-uniform
        flow distribution through the monolithic structure lowers the overall effectiveness
        of the system, effective monolithic catalyst systems would be improved by
        providing a uniform air flow upstream from the monolith.<br />(10) Methods
        of achieving more uniform air flow are well known to those skilled in monolith
        system design and typically include providing long and straight ducting upstream
        from the monolith for air self-straightening, flow straighteners, installing
        air expansion zones, and/or installing screens. Straight ducting and expansion
        zones are preferred in certain applications, particularly those that have
        sufficient physical space, because they introduce the least turbulence and
        back pressure. Maintaining lower turbulence and lower back pressure are particularly
        important in, for example, automotive and pollution control applications,
        in order to achieve optimum performance and efficiency, and may also reduce
        system noise where such noise reduction is desirable. Flow straighteners using
        perforated plates or screens are not well suited in such applications because
        they generally increase back pressure.<br />(11) Catalytic burners onboard
        US submarines are designed to fit in highly constrained tight spaces and do
        not have sufficient space for long straight lengths of ducting or expansion
        zones. Additionally, the space constraints on submarines contribute to more
        severe non-uniform air flow distribution upstream from the catalyst chamber.
        This flow non-uniformity would reduce the effectiveness of a catalytic monolith
        used in a submarine CO\u2014H.sub.2 burner designed for a fixed bed catalyst.<br
        />(12) The art is in need of improved devices and methods enabling the use
        of catalytic monoliths in catalytic converters otherwise designed for use
        with a fixed bed catalyst.<br />SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br />(13) Having
        observed the aforementioned problems, the inventors hereof have invented improved
        devices and methods for adapting catalytic converters to use catalytic monoliths
        where space is restricted and not amenable to the use of long straight ducting,
        expansion zones, and other flow straightening means requiring more space.<br
        />(14) The invention contemplates use of adapters in systems for catalytic
        treatment of a variety of contaminated gases. While the term \u201Cair\u201D
        is used herein, those of skill in the art will appreciate that the adapter
        of the invention is equally useful in such systems for treatment of gases
        other than air. The invention is useful in a wide variety of catalytic converters
        where it would be desirable to use catalytic monoliths, such as in submarine
        burners designed to purify air where space limitations have posed obstacles
        to using catalytic monoliths. Additionally, for example, the invention is
        useful in catalytic converters designed to control NOx (nitric oxide and nitrogen
        dioxide) or VOC emissions from stationary sources such as coal or oil fired
        power plants where the use of catalytic monoliths assists in compliance with
        emissions requirements, but where space may also be limited. While the monolith
        materials and catalysts may differ for different applications, the adapter
        of the invention is applicable both to burners and to other catalytic converters
        such as NOx converters capable of catalytically converting NOx to N.sub.2.<br
        />(15) The invention provides an adapter that enables a catalytic monolith
        module to be used in a system that was designed for a fixed bed catalyst in
        space-limited environments, such as a submarine CO\u2014H.sub.2 burner. The
        adapter device is made to slide into the catalyst chamber of the burner (in
        place of a catalyst drawer containing granular catalyst) and supports an air
        flow straightener element upstream from one or multiple catalytic monolith
        modules which slide into the adapter. The adapter's outer dimensions in length
        and width are substantially the same as the drawer, although the adapter's
        height may differ in some embodiments. The dimensions of the adapter are specified
        to fit in an existing catalytic converter's catalyst chamber, such as in a
        submarine burner, like a Mark V CO\u2014H.sub.2 burner, and the adapter can
        be oriented in either a horizontal or vertical direction to accommodate the
        air flow in different burner models.<br />(16) A catalytic monolith module
        consisting of only bare catalytic monoliths can be used, but housings or frames
        that contain one or more catalytic monoliths may be preferred in some applications
        to avoid cracking or fracturing the catalytic monoliths. The monolithic modules
        of the invention contemplate both bare catalytic monoliths and those housed
        in frames, which are generally constructed from metal or other materials resistant
        to the environment in the catalytic chamber of a burner.<br />(17) In some
        embodiments, the flow straightener element can consist of a perforated plate
        or multiple layers of a perforated plate at specific locations. Alternatively,
        the flow straightener element may consist of a woven screen or multiple layers
        of a woven screen at specific locations. The perforations and screens may
        be uniform or non-uniform. The flow straightener could also consist of a combination
        of perforated plates and screens in specific areas. For monoliths used in
        systems originally designed for fixed beds, perforated plates and screens
        are particularly advantageous because the added pressure drop at least partially
        compensates for the lower pressure drop of monoliths as compared to fixed
        beds.<br />(18) The adapter may be made from rigid materials such as stainless
        steel or other metals or alloys resistant to corrosion, oxidation, and carbonization
        at high temperatures, such as austenitic nickel-chromium-based alloys (e.g.,
        Inconel\xAE, Incoloy\xAE, and the like). The adapter supports the flow straightener
        at a distance upstream from the monolith to permit flow straightening before
        the air enters the monolith. The adapter is not part of the catalytic monolith
        module itself, so the adapter may be reused when an old or exhausted catalytic
        monolithic module is changed out.<br />(19) The adapters and devices of the
        invention beneficially permit the use of catalytic monolith modules which
        are easily handled using gloved hands, and can be used in a system incorporated
        in a space-constrained environment, such as a submarine burner. The invention
        thus reduces necessary labor, reduces variability, lowers the production of
        dust when loading the catalyst into the submarine CO\u2014H.sub.2 burner,
        and minimizes health risks to sailors. The adapters and devices of the invention
        also permit catalytic monolithic modules to be produced more economically
        with simple rectangular dimensions because the flow straightener elements
        and supporting tabs are included on the adapter.<br />(20) The adapter is
        particularly suitable for monoliths containing catalysts such as platinum,
        palladium, ruthenium, rhodium, gold or any other highly active noble metal
        catalysts that are easily applied both to extruded ceramic monolith substrates
        to produce catalytic monoliths, and to metallic monolith substrates made from
        metal foils which are then configured by winding or folding into catalytic
        monoliths. The catalytically active metals are typically dispersed on high
        surface area oxides such as alumina, silica, zirconia, titania, ceria, and
        the like, or any combination thereof, and washcoated onto the monolith substrate.
        Alternatively, and particularly for NOx converters, the catalyst may be co-extruded
        with other materials to form the catalytic monolith. For example, catalytic
        monoliths suitable for use in NOx converters may be constructed from vanadium
        oxide, tungsten oxide, titanium oxide, and other materials. Such catalytic
        monoliths are prepared without needing washcoating because the catalyst is
        part of the monolith as extruded.<br />(21) In one aspect, the invention provides
        an adapter for accommodating a catalytic monolith module (referred to herein
        alternatively as a monolith module) in a catalytic converter with a catalytic
        chamber, having a rigid frame with an open front face, and an air flow straightener
        having a perforated plate. The adapter's open front face allows insertion
        of the catalytic monolith module. In another aspect, the air flow straightener
        has a mesh screen. In another aspect, the adapter also has tabs extending
        longitudinally along its right and left faces to be supported by tab supports
        in the catalyst chamber of the catalytic converter. The adapter may also have
        a lip on its bottom for retaining the catalytic monolith module. The catalytic
        converter may be a burner, such as a CO\u2014H.sub.2 burner. One such CO\u2014H.sub.2
        burner used by the Navy on submarines is the Mark V CO\u2014H.sub.2 burner.<br
        />(22) In one aspect, the invention provides an aforementioned adapter with
        an inserted catalytic monolith module. The catalytic monolith module has at
        least one catalytic monolith such as an extruded ceramic catalytic monolith
        or a metal foil catalytic monolith. A catalytically active noble metal is
        dispersed on a high surface area oxide support and washcoated onto the monolith
        substrate. In an embodiment using extruded ceramic substrate, the extrusion
        produces an extruded ceramic monolith, to which the catalyst is then applied.
        In an embodiment using metal foil substrate, the catalyst is preferably applied
        prior to folding or winding the metal foil into a monolith. In both such embodiments,
        a catalytic monolith is produced.<br />(23) The noble metal may be selected
        from platinum, palladium, ruthenium, rhodium, and gold, or any mixture of
        these. The oxide may be selected from alumina, silica, zirconia, titania,
        and ceria, or any mixture of these. In some aspects, the catalytic monolith
        is an extruded ceramic catalytic monolith with a cell density typically at
        least 400 cells per square inch. The catalytic monolith module may have a
        plurality of extruded ceramic catalytic monoliths, in which case such monoliths
        may be separated by individual supporting brackets and/or interstitial filler.
        In other aspects, the catalytic monolith is a metal foil catalytic monolith
        with an effective cell density typically at least 150 channels per square
        inch. In some aspects, the catalytic monolith module has a frame, which may
        be metal or other durable materials sufficient to support the monoliths in
        the monolith module.<br />(24) In some aspects, the catalytic monolith module
        has at least one retainer screen, at or near the inlet (upstream) and/or outlet
        (downstream) surfaces of the catalytic monoliths, to retain the catalytic
        monoliths therein. In particular aspects used in a submarine, the dimensions
        of the adapter are about 32\xBC inches long, 22 11/16 inches wide, and 4 15/16
        inches deep and the dimensions of the module's metal frame are slightly less
        than those of the adapter such that the monolith module fits within the adapter.
        The catalytic monolith module may be a fractional size such that an integral
        number of monolith modules fit within the adapter. Where multiple monolith
        modules are used in a single adapter, the monolith modules may be separated
        by interstitial filler. Such adapters would be suitable for use in a Mark
        V CO\u2014H.sub.2 burner or other burners having catalyst chambers with similar
        dimensions. Those of skill in the art will appreciate that the adapter of
        the invention may be used in applications which were designed for use with
        fixed bed catalysts other than burners. The adapter with catalytic monolith
        module allows for replacement of the fixed bed catalyst in a variety of catalytic
        converters where contaminated gas is directed to the catalyst, thereby conferring
        the advantages of monolithic catalysts and simple modular replacements.<br
        />(25) In one aspect, the invention provides a method of adapting a catalytic
        converter designed for use with a fixed bed catalyst drawer (such as a Mark
        V CO\u2014H.sub.2 burner) to be used with a catalytic monolith, by substituting
        an aforementioned adapter in place of the fixed bed catalyst drawer, and inserting
        a catalytic monolith module in the adapter. In another aspect, the adapter
        is reusable, by simply removing an exhausted catalytic monolith module from
        the adapter and inserting a replacement. In another aspect, the catalytic
        converter is a CO\u2014H.sub.2 burner.<br />(26) These and other aspects of
        the invention will be readily appreciated by those of skill in the art from
