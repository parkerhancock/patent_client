        BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS<br />(2)  In the following
        drawings, which form a part of the specification and which are to be construed
        in conjunction therewith, and in which like reference numerals have been employed
        throughout wherever possible to indicate like parts in the various views:<br
        />(3)  FIG. 1 is a schematic view of a recharging system in accordance with
        an exemplary embodiment of the invention; and,<br />(4)  FIG. 2 is a partially
        fragmented perspective view of a recharging tank showing several tennis balls
        being recharged therein.<br />(5) DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br
        />(6)  As shown in FIG. 1 of the drawings, one exemplary embodiment of the
        present invention is generally designated by reference numeral 20. The present
        invention employs a cylindrical pressure vessel 22 with an internal charging
        chamber 24 that is essentially impermeable when sealed.<br />(7)  The chamber
        24 is formed from the hollow vessel interior bounded between a closed end
        26 and a spaced apart removable end 27 with a wall 28 extending therebetween.
        The removable end 27 may include the entire cylinder end or a portion thereof.
        A charging port 29 penetrates vessel 22 proximate removable end 28. The charging
        port 29 permits the entry and removal of gasses from chamber 24. A pressure
        gauge may penetrate vessel 22 adjacent port 29 or alternatively a removable
        pressure gauge may be placed on port 29 during tennis ball charging to thereby
        measure the internal pressure in chamber 24.<br />(8)  The invention may include
        a series of storage vessels 23 that are virtually identical to pressure vessel
        22. The storage vessels may be appropriately plumbed to reuse gas released
        from the charging vessel 22 or they may be supplied with gas separately as
        appropriate. Such storage vessels may be used to store recharged tennis balls
        at 17 psi indefinitely.<br />(9)  Of particular relevance to the present invention
        is Dalton''s law. It says the total pressure of a gas is equal to the sum
        of the partial pressures of each of the component gases: P.sub.total=P.sub.1+P.sub.2+P.sub.3
        . . . +P.sub.n  If we consider air, this means the total atmospheric pressure
        of 1.013 bars (14.7 pounds per square inch absolute) is the sum of the partial
        pressures of all its constituents: nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor, argon, carbon
        dioxide, and various other gases in trace amounts. In particular, air contains
        roughly 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.93% argon, 0.04% carbon dioxide, and trace
        amounts of other gases, in addition to variable quantities of water vapor,
        which normally approximates 3%. The two most dominant components in dry air
        are Oxygen and Nitrogen. Oxygen has an 16 atomic unit mass and Nitrogen has
        a 14 atomic units mass. Since both these elements are diatomic in air --O.sub.2
        and N.sub.2, the molecular mass of Oxygen is 32 and the molecular mass of
        Nitrogen is 28. Since air is a mixture of gases the total mass can be estimated
        by adding the weight of all major components as shown below:<br />(10)   TABLE-US-00001

        />(11)  Water vapor--H.sub.2O--is composed of one Oxygen atom and two Hydrogen
        atoms. Hydrogen is the lightest element at 1 atomic unit while Oxygen is 16
        atomic units. Thus the water vapor atom has an atomic mass of 18 atomic units.
        At 18 atomic units, water vapor is lighter than diatomic Oxygen with 32 units
        and diatomic Nitrogen with 28 units. Thus, it is important to note that water
        vapor in air will replace other gases and reduce the total density of the
        mixture and hence dry air is more dense than humid air. Carbon dioxide (CO.sub.2)
        on the other hand has a atomic mass of 44.01, which is more dense than dry
        air at 28.97.<br />(12)  In the charging container 22, carbon dioxide is kept
        at 50 psi during charging. The introduction of multiple depleted tennis balls
        42 introduces a quantity of air at atmospheric pressure (i.e. air at approximately
        14.7 psi). The total quantity is dependent upon the number of tennis balls
        introduced but can be expected to be the number of tennis balls multiplied
        by the internal volume of each ball, which can be calculated based upon the
        formula: sphere volume= 4/3.pi.r.sup.3=(.pi.d.sup.3)/6. The acceptable measurements
        for the external diameter of tennis balls according to the International Tennis
        Federation is 2.575 inches to 2.700 inches with the outer covering and internal
        rubber core having a thickness of approximated 0.125 inches. Thus, the appropriate
        diameter is approximately 2.5 inches and the internal volume of each ball
        is approximately 8.17 cubic inches. Fifty such balls would have an internal
        volume of 408.5 cubic inches. The charging chamber volume is much larger.<br
        />(13)  The volume of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula: Volume=.pi.r.sup.2height=1/4.pi.d.sup.2height.
        In one exemplary embodiment, the charging chamber 24 has a radius of approximately
        4-6 inches and a height of approximately 2.5-3.0 feet (i.e. 30 inches). Thus,
        the volume of the charging chamber would be approximately 3391 cubic inches.
        Such a charging chamber can hold 50 or more tennis balls.<br />(14)  Introducing
        50 flat tennis balls 32 at atmospheric pressure into the charging chamber
        does not change the pressure or gas concentrations inside the chamber, which
        is already at ambient room conditions. After the balls are added, the pressure
        in the charging chamber 25 is increased to 50 psi by introducing an appropriate
        quantity of pressurized carbon dioxide, generally in the range of 1-5 pounds
        of materials. The added carbon dioxide initially fills the charging chamber
        24, increasing the pressure throughout the charging container. Each of the
        tennis balls 30 acts as a small pressure vessel with permeable walls that
        the pressurized carbon dioxide gas must permeate over time. The internal pressure
        of each tennis ball is initially at 14.7 psi (i.e. 1 atm) but over time the
        pressurized carbon dioxide at 50 psi will penetrate the tennis ball exterior
        32 as well as the semi-permeable rubber core or internal wall 34 and begin
        equalizing the internal tennis ball pressure with the chamber internal pressure.
        As the tennis ball pressure increases, the chamber pressure decreases accordingly.
        After approximately 4 days, the internal tennis ball pressures will have risen
        to 17 psi while the chamber pressure will have decreased from 50 to 47 psi.
        Thus it is possible to monitor the status of the charging tennis balls by
        monitoring the decreasing pressure of the charging chamber 30 to determine
        when the balls are recharged.<br />(15)  It has been found that the number
        of tennis balls being recharged is not especially important in that 3 balls
        can be recharged in essentially the same time frame as 30 balls. However,
        increasing the internal pressure of the recharging chamber from 50 to 60 psi
        did decrease the recharging time from 4 days to 3 days.<br />(16)  The steps
        for implementing the present invention include the following. The chamber
        24 is emptied and open and at ambient atmospheric condition. Several depleted
        tennis balls (i.e. up to around 50) are then introduced into the chamber 24
        through the opened removable end 28. End 28 is then sealed. A gas preferably
        heavier in molecular weight than air and most preferentially carbon dioxide
        is introduced into the chamber 24 through port 29. As additional gas is introduced,
        the pressure inside chamber 24 rises above 14 psi and then above 17 psi. While
        feasible to operate at lower pressures, it has been determined through experimentation
        that practicable time periods (i.e. less than 10 days) requires a chamber
        pressure of at least 40 psi and more preferentially 50 psi. Once the pressure
        chamber 24 is charged to 50 psi, the chamber may be agitated to jostle the
        balls 32 inside the chamber. This prevents balls from becoming misshapen as
        a result of being lodged or otherwise captivated against a wall or the like.
        The chamber pressure is monitored with a pressure gauge, which may be a permanent
        part of the vessel 22 or used with port 29. As the chamber pressure decreases,
        the pressure inside the balls will increase correspondingly. Once a desirable
        pressure decrease has occurred (i.e. 3 psi drop) a corresponding pressure
        increase in the balls will occur as well. Thus, once the chamber pressure
        drops 3 psi the internal ball pressure will have risen from 14 to 17 psi and
        the balls will be sufficiently recharged to terminate the recharging process.
        The pressure in chamber 22 is then bleed off through port 29 until at an acceptable
        level (i.e. 17 psi for storage and 14 psi to open the chamber).<br />(17)  From

        />(9) BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br />(10)  1. Field of the Invention<br
        />(11)  The present invention relates to the field of recharging depleted
        or exhausted or dead or depressurized tennis balls. In particular, the present
        invention relates specifically to an apparatus and method for recharging depleted
        or exhausted or dead or depressurized tennis balls to restore the liveliness
        and optimum configuration of the individual balls. Known art may be found
        in U.S. Class 206, subclass 213.1 as well as in other classes and subclasses.<br
        />(12)  2. Description of the Known Art<br />(13)  Many games use a gas pressurized
        hollow ball during play (i.e. football, basketball, soccer, tennis, etc.).
        In the game of tennis, the ball is spherical and of a standard diameter and
        it is covered with a fibrous nap. Important parameters of the tennis ball
        are its bounce or liveliness or resiliency and this is a function of the ball''s
        internal gas pressure, its size and spherical configuration and the condition
        of the fibrous nap. All of these parameters should be maintained constant
        and uniform from ball to ball and during the useful life of the ball. Since
        the reaction of the ball to the impact of the racket and its ground rebound
        characteristics are functions of the above parameters, any significant change
        or variation thereof adversely affects the proper playing of the game.<br
        />(14)  As is well known, the resiliency exhibited by tennis balls is due,
        at least in part, to the pressurization of the tennis balls during manufacturing.
        To be suitable for tournament play, tennis balls must be able to meet quite
        rigid specifications regarding their size, the distance to which they rebound
        when dropped from a standard height, the amount of deformation they exhibit
        under an applied standard force, and their surface characteristics. All manufacturers
        strive to comply with these rigid specifications to insure that the balls
        they manufacture exhibit the uniformity demanded by serious amateur as well
        as professional tennis competitors.<br />(15)  Tennis balls are generally
        packaged and marketed in pressurized hermetically sealed containers so as
        to minimize or prevent any diffusion outwardly of the pressurized gas in the
        ball which would reduce its liveliness and so as to obviate any distortion
        of the ball from its standard size or shape as a consequence of the ball''s
        high internal pressure. A basic problem with tennis balls presently in use
        is that, as the balls age, they lose pressure. This pressure loss results
        from the diffusion through the tennis ball surface of whatever gas may be
        used to inflate tennis balls during manufacture. Partially to combat this
        loss of pressure, tennis balls have, for some time, been marketed in pressurized
        canisters, generally three tennis balls to a canister. Of course, once the
        canister in which the tennis balls have been sold is opened, the tennis balls
        are removed from their pressurized environment and, as a result of the pressure
        differential across their surfaces, they begin to be deflated and the distortion
        of the ball commences so that the ball is thereafter of limited useful life
        in the proper playing of tennis.<br />(16)  As stated previously, with usage
        and/or the passage of time, the internal pressurization of tennis balls eventually
        escapes until the internal pressure of the tennis balls drops to atmospheric
        pressure. At that time, the unpressurized and depleted tennis balls are considered
        to be dead or flat even though their the tennis balls may otherwise be acceptable.
        Depleted tennis balls are typically discarded. While many of the tennis balls
        may be retired because their surfaces have become worn beyond acceptable limits,
        many more tennis balls are retired simply because they have lost their pressurization.
        Discarding depleted but otherwise acceptable tennis balls can be extremely
        wasteful, particularly at large clubs such as tennis clubs and country clubs
        where the quantity of depleted tennis balls can be high.<br />(17)  Others
        have proposed solutions to deal with depleted tennis balls, including recharging
        and/or recycling apparatus and methods. Patents disclosing information relevant

        Pressurizer shows another needle-like device for repressurizing a tennis ball.
        This patent discusses a tennis ball pressurizer having a source of pressurized
        gas, a regulating valve for controllably releasing the gas and a hollow needle
        for injecting the gas into the ball. The needle has an internal bevel at one
        end which cuts a plug from the wall of the ball. The plug seats into the needle
        and is partially exposed beyond the end of the needle. Gas is released from
        the pressure source and passes through the needle to enter into the ball through
        a side vent in the needle. As the needle is withdrawn from the ball after
        it is repressurized, the plug engages in and seals the puncture hole.<br />(27)  Many
        of the preceding devices are either complex and inconvenient to employ or
        they have been unsatisfactory in that they tended to damage the surface of
        the ball, thereby adversely affecting the ball''s playing properties and otherwise
        left much to be desired.<br />(28)  Another significant drawback of the prior
        art is that such prior art contemplates pressurization of a very small number
        of tennis balls, typically, three tennis balls in a container of a configuration
        similar to the containers in which tennis balls are marketed.<br />(29)  The
        increasing popularity of tennis and the resultant growth in the offering of
        group tennis lessons, as well as the burgeoning tennis club industry, have
        resulted in the use of far more tennis balls than such prior art apparatus
        can economically preserve. For example, it is not uncommon for a tennis club
        in a large metropolitan area to use 10,000 or more tennis balls in a year.
        To address the large quantities of balls, some have proposed &quot;batch&quot;
        systems. &quot;Batch&quot; processing of tennis balls can be a real and immediate
        solution that may result in significant economy, particularly for users of
        large numbers of tennis balls. As used by many, batch processing refers to
        the processing of, for example, 200 or more tennis balls at one time.<br />(30)  For
        example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,101,029 issued to Feinberg et al. on Jul. 18, 1978,
        entitled Tennis Ball Rejuvenator and Maintainer shows pressure vessel for
        batch processing tennis balls. This patent discusses a pressure vessel for
        storing tennis balls includes a cylindrical open topped receptacle having
        in its inside upper border a peripheral groove separably engaging an elastomeric
        O-ring gasket provided with a finger removal tab. A vertical coaxial post
        is anchored to the receptacle base and axially movably supports for movement
        between limited raised and depressed positions a coupling member which is
        spring urged to raised position and releasably locked in its depressed position.
        A dished cover is coaxially separably connected to the coupling member and
        has an outwardly downwardly inclined peripheral lip engaging the O-ring when
        the cover is in raised position to effect an air tight seal. Mounted on the
        receptacle peripheral wall and communicating with the interior thereof are
        a pressure gauge, a pressure release and safety valve and a pressurizing check
        valve.<br />(31)  U.S. Pat. No. 4,046,491 issued to Roeder on Sep. 6, 1977,
        entitled Tennis Ball Preserver shows a large container for batch processing
        tennis balls. This patent is directed to an apparatus for batch processing
        tennis balls for preserving their internal pressurization. The apparatus includes
        a high pressure reservoir and a lower pressure storage chamber integrally
        and unitarily housed within a single tank and separated by a bulkhead. An
        air compressor is connected to the high pressure reservoir and is controlled
        by a gauge apparatus to maintain a desired high pressure within the reservoir.
        The reservoir and storage chamber are connected together by a conduit which
        includes a low pressure regulator to maintain a desired pressure in the storage
        chamber. A passageway with an air-tight, removable lid provides access to
        the interior of the low pressure chamber for loading and unloading the tennis
        balls. The apparatus may also be used to repressurize tennis balls which have
        lost some of their inflation with compressed air.<br />(32)  The known art
        fails to address many perceived shortcomings in the industry. For example,
        a desirable improvement in the art would be the introduction of a system adapted
        to quickly recharge depleted tennis balls economically and efficiently wall
        also providing the ability to store tennis balls indefinitely.<br />(33)  Thus,
        it may be seen that these prior art patents are very limited in their teaching
        and utilization, and an improved method and apparatus for effectively recharging
        tennis balls and particularly large quantities of tennis balls quickly is
        needed to overcome these limitations. What is needed then is an improved apparatus
        and method for quickly recharging large quantities of depleted tennis balls
        in an efficient and economical manner.<br />(34) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br
        />(35)  The present invention is directed to an improved apparatus and method
        for quickly recharging large quantities of depleted tennis balls in an efficient
        and economical manner. In accordance with one exemplary embodiment of the
        present invention, a method and apparatus for recharging depleted tennis balls
        is provided that uses compressed carbon dioxide. Of particular note is the
        invention''s ability to quickly and economically recharge balls. The invention
        may advantageously utilize multiple pressure vessels to permit a user to simultaneously
        recharge and store recharged balls. The multiple pressure vessels may be arranged
        to discharge gases from a recharging vessel at high-pressure into a storage
        vessel maintained at a lower pressure. In this manner, gas may be recycled
        by moving it from a high pressure vessel to a low pressure vessel before discharge.
        High-pressure gas may also be recycled by moving it from a recharge vessel
        into another recharge vessel to partially charge the new recharge vessel.<br
        />(36)  In one exemplary embodiment of the invention, a recharge pressure
        vessel is filled with any number of discharged, flat tennis balls. The vessel
        is sealed and charged with 50 psi of carbon dioxide. The vessel is then rotated
        to dislodge any balls that may have been wedged into the side of the vessel
        to prevent wedged balls from becoming misshapen. The vessel is rotated periodically
        to maintain the desired ball shape. Within 4 to 5 days, the balls become fully
        pressurized and the pressure may be released and the recharged balls remove
        from the vessel. It is possible to recharge the balls at a pressure as low
        as 20 psi, but such a lower pressure increases the charging time to 6 weeks
        or longer. Thus, higher pressures exponentially decrease the charging time.<br
        />(37)  It is thus an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus
        and process that can be economically operated to batch process tennis balls
        in order to restore a desirable internal pressurization, thereby significantly
        increasing the useful life of the tennis balls.<br />(38)  It is a basic object
        of the present invention to provide an apparatus and method which may be used
        to repressurize tennis balls which have lost a significant amount of their
        original pressurization.<br />(39)  An additional object of the present invention
        is to provide an apparatus for storing tennis balls in a pressurized environment
        to preserve their pressurization wherein the apparatus is proportioned and
        designed for bulk processing of tennis balls and sufficient to maintain constant
        pressure for such batch processing.<br />(40)  It is a principal object of
        the present invention to provide an improved device for preserving the playing
        characteristics of an internally gas pressurized ball.<br />(41)  Another
        object of the present invention is to provide an improved vessel for preserving
        the playing characteristics of a supply of internally gas pressurized balls
        during the prolonged storage thereof.<br />(42)  Still another object of the
        present invention is to provide an improved pressure vessel for storing a
        supply of gas pressurized balls, such as tennis balls and the like, to preserve
        their original liveliness, bounce, configuration and shape.<br />(43)  Still
        a further object of the present invention is to provide an improved vessel
        of the above nature characterized by its simplicity, ruggedness, reliability,
        ease and convenience of use and application, and great versatility and adaptability.<br
        />(44)  These and other objects and advantages of the present invention, along
        with features of novelty appurtenant thereto, will appear or become apparent
        by reviewing the following detailed description of the invention.","backgroundTextHtml":null,"subHeadingM0Html":null,"subHeadingM1Html":null,"subHeadingM2Html":null,"subHeadingM3Html":null,"subHeadingM4Html":null,"subHeadingM5Html":null,"subHeadingM6Html":null,"usClassIssued":"141/11","issuedUsDigestRefClassifi":null,"datePublYear":"2010","applicationYear":"2007","pfDerwentWeekYear":null,"pfApplicationYear":null,"pfPublYear":null,"reissueApplNumber":null,"abstractHeader":null,"abstractedPublicationDerwent":null,"affidavit130BFlag":null,"affidavit130BText":null,"applicantGroup":null,"applicantHeader":null,"applicationFilingDateInt":20070619,"applicationFilingDateIntKwicHits":null,"applicationRefFilingType":null,"applicationReferenceGroup":null,"applicationSeriesAndNumber":"11820423","applicationSeriesCode":"11","assignee1":null,"assigneeDescriptiveText":null,"patentAssigneeTerms":null,"associateAttorneyName":null,"attorneyName":null,"biologicalDepositInformation":null,"applicationType":null,"unlinkedDerwentRegistryNumber":null,"unlinkedRingIndexNumbersRarerFragments":null,"claimStatement":"What
