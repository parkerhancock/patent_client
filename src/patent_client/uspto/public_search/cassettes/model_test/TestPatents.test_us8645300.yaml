        DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br />(15)  A website is generally formed of a
        plurality of distinct Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), each corresponding
        to a page of content. Each webpage of the website may represent different
        subject matter or a different function of the website, for example, separate
        webpages may be provided for ordering and purchases, order tracking, general
        information, etc.<br />(16)  When users visit a website, they are typically
        visiting for a particular purpose. By knowing the intent of their visit, that
        visitor can be more dynamically directed to the page within the website or
        namespace that best provides the information that the visitor is seeking.<br
        />(17)  Research and studies by the present inventors of online experiences
        have revealed the value of measuring and managing the interdependence of site
        visitor intent and success.<br />(18)  As visitors navigate the website, their
        intent information can be collected. The visitors may also be prompted to
        indicate how well the webpages they visit within the website match their intent.
        This information can then be analyzed to make recommendations to direct subsequent
        users to the most appropriate content on the website for the indicated intents.<br
        />(19)  A system for collecting, analyzing and using intent data is illustrated
        in FIG. 1. The system includes a web server 12 that provides web pages 13
        to a user at a web browser 14. Web pages are uploaded to the web server 12
        from various web page administrators 16. Typically, an administrator will
        represent a business or the like who has responsibility for the content of
        a website that includes multiple web pages within a website. Multiple websites,
        each containing multiple webpages, may be owned and/or administered by a single
        entity. For example, a company may have separate websites for different geographic
        locations, or a company may have distinct sub-companies or divisions. For
        the purposes of the present description, the term &quot;namespace&quot; will
        be used to cover all webpages under the control of an administrator and will
        include webpages within a single website or within multiple websites. Thus,
        the web page administrator 16 will be referred to herein as a namespace administrator.<br
        />(20)  The system further includes an intent engine 20 that collects and
        analyzes intent data from visitors as they browse webpages within a namespace.
        In one embodiment, the intent engine 20 provides an intent tool 22 that is
        used in conjunction with one or more webpages 13 within a namespace. The intent
        tool 22 may incorporate user interface display elements into a webpage that
        elicit intent and success information from users. The intent tool provides
        the collected information to the intent engine 20. The intent engine 20 process
        the intent and success information and learns to predict intent and intent-based
        destination pages.<br />(21)  In one embodiment, the intent engine 20 learns
        from users'' stated visit intent and intent based page ratings to provide
        predictive intent and predictive destination services via a compact and interactive
        web site widget. This tool fills a gap between traditional site navigation,
        faceted navigation, search, and social feedback programs to provide a unique,
        hybrid navigation and feedback tool that improves intent-based conversion
        metrics.<br />(22)  The intent engine 20 may be implemented on various platforms,
        such as .NET, or cloud based infrastructures such as Google App Engine (GAE),
        Microsoft Azure, Amazon EC2, Rackspace Cloud etc. Other implementations will
        be apparent to a person skilled in the art.<br />(23)  The intent tool will
        be described herein as a third party service offering made to owners and administrators
        of websites and namespaces. However, other implementations, such as direct
        installations by the website administrators will be apparent to a person skilled
        in the art. Similarly, the intent engine 20 will be described herein as remote
        from the web server 12. In various alternative embodiments, the intent engine
        may be incorporated into a web server and/or within a website of an organization.
        That is, intent data may be collected, analyzed and used directly by the web
        server and/or directly by the website owner.<br />(24)  The Intent engine
        20 may control multiple namespaces for different customers and may be administered
        by an intent engine administrator 18. The intent engine 20 may be operatively
        associated with an intent database 23 for storing various intent related data,
        such as page views, intent candidates, recommendations for particular web
        pages, success data, etc., as will be described in greater detail below. Data
        within the intent database 23 may be grouped by namespace, so that a particular
        namespace administrator may only access data relevant to their account.<br
        />(25)  In FIG. 2, there is shown a flowchart 100 for predicting the intent
        of a visitor to a webpage of a defined namespace. At step 101, the intent
        engine 20 receives input parameters, such as a URL or similar webpage identity
        from the web browser of a visitor. The intent engine processes the input parameters
        (step 102), for example by referencing historical intent data, to infer one
        or more intents of the visitor. At step 103, the inferred intents are provided
        to the web browser for display to the visitor.<br />(26)  A method for predicting
        a navigation destination for the visitor is depicted in the flowchart 200
        of FIG. 3. At step 201, the visitor is prompted to indicate an intent. The
        indicated intent is received into the intent engine (step 202) and processed
        to determine on or more web page recommendations (step 203). The intent engine
        may use the indicated intent to reference to historical intent data provided
        by previous visitors to the webpages of the namespace. The web page recommendations
        may be provided to the visitor web browser (step 204) for display to the visitor,
        e.g. as hyperlinks to the recommended web pages.<br />(27)  In one embodiment,
        intent and success data may be recorded as a series of data points or page
        views. Each page view may associate the URL of the viewed page, a current
        intent indicated in a display element and a success rating provided by the
        user that indicates how well the viewed webpage matches the current intent.
        An Intent Ranking Formula, described in more detail below, may be applied
        to the collective Page View data provided by multiple visitors to calculate
        intent rankings for webpages within the namespace.<br />(28)  The ranking
        process may be a two-way process. That is, each URL within the namespace may
        be associated with a ranked list of intents. Such lists may be used for inferring
        intents when a visitor navigates to that particular webpage. If the visitor
        confirms the intent, the visitor may be provided with a list of recommended
        webpages that also show a strong match to the confirmed intent.<br />(29)  The
        corollary of the intent ranking is that each Intent may be associated with
        a ranked list of URLs. The list of URLs may be used to make the recommendations
        when a visitor has confirmed their intent.<br />(30)  As described above,
        the intent tool 22 displays intent elements within each webpage of a namespace.
        The display elements may include an intent indicator, a page recommendation
        and a rating indicator. The display elements may be provided as a configurable
        widget 22 that includes coded instructions to reference the intent engine
        20 and databases 23 in response to navigation events within the user browser
        14. The individual components of the intent tool 22 may be incorporated into
        the website as a configurable widget.<br />(31)  Intent Management<br />(32)  For
        consistency and clarity, the following terminology will be used to described
        the intent based tools and methodologies. However, the terminology is provided
        by way of example only and is not intended to limit the application and scope
        of the invention.<br />(33)  Intent--a unique purpose or usage of the website.<br
        />(34)  Intent Candidates--a ranked list of Intents for the current page.<br
        />(35)  Inferred Intent--one or more of the highest ranked Intent Candidates
        for the current page. The intent tool passively applies the Inferred Intent
        to each page by default.<br />(36)  Declared Intent--an Intent that has been
        confirmed by the visitor as the purpose for the page visit.<br />(37)  Current
        Intent--the current user-specified or programmatically inferred Intent for
        the page visit. The Inferred Intent (top rated) is applied as the Current
        Intent until the user sets a Declared Intent.<br />(38)  Account--the website
        vender.<br />(39)  Account NameSpace--collection of domains and web pages
        for the website vender.<br />(40)  Current Page--the currently rendered Page
        within a web browser.<br />(41)  Destination Candidates--the ranked list of
        possible next pages for the Current Page and the Current Intent.<br />(42)  Page--a
        distinct URL of the NameSpace.<br />(43)  Success--a `thumbs-up` rating of
        a page. The highest point value available.<br />(44)  Visitor--users of the
        vender/customer''s website.<br />(45)  The intent engine 20 can be used to
        integrate a widget 22 into a webpage 13 of a website that allows a user to
        perform intent based navigation of the website. When a visitor 14 visits a
        web site, a web page 13 including the widget 22 is displayed in the web browser
        14 of the visitor.<br />(46)  In one embodiment, the intent widget 22 appears
        as an unobtrusive but always available &quot;toolbar&quot; on the customer''s
        website. It will be embedded in the page as an integral part of the site.
        An example of the intent widget is depicted in FIG. 4. It provides features
        for a Current Intent 31, which may be an inferred intent or an intent confirmed
        by the visitor, as well as Destination recommendations 32, and a Page Rating
        33.<br />(47)  When a visitor first navigates to a webpage within a namespace
        controlled by the intent engine, the intent engine 20 infers an intent of
        the visitor. In one embodiment, the URL of the current page is provided to
        the intent engine, which uses the URL as a lookup to the database 23. The
        URL reference returns a ranked list of intent candidates and the intent engine
        selects the highest ranked intent for that URL as the inferred intent. The
        inferred intent is displayed in a current intent field in the intent display
        of the webpage 13. The inferred intent may be continuously updated as the
        visitor navigates to other webpages within the namespace. The visitor may
        click a drop-down/pop-up 35 that displays the ranked list of other Intent
        Candidates for the current URL. Additionally, the visitor may type their own
        Intent into the intent tool. During text entry, the intent engine 20 may attempt
        to display auto-complete suggestions to help the visitor identify known reasons
        for visiting the website.<br />(48)  Because an inferred intent is the highest
        rated intent for a particular webpage, displaying the inferred intent can
        provide a quick indication to a visitor of the most relevant subject matter
        on that webpage. If the inferred intent does not match the visitor''s actual
        intent, then the visitor may use the intent widget to indicate a more accurate
        intent and then select the recommended page that most matches their indicated
        intent.<br />(49)  Once the visitor has selected/declared their intent, the
        indicated intent becomes the Current Intent and the intent engine 20 stops
        predicting intents as the user browses the site.<br />(50)  The intent engine
        20 also displays a continuously updated Destination Candidate 32 based upon
        the Current Intent 31. The Destination Candidate 32 may be determined by providing
        the Current Intent as a reference to the database 23 to retrieve a ranked
        list of URLs for that intent. In one embodiment, the Destination Candidate
        may be selected as the highest ranked URL of the Destination Candidate list.
        In one embodiment, the navigation history of the user may also be incorporated
        into the selection process so that if the visitor has already visited the
        highest ranked webpage for the Current Intent, then the Destination Candidate
        may be selected as the next highest candidate in the destination list, or
        the next highest and non-visited destination candidate.<br />(51)  By clicking
        the Destination Candidate 32, the visitor''s browser is immediately navigated
        to the destination page. Alternatively, the visitor may click to view a drop-down/pop-up
        list 36 of other ranked Destination Candidates. In one embodiment, the Destination
        Candidate may be displayed only once a user has confirmed their intent.<br
        />(52)  Users may jump directly to one of the suggested pages and users may
        rate the current page in respect to the visit intent. Page ratings may be
        made via various rating systems including a simple thumbs-up/thumbs-down action
        to indicate success or failure as well as more granular 1-to-5 star ratings
        of the page''s value. Whenever the visitor makes a rating, the rating data
        is added to other ratings data and used to generate subsequent intent rankings.<br
        />(53)  The system thus provides a dynamic, self-learning and self-populating
        navigation assistance tool that aids a visitor to a website to find the information
        that they are seeking.<br />(54)  Consider an Inferred Intent that has not
        been confirmed by a visitor as the visitor''s intent. The visitor may still
        indicate how well the webpage content matches the inferred intent. If the
        rating is poor, then this poor rating will affect future inferred intent calculations,
        making it less likely that that particular intent will be an inferred intent
        for that particular page for subsequent visitors. Consequently, an alternative
        and potentially more relevant intent will be inferred for that webpage which
        may receive more favorable visitor ratings.<br />(55)  Consider now a Confirmed
        Intent. When the visitor first confirms their intent, they are presented with
        recommended links to the pages that are rated most highly for that intent.
        If the visitor navigates to a recommended page but is of the opinion that
        the page content does not match the visitor''s intent, then the visitor may
        rate the page poorly. When the same situation occurs for a subsequent visitor,
        i.e. same intent, the updated intent rating statistics may cause an alternative
        (and potentially more relevant) page to be the most highly ranked page for
        the confirmed intent, and so the subsequent visitor will be recommended to
        the alternative page.<br />(56)  User indicated rankings provide a direct
        method for ranking a webpage. However, other more passive methods may also
        be incorporated as alternatives or in addition to the user rankings. For example,
        in the absence of a specific rating, navigating away from a webpage without
        performing any action on the webpage may be used to infer that the content
        did not match the visitor intent. Performing an action on the webpage, reading
        to the bottom of a screen, or lingering on the webpage, may be used to infer
        that the content of the webpage matches the visitor''s intent. All of these
        could be used to determine if the page was successful but user rankings may
        be given the highest priority.<br />(57)  In one embodiment, the configuration
        tool may also show a historical ranking of the intent for the webpage. The
        historical ranking may be an average ranking, a weighted average ranking,
        a last ranking, or some other ranking.<br />(58)  In the example of FIG. 4,
        the widget 22 is shown incorporated into a webpage for Dell Computers. The
        widget 22 includes a current intent 31 as &quot;D820 RAM upgrade&quot;. A
        user may alter the current intent by selecting other intents from a drop down
        menu 35 or by typing text directly into the current intent field 31. Based
        on the current intent, the widget 22 displays a recommendation 32 that provides
        a hyperlink to a webpage within the namespace that is most likely to provide
        the information that the visitor is seeking, i.e. that matches the current
        intent. While the highest recommendation is automatically shown by the widget
        22 in the recommendation field 32, other recommendations may be viewed and
        selected from a drop down menu 36. In the present example, the visitor is
        recommended to a page that is dedicated to &quot;DELL Latitude D820 RAM Upgrades&quot;.<br
        />(59)  At any stage, the visitor may select the rating tool 33 to indicate
        a rating of the webpage for the current intent, whether or not the visitor
        has confirmed the current intent 31 and whether or not the visitor has followed
        a link in the recommendation field 32. As shown in FIG. 4, the rating tool
        includes a scale for the visitor to rate the current page against the Current
        Intent. In one embodiment, a 7-point scale is provided using which the visitor
        may rate pages via a simple thumbs-up and thumbs-down to indicate Success
        (6) or Failure (0), or they may choose to give the page 1 to 5 stars to indicate
        degrees of Success. Other rating systems such as a score out of 10, position
        on a slide bar, selection of a category (e.g. highly relevant, moderately
        relevant, not relevant, etc) will be apparent to a person skilled in the art
        and particular rating systems are not intended to be limiting.<br />(60)  The
        visitor does not have to fully understand the &quot;Success&quot; paradigm
        or the nature of the 7-point scale. They may simply interact with familiar
        concepts, thumbs-up/down and a range of stars, as they see fit.<br />(61)  The
        intent widget 22 shown in FIG. 4 is one example configuration and a person
        skilled in the art will recognize that multiple configurations are possible.
        FIG. 5 shows an alternative configuration in which the widget 22 is displayed
        in a vertical configuration, with equivalent fields for current intent 31,
        recommendation 32 and rating tool 33 as shown for the horizontal implementation
        22. In alternative configurations, each of the intent display elements may
        be provided at separate locations within a rendering of the webpage. Some
        of the intent display elements may also be hidden within the page until activated
        or required by the visitor. For example, the recommendation field may be hidden
        until the visitor confirms their intent.<br />(62)  The widget may be configurable
        to allow variations to size, position, display order of elements, collapsibility,
        etc. In addition, the tool may be skin-able to present a company logo and/or
        a background that reflects the website vender''s 16 own branding.<br />(63)  Other
        display options are possible for the widget. In alternative embodiments, the
        intent tool may be presented as a floating toolbar that scrolls with the page,
        or as a widget that is collapsible to a small, floating intent tool indicator.
        The intent tool may also be provided as an optional browser extension that
        is used instead if the user has them installed. While the examples show single
        intents and single recommendations, the display of the widget may be altered
        so that multiple intents and/or multiple recommendations are shown at any
        one time.<br />(64)  A process for loading the intent widget will now be described
        with reference to FIG. 1 and the flowchart 300 of FIG. 6. At step 301, the
        webpage begins to load in the visitor''s browser, e.g. in response to a page
        request from the visitor 14. The loading of the web page triggers the execution
        of the intent tool script (step 302). A pageLoad event fires at step 303 causing
        an Initialize Page request to be sent to the intent engine 20. In these steps,
        the Intent Engine matches the current URL to the list of Predicted Intents
        and links to recommended pages associated to the current URL. The predictive
        intents and recommended pages are transmitted to the browser for display in
        the widget.<br />(65)  At step 305, the intent engine 20 ascertains whether
        the URL is a valid URL within the namespace of a website governed by the intent
        engine 20. If the URL is invalid, the process stops (step 306). If the URL
        is valid, the intent engine then optionally determines whether the Visitor
        is defined (step 307). If the Visitor is not defined in the intent engine,
        then a new Visitor ID may be created (step 308). The process then proceeds
        to calculate a top intent list (step 309). The top intent list may be determined
        using the URL, a Visitor ID, or other parameter as a lookup to the intent
        data of the intent database 23.<br />(66)  The process 300 then determines
        whether the visitor has confirmed or declared an intent (step 310). If the
        intent has been declared, the declared intent and namespace is used as a lookup
        to the database 23 to determine one or more recommended URL destinations within
        the namespace that match the declared intent (step 311). If no intent has
        been declared, the top intent is used as the lookup reference instead (step
        312) to generate the recommended URL destinations. At step 313, the intent
        and destination lists are returned by the intent engine to the web server
        12 to be incorporated in the widget 22 displayed in the web page 13 provided
        to the user browser 14.<br />(67)  A state diagram 400, illustrated in FIG.
        7, shows states of the widget within a website as a visitor navigates their
        way around the website. After starting 401, the widget displays the top rated
        intent and destination data 402. After a pageload event, the widget waits
        for inferred or predicted intent data and recommendations from the intent
        engine for the URL to which the user has navigated 403. After receiving the
        intent data, the widget displays the predicted recommendations 404 based on
        inferred intents. The widget then prompts or awaits feedback from the visitor
        to rate the URL for the indicated intent 405. Rating feedback for an indicated
        intent is recorded in the database 23 and used to prepare future intent ratings
        and recommendations. Visitor feedback may include page ratings and intent
        selections as well as selection of recommendations. If the feedback from the
        visitor includes a confirmation or indication of the visitor''s intent, then
        the widget state moves to displaying predications based upon the confirmed
        intent 406. The widget state returns to feedback prompting 405 in which the
        same feedback actions, including recording page ratings, can be made as previously,
        though now based upon the confirmed intent. If the user navigates to another
        URL within the namespace, the widget waits for a pageload of the new URL 407,
        and then waits for intent data from the intent engine 20 for the new URL 408.
        The widget then returns to the state 406 in which recommendations for the
        confirmed intent are displayed.<br />(68)  A high level data flow diagram
        will now be described with reference to FIG. 8. When an administrator of a
        website or namespace that includes multiple pages embarks on an installation
        and configuration process 71 of the intent widget 22, customer source files
        are provided from a source file database 72 of the intent engine. When a web
        page is requested from a user browser 74, the web page files, such as HTML
        and JavaScript files are provided to the Load Web Page process 75. The process
        75 executes the intent widget script which causes an &quot;Init Page&quot;
        request 76 to be sent to an initialize view process that executes in the intent
        engine. The initialize view process 77 retrieves namespace data from a customer
        database 68 in order to validate that the requested page is part of a namespace
        controlled by the intent engine and to ascertain any rules that are dependent
        on that namespace. Assuming authentication, intent variables are then retrieved
        from an intent candidate cache 78, and ranking data from a page intent ranking
        data store 79.<br />(69)  The intent candidate data and page intent ranking
        data is returned to the load web page process 75 for rendering the web page,
        including the intent widget, to the user''s browser 75. For statistical recording,
        the page for which intent data was requested may be recorded to a page view
        datastore 69.<br />(70)  Each of the datastores illustrated in FIG. 8 may
        be provided as components of the database 23 of FIG. 1.<br />(71)  Dataflows
        during the &quot;Init Page&quot; process are shown in more detail in FIG.
        9. Within the user''s browser 74, a request 81 is provided to the intent engine
        to trigger an authorization process 82 within the intent engine. The intent
        engine receives a customer ID or URL from a session cookie 83 of the user
        browser 74 and uses this information as a lookup to the customer/namespace
        database 68 to confirm that the URL is within a valid namespace of the intent
        engine. If the authorization proceeds, the authorization process 82 passes
        the Customer ID to an Identify User process 84. The process 84 receives a
        visitor ID from the session cookie 83 and passes the Visitor ID and the Customer
        ID to a Record Page View process 85. If the visitorID has not been defined
        a new visitorID is generated and returned to the session cookie. The Record
        Page View process includes identifying the page, caching the page view and
        writing the cached page view to the Page Views datastore 69. The page may
        be identified by receiving a Page ID from a pages datastore 86. The Record
        Page View aggregates the Page ID, Visitor ID as well as any Intent and Ranking
        information from the user session 83 and stores this data collectively in
        the Page Views datastore 69. When a page load happens the visited page is
        associated with the intent and given a default rank. Thus each page load does
        affect the rank but much less than a user defined ranking.<br />(72)  The
        Page and Intent information is then passed to a Create Intent List process
        87. The page data is used as a lookup to the Intent Candidate Cache to retrieve
        one or more intent candidates. The process 87 creates an intent list of intent
        candidates which is then passed to a Create Destination List process 88. The
        current intent and URL are used as a lookup to the Page Rank Matrix 79 to
        select recommended URLs that match the current intent. The Process 88 creates
        the destination list and then passes the intent list and the destination list
        to user browser 74 for display in the appropriate fields of the widget.<br
        />(73)  As described above, a user may indicate their intent by selecting
        an inferred intent from the intent field of the widget or by entering a new
        intent into the intent field. The confirmed intent is sent to the session
        cookie 83 which prevents the Page Initialization process from generating inferred
        intent lists each time the Visitor navigates to another webpage of the namespace.<br
        />(74)  If the intent entered is a new intent for the namespace and/or the
        particular URL, the intent may be entered into an Intents datastore, provided
        as part of the database 23. When subsequent visitors use the widget, the user-entered
        intent may be listed as an inferred intent, in particular where that intent
        has been rated highly for the URL or namespace. By allowing users to enter
        and rate their own intents, the intent engine can be provided as a dynamic
        self-learning and self-populating system.<br />(75)  Page Rating<br />(76)  One
        data point that drives the intent engine is the visitors'' rating of pages.
        This value drives the calculation of Inferred Intent and Recommended Destination
        pages.<br />(77)  Rating Scale<br />(78)  Page Ratings may be recorded on
        a 7-point (0 to 6) scale with zero indicating Failure and 6 indicating Success.<br

        Useful<br />(80)  Ratings Data<br />(81)  All page ratings are recorded in
        respect to the visitor''s Current Intent. Only one record will be recorded
        per visitor, per page, per intent. Therefore, if during a single website browsing
        session the visitor rates the same page twice, then the second rating replaces
        the first rating of the page.<br />(82)  The Page rank data structure may
        be depicted as follows:<br />(83)   TABLE-US-00002 Field\tType\tNotes ID\tint\tIdentifies
        a unique visitor-page-rank instance PageID\tint\tThe page VisitorID\tint\tThe
        visitor TimeStamp\tDateTime\tWhen IntentID\tint\tThe Intent Rank\tbyte (a
        small # data type)\tThe ranking<br />(84)  The dataflows for page ranking
        are illustrated in FIG. 10. When a user provides a ranking, a rank request
        90 is first sent from the user browser 74 to the intent engine 20. The rank
        request triggers a Moderate Abuse process 91 which uses t Visitor ID to retrieve
        a visitor history from an abuse history datastore 92. The visitor history
        is processed to determine whether the visitor has a history of spamming or
        otherwise mis-using the intent engine processes.<br />(85)  If the abuse history
        is clear, then the rank request is passed to an authorization request process
        93. The authorization process 93 is similar to the process 82 described above
        in FIG. 9 and uses the customer ID or URL received from the session cookie
        83 of the browser 74 to ensure that the URL involved is within a namespace
        governed by the intent engine. Identifying the namespace within a customers
        datastore 68 also allows any namespace specific rules to be determined.<br
        />(86)  Once authorized, an Identify Page process 94 is triggered which uses
        the URL provided from the Authorization process 93 to extract a page identity
        from the Pages datastore 86. A Cache Page View with Rank process 95 is then
        performed. The caching process 95 receives the visitor, intent and rank data
        from the session cookie 83 and the page data from the Identify Page process
        94. This data is cached as a PageView in the PageView cache while a Queue
        Write-behind Task 97 is prepared. When the queue 99 reaches the specific cache
        writing task, a Write Cache to Database task 98 retrieves any pageview data
        from the cache and writes to the Page Views datastore 69. At the end of the
        process, the Page Views datastore includes one or more page views that each
        associate a page (URL), an intent and a visitor ranking of the intent for
        the page.<br />(87)  The Intent Ranking Formula<br />(88)  The page/intent/ranking
        data of the Page Views datastore 69 may be processed by the intent engine
        to periodically calculate ordered lists of ranked Intent Candidates and ordered
        lists of Destination candidates per page per intent.<br />(89)  The processing
        of the data may be based on an intent ranking formula that may be fixed or
        may be configurable per namespace account. Various ranking formulas may be
        used and many standard formulas will be apparent to a person skilled in the
        art. In a simple embodiment, the ranked lists may be generated by averaging
        a ranking of a page/intent combination across all applicable page views that
        include that page/intent combination. In a more complex formula, page view
        dated may be aged so that more recent data is weighted favorably while page
        view data older than a particular threshold is ignored completely.<br />(90)  In
        alternative embodiments, more complex intent ranking formulas may be applied.
        In one embodiment, there are three variable types and each variable is calculated
        at the Page and Site scope for a total of 6 variables. Each variable has a
        value between 0 and 100 and is then multiplied by an Account specific modifier
        to customize the formula for each Account.<br />(91)  Unit Days<br />(92)  A
        portion of the Intent Ranking Formula is time sensitive so that more recent
        feedback may be weighted accordingly. The Unit Days attribute determines how
        quickly the time element ages feedback and it allows the formula to work equally
        well on busy and slow websites. Essentially, this attribute determines how
        many days of values to group together in each &quot;bucket&quot; of aged results.
        The default value, 1.0, ages data every day. Adjusting this value to 2.0,
        for example, ages the data every two days. While adjusting this value to 7.0
        ages the data every 7 days.<br />(93)  Freshness Value<br />(94)  The Freshness
        Value uses the Unit Days attribute (above) to reflect how recently a given
        Intent has been used. With this value, the &quot;freshness&quot; of the data
        exponentially effects the Intent ranking, with newer entries valued more than
        older entries.<br />(95)  Page Freshness<br />(96)  Page Freshness is calculated
        per Intent per Page. It indicates how recently a given Intent was used for
        the current page.<br />(97)  Site Freshness<br />(98)  Site Freshness is calculated
        per Intent for the entire site or namespace. It indicates how recently a given
        Intent was used anywhere on the site.<br />(99)  Freshness Modifier<br />(100)  For
        each Freshness calculation, page and site, the Account Administrator may adjust
        a modifier value to increase or decrease the affect of Freshness on the Intent
        Ranking. Therefore, by adjusting the Unit Days attribute and the Freshness
        Modifiers the Account Administrator has significant control over the time-sensitiveness
        of the Intent Ranking Formula. The default Freshness Modifier is 1.0.<br />(101)  Popularity
        Value<br />(102)  The Popularity Value reflects how often a given Intent has
        been used.<br />(103)  Page Popularity<br />(104)  Page Popularity is calculated
        per Intent per Page. It indicates how frequently a given Intent was used for
        the current page.<br />(105)  Site Popularity<br />(106)  Site Popularity
        is calculated per Intent for the entire site or namespace. It indicates how
        frequently a given Intent was used anywhere on the site.<br />(107)  Popularity
        Modifier<br />(108)  For each Popularity calculation, page and site, the Account
        Administrator may adjust a modifier value to increase or decrease the affect
        of Popularity on the Intent Ranking. The default Popularity Modifier is 1.0.<br
        />(109)  Effectiveness Value<br />(110)  The Effectiveness Value reflects
        the visitor page ratings for a given Intent. In other words, it indicates
        how high or low visitors rated pages overall when using each Intent.<br />(111)  Page
        Effectiveness<br />(112)  Page Effectiveness is calculated per Intent per
        Page. It indicates how well visitors rated the current page per Intent.<br
        />(113)  Site Effectiveness<br />(114)  Site Effectiveness is calculated per
        Intent for the entire site or namespace. It indicates how well visitors rated
        all pages on the site per Intent.<br />(115)  Effectiveness Modifier<br />(116)  For
        each Effectiveness calculation, page and site, the Account Administrator may
        adjust a modifier value to increase or decrease the affect of Effectiveness
        on the Intent Ranking. The default Effectiveness Modifier is 1.0.<br />(117)  Summary
        of the Intent Ranking Formula<br />(118)  It can be seen from the above, that
        the Intent Ranking Formula may be provided in various embodiments as a combination
        of three types of values (Freshness, Popularity, and Effectiveness) measured
        at two different levels of scope (Per Page and Per Site) for a total of 6
        different variables. In addition, each variable may be modified by a fixed
        multiplier to increase or decrease the importance of each variable for the
        site.<br />(119)  The intent ranking formula may applied each time the formula
        is updated. All matrixes would be recalculated at that time otherwise the
        current formula is used for all calculations of new and updated data. Calculations
        of intent rankings may be made on a periodic basis, e.g. hourly, daily, etc
        or may be made on the fly, i.e. each page view or after a threshold number
        of page views. Other timeframes will be apparent to the person skilled in
        the art.<br />(120)  FIG. 11 shows a chart of a hypothetical visualization
        of how the Intent Ranking Formula might evaluate a &quot;purchase&quot; intent
        and an &quot;order tracking&quot; intent for a single page on a customer''s
        website.<br />(121)  As described above, the intent engine 20 may be provided
        as a third party offering to namespace administrators. These administrators
        may thus be considered as customer''s of the intent engine. The intent engine
        20 may provide a database-backed interface 16 to allow a customer to administer
        their intent engine account. This includes defining and configuring the customer''s
        namespace, configuring and monitoring Intent options, and viewing various
        usage and trending reports.<br />(122)  In addition, an Intent Engine administrator
        website allows for the intent engine administrator 18 to configure and monitor
        of the entire intent engine system and customers. This includes overall reporting,
        support, billing, and access control.<br />(123)  Page Management<br />(124)  In
        general, the intent engine''s algorithms and features are page-centric. Thus,
        Page Management is a critical step in configuring and managing an intent engine
        installation.<br />(125)  The intent engine tracks each distinct URL of a
        NameSpace as a Page. There are many corner cases that affect the definition
        of a page, but in the most general case the intent engine considers a unique
        page to be represented by the part of the URL between the Scheme and the Query
        String.<br />(126)  Page Terminology<br />(127)  There are several contexts
        of a Page in the intent engine, as follows.<br />(128)  Current Page--represents
        the URL that the visitor is currently viewing in the browser window. The intent
        engine 20 uses the top or parent page and ignores iFrames, Frames, and other
        embedded page types.<br />(129)  Destination Candidate--represents a list
        of Pages that the intent engine 20 recommends to the visitor based upon the
        Current Page and the Current Intent.<br />(130)  Recommended Destination--the
        top rated Destination Candidate.<br />(131)  Destination Link--the dynamically
        composed URL of a Destination Candidate. It is dynamically composed so that
        session specific information is handled appropriately.<br />(132)  Page Rules<br
        />(133)  Account Administrators and Account Moderators may be nominated for
        each account and allowed modify the Page Rules for an intent engine account.
        The Page Rules determine how URLs are parsed to identify unique pages and
        how URLs are dynamically re-assembled to provide Destination Links when the
        user chooses to jump directly to a Recommended Destination Page.<br />(134)  Basic
        URL Identification<br />(135)  All URLs are initially identified by the Host
        and Path. Scheme, Query String, and Fragments are generally ignored in respect
        to identifying unique Pages. For example:<br />(136)   TABLE-US-00003 URL:
        http://www.server.com/path/to/file/page.html?one=l&amp;two=2&amp;three=3 Scheme\thttp://
        Host\twww.server.com Path\tpath/to/file/page.html QueryString\tone=1&amp;two=2&amp;three=3<br
        />(137)  Supported Scheme<br />(138)  The intent engine 20 may track which
        schemes have been used to view each rated page. The visitors'' current URL
        scheme may be used for destination pages when possible. Therefore, if the
        destination page has only been viewed via HTTPS and the visitor is on another
        page using HTTP, then the destination page link will use HTTPS. However, if
        the page has been visited via both schemes, the user''s current scheme will
        be used. Optionally, the Account may be configured to always use the visitor''s
        current Scheme when constructing Destination Links.<br />(139)  Authority
        (Sub-Domain)<br />(140)  Customer NameSpaces may be configured to dynamically
        handle URLs that are differentiated only by the authority/sub-domain. For
        example, the JCPenney NameSpace would be configured such that ww2.jcpenney.com
        and ww5.jcpenney.com are considered the same URL. However, blog.jcpenney.com
        and search.jcpenney.com may be treated as different URLs. By default, all
        Host name permutations will be treated as unique and independent. The Customer
        NameSpace may be configured with regular expressions that describe Host names
        that should be treated the same.<br />(141)  Default Query String Management<br
        />(142)  In general, Query Strings will be ignored by the intent engine''s
        page definitions. That is, the uniqueness of a page is not determined by the
        Query String. However, the intent engine 20 may track which Query String Parameters
        have been used for each page and what value was assigned to each parameter
        the first time it was encountered. These values will be used to help construct
        Destination Links.<br />(143)  Destination Links will be crafted based upon
        the visitor''s current page Query String and the known Query String Parameters
        supported by the destination page. For example, for a given url such as:<br
        />(144)  www.server.com/pageone.html?state=ny&amp;color=blue,<br />(145)  the
        intent engine may record the following types of information about the url.<br
        />(146)   TABLE-US-00004 URL ID\tParam\tDefault Value 101\tstate\tny 101\tcolor\tblue<br
        />(147)  For a future visitor that is viewing the page www.server.com/pagetwo.html?state=tx&amp;sz=lg,
        the intent engine''s Destination Link to pageone will be composed by comparing
        the visitor''s current Query String Parameters to those known to be supported
        by the intent engine.<br />(148)  &quot;state&quot; is supported by pageone
        and included in the visitor''s current page.<br />(149)  Parameter values
        will be used from the current page when possible. Therefore, the &quot;tx&quot;
        value will be assigned to &quot;state&quot; for the Destination Candidate
        link.<br />(150)  &quot;color&quot; is supported by pageone but not included
        in the current page. &quot;color&quot; with the default value &quot;blue&quot;
        will be used for the Destination Candidate link.<br />(151)  &quot;sz&quot;
        is included on the Current Page, but not in the Destination Candidate. Therefore
        &quot;sz&quot; will not be included in the Destination Candidate link.<br
        />(152)  Therefore, the Destination Link from pagetwo to pageone for this
        user will be: www.server.com/pageone.html?state=tx&amp;color=blue<br />(153)  Fixed
        Query String Parameters<br />(154)  Many websites will require additional
        configurations to intelligently handle Query String Parameters. A common example
        would be a url like http://www.google.com/search?q=schueler where the &quot;q&quot;
        Query String Parameter (QSP) is critical to the definition of the page. The
        intent engine may allow customers to configure QSP''s that are to be treated
        as part of the unique identification of a page.<br />(155)  In this case,
        &quot;q&quot; would be identified as a Fixed QSP and thus the intent engine
        will record unique page instances for http://www.google.com/search?q=schueler
        and http://www.google.com/search?q=beynon and will not replace the &quot;q&quot;
        value when constructing Destination Candidates.<br />(156)  Managing Account
        Intents<br />(157)  Account Administrators and Account Moderators may view
        and edit the list of known Intents for their NameSpace. In particular, new
        intents may be added and intents may be deleted, in particular where those
        intents have been indicated by visitors to the page. Intents provided by visitors
        may also be modified by the administrators/moderators, for example, to use
        consistent terminology and/or terminology preferred by the namespace owner.<br
        />(158)  Site Conversion<br />(159)  Website &quot;conversion&quot; is one
        of the most traditional and widespread measures of a site''s effectiveness.
        Analytics packages and entire web site strategies are often geared around
        a company''s definition of &quot;conversion&quot; of a site visitor. Conversion
        may be defined in a multitude of ways including purchasing a product, subscribing
        to a newsletter, submitting contact information, or becoming a &quot;fan&quot;
        via a social networking site.<br />(160)  The intent engine 20 provides a
        model for incorporating traditional site Conversion metrics into aggregate
        intent data.<br />(161)  Conversion Rules<br />(162)  The Account Administrator
        may define a set of Conversion URLs via regular expressions. The intent engine
        20 will provide a set of example regular expressions that will match a variety
        of common URL patterns. One usage option will be to append a specially coded
        Query String Parameter to any URL on the site that will indicate that the
        user has completed some form of conversion.<br />(163)  Whenever a Conversion
        URL is encountered, the intent engine will record the instance and gather
        aggregate data about pre-defined conversion that may be viewed via the intent
        Reports.<br />(164)  Conversion Rule Data<br />(165)   TABLE-US-00005 Field\tDescription
        ID\tunique identifier Name\tShort descriptor Marketing Campaign\tOptional.
        ID of corresponding marketing campaign. URLs\tSet of regular expressions that
        trigger conversion. Start Date\tBeginning of date range when the rule applies
        End Date\tEnd of date range when the rule applies<br />(166)  Conversion Event
        Data<br />(167)  Once a visitor has triggered a Conversion Rule, the intent
        engine 20 will record the Conversion Event using data similar to the table
        below. However, the system may be configured so that a visitor will only trigger
        a Conversion Rule once per visit even if they load multiple URLs that match
        the given regular expression(s).<br />(168)   TABLE-US-00006 Field\tDescription
        Conversion Rule\tWhich rule triggered conversion Converted_At\tDate/Time of
        the event URL\tThe source URL of conversion Intent\tThe user''s current intent,
        if defined.<br />(169)  Campaign Management<br />(170)  Campaigns are the
        website owner''s method for implementing temporary modifications to the intent
        engine''s configuration to achieve specific marketing or support goals.<br
        />(171)  Pre-Seeding Campaign<br />(172)  Pre-seeding campaigns are used to
        &quot;seed&quot; the intent engine with sufficient data for the system to
        be released to the general population.<br />(173)  The first step of a pre-seeding
        campaign is to manually enter Intents and Destination Links for the NameSpace.
        A user interface is provided to the namespace administrator 16 to allow administrators
        and moderators of a namespace to enter the required values and match them
        together and to store the pre-seed data in the databases 23 of the intent
        engine 20.<br />(174)  The second step of a pre-seeding campaign is to invite
        a select group of users to browse the website with the intent engine in seeding-mode
        for that namespace. For example, the pre-seeding visitors may be prompted
        to rate the webpages for the visitor''s intent with all the data being stored
        as seed data that will later be used to make recommendations. For the pre-seeding
        visitors, all recommendations may be blocked until sufficient data has been
        stored so that statistically relevant recommendations can be made. Options
        for pre-seeding visitors include hiding all Destination Recommendation features,
        hiding for X % of visitors but displaying for y %, only displaying recommendations
        for users within a certain IP range (employees pre-seed), displaying for users
        with a certain cookie, prompting for a list of intents on each page, not just
        one intent, etc. Other pre-seeding options and strategies will be apparent
        to a person skilled in the art.<br />(175)  Spotlight Campaign<br />(176)  A
        spotlight campaign may be used to artificially promote certain Intents and/or
        Destination Candidates to highlight items for customer support or marketing
        purposes.<br />(177)  Options for spotlighting may include, artificially inflating
        the ranking of an Intent across the site or for a range of pages, artificially
        inflating the ranking of a Page for a set of Intents and/or inserting a new,
        temporary Intent, that only exists for the duration of the Campaign<br />(178)  Content
        Moderation<br />(179)  A Content Moderator may be provided for each customer
        account and may use the intent engine website to manage Content Filters, Content
        Governors, and Content Alerts.<br />(180)  Content Filters<br />(181)  Content
        filtering rules provide two levels of brand protection. First, the Moderator
        may establish the Acceptable Use Policy filters that determine which words
        and phrases that should be blocked for the website community. Second, the
        Moderator may establish procedures for dealing with content that violates
        the site''s AUP.<br />(182)  AUP Language Filter<br />(183)  Moderators may
        upload and edit a word list of unacceptable words that will be filtered from
        the site. In one embodiment, a pre-loaded or default wordlist may be provided.<br
        />(184)  AUP Brand Filter<br />(185)  Moderators may also upload and edit
        a word list of competitor brand related terms that may be moderated differently
        than swear words. This list aims to protect the site from crowd based attacks
        on the integrity of the intent engine''s data set. For example, a manufacturer
        of one type of product may wish to prevent a visitor from specifying an intent
        to buy a rival manufacturer''s equivalent product.<br />(186)  AUP Filter
        Actions<br />(187)  The Moderator may be provided with the ability to configure
        Filtering Actions for both the Language Filter and the Brand Filter. Unique
        actions may be configured based upon the violated filter and the type of content.<br
        />(188)  Mask Words<br />(189)  Entries are accepted by the system but triggering
        words are masked with a pre-defined character sequence. The Moderator may
        choose the masking character and a fixed number of times to use the character.
        Thus, no matter the length of the word it will be replaced with a fixed length
        character mask. This may be provided as the default for Open Text Entries
        that violate the Language Filter.<br />(190)  Discard Entries<br />(191)  Entries
        are discarded before being saved to the database. A running log is updated
        to note the action, but the actual entry is not saved. This may be the default
        setting for Intent Entries that violate the Language Filter.<br />(192)  Moderator
        Alerts<br />(193)  Entries are accepted into the system and put into immediate
        use. However, the Account Moderator is alerted and given the opportunity to
        remove the entry. Notification is a two-fold process. First, a daily email
        is sent to the Moderators with a summary of the Content Alerts. Second, the
        intent engine website''s account moderation screen will provide access to
        entries that may need moderating based upon the Language and Brand Filters.
        The Moderator may choose to apply word masks or hide the entries from users.
        This may be the default setting for Intent Entries and Open Text Entries that

        />(196)  Governors<br />(197)  Account Moderators may configure various governors
        to try to prevent abuse of the intent engine system. For example, user Governors
        may be designed to prevent a given user, or Bot, from flooding the intent
        engine. User governors may be based upon an IP address, cookies, limiting
        new intents submitted per user per timeframe, limiting intent Page Views submitted
        per user per timeframe, limiting page ratings submitted per user per timeframe.
        Content governors may be employed to protect the intent engine from crowd-based
        attacks to game the system. Content governors may be language and/or brand
        filter based.<br />(198)  Alerts<br />(199)  Account Moderators may receive
        various intent engine usage alerts as will be described below.<br />(200)  Language
        &amp; Brand Filter Thresholds<br />(201)  The Moderator may define a per hour
        threshold for the usage of any word or phrase in the Language and Brand filter
        lists. When this threshold is exceeded an email is sent to the account Moderator.
        The threshold may be throttled uniquely for each filter list and it may be
        turned off temporarily.<br />(202)  Volume Thresholds<br />(203)  The Moderator
        may define per hour and per day volume thresholds for Intent Page Views, New
        Intent Submissions, and Page Ratings. Thresholds may be specific counts (i.e.
        &amp;gt;10 k) or based on relative changes.<br />(204)  Black List and White
        List Alerts<br />(205)  Moderators may configure a Black List of undesirable
        words or phrases and a White List of desired words and phrases. Usage of these
        words in a new intent or open text feedback will immediately send an email
        alert to the Moderator in case immediate action is required.<br />(206)  Reports<br
        />(207)  Account Administrators and Moderators may view various reports about
        intent engine usage and trends. These reports may be executed as one or more
        queries to the database 23 coupled to the intent engine 20.<br />(208)  For
        example, an overall site success report may specify: Overall site success
        percentage; Conversion percentages (for each Conversion Rule); Search percentage;
        Browse percentage.<br />(209)  An Intent Summary Report may include statistics
        for Success percentage per Intent; Top Success Pages per Intent; Conversion
        percentages per Intent; Filter by User Generated Intents vs pre-defined Intents.<br

        Listing of pages as defined by the intent engine, which may be sorted by Intent
        when viewing the page; intent engine Effectiveness (user ratings); intent
        engine Popularity (viewed with any Intent) and Conversion.<br />(212)  A Page
        Drill Down Report may list all Intents used for the given Page as well as
        Intent Effectiveness on the page, Conversion on the page and Success (highest
        rating) on the page.<br />(213)  As described above, the intent engine service
        website provides a turn-key service for subscribing, implementing, monitoring,

        relates to systems and methods for processing information from visitors to
        one or more websites.<br />(3) BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br />(4)  Websites
        have become valuable resources for companies to engage consumers and customers.
        Paramount to the success of a website is that visitors to the website can
        readily identify and navigate to the pages within the website that contain
        the information or perform the functions that correspond to the visitor''s
        intent.<br />(5)  What is required are improved systems and methods for determining
        a visitor''s intent and for using the visitor''s intent to predict and suggest
        webpages for the visitor.<br />(6) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br />(7)  In one
        aspect of the disclosure, there is provided a method for predicting an intent
        of a visitor to a webpage. The method comprises receiving into an intent engine
        at least one input parameter from a web browser displaying the webpage. The
        input parameter is processed by the intent engine to determine at least one
        inferred intent. The inferred intent can be sent to the visitor''s web browser
        that is displaying the webpage so that the inferred intent is displayed to
        the visitor.<br />(8)  In one aspect of the disclosure, there is provided
        a method for predicting a navigation destination for a visitor of a webpage
        belonging to a defined namespace comprising a plurality of webpages. The method
        comprises prompting the visitor to indicate an intent on a webpage displayed
        at a browser of the visitor. The indicated intent is received into an intent
        engine for processing. Processing of the indicated intent comprises using
        the indicated intent as a reference to intent ranking data that ranks the
        plurality of webpages for the indicated intent. The intent ranking data may
        have been provided by previous visitors to one or more webpages of the namespace.
        The processing of the indicated intent determines one or more recommended
        webpages defined to be within the namespace that most match the indicated
        intent. Links to the recommended webpages can be displayed in the visitor''s
        browser.<br />(9)  In one aspect of the disclosure, there is provided an intent
        processing system comprising an intent engine and at least one database configured
        to store intent data. The intent engine may be configured to display an intent
        tool in at least one webpage when the at least one webpage is loaded into
        a user browser. The intent tool may comprise a plurality of display elements
        including one or more of an intent field, a recommendation field, and a ranking
        tool. The intent engine may also be configured to display at least one intent
        in the intent field, display at least one webpage recommendation in the recommendation
        field, and receive ranking data from the ranking tool and store the ranking
        data in the at least one database.","backgroundTextHtml":null,"subHeadingM0Html":null,"subHeadingM1Html":null,"subHeadingM2Html":null,"subHeadingM3Html":null,"subHeadingM4Html":null,"subHeadingM5Html":null,"subHeadingM6Html":null,"usClassIssued":"706/46","issuedUsDigestRefClassifi":null,"datePublYear":"2014","applicationYear":"2011","pfDerwentWeekYear":null,"pfApplicationYear":null,"pfPublYear":null,"reissueApplNumber":null,"abstractHeader":null,"abstractedPublicationDerwent":null,"affidavit130BFlag":null,"affidavit130BText":null,"applicantGroup":["Cowdrey;
