        />[0037] So that the manner in which the features and advantages of the embodiments
        of systems, computer-readable media, interfaces, and methods of the present
        invention, as well as others, which will become apparent, may be understood
        in more detail, a more particular description of the embodiments of systems,
        computer-readable media, interfaces, and methods of the present invention
        briefly summarized above may be had by reference to the embodiments thereof,
        which are illustrated in the appended drawings, which form a part of this
        specification. It is to be noted, however, that the drawings illustrate only
        various embodiments of the embodiments of systems, computer-readable media,
        interfaces, and methods of the present invention and are therefore not to
        be considered limiting of the embodiments of systems, computer-readable media,
        interfaces, and methods of the present invention's scope as it may include
        other effective embodiments as well.<br />[0038] Systems, methods, and computer-readable
        media for autonomous direct controlled steering in directional drilling can
        use substantially online data transmission (that is, data transmission that
        can be accomplished during drilling) to take drilling parameter measurements
        at one or more downhole locations. Wired drill pipe, for example, can enable
        online data transmission, as can additional or other hardware and signals,
        as will be understood by those skilled in the art. These measurements can
        be used, along with data validation and reconciliation techniques, to produce
        reliable online information from downhole and surface variables in real-time
        intervals. Further, such direct control in autonomous directional drilling
        can be based on joint control of downhole torque on bit (DTOB) and toolface
        orientation while taking into consideration the coupling dynamics between
        torque and angular displacement in slide drilling. Additionally, control methods
        can adaptively predict the impact of changing downhole torque on the toolface
        orientation and can compensate accordingly for that impact in advance before
        it can influence the toolface angular displacement. In some instances, a closed-loop
        control of directional drilling can include a first set of control operations
        that ensure stability and robustness of automated directional drilling against
        a wide range of external disturbances, measurement errors, and unknown lithology
        and hydraulic conditions. Such a first set of control operations can be implemented
        fully either in a downhole device or in a surface application. Further, such
        a first set of control operations can be executed by a controller to issue
        operating commands to a drilling equipment system (including, for example,
        one or more of a rotating system, a hoisting system, a circulating system,
        and a downhole rotary steerable system (RSS)) that can either directly or
        indirectly affect one or more drilling parameters. Additionally, in some circumstances,
        a closed-loop control of directional drilling also can include a second set
        of control operations that can evaluate the drilling operating conditions
        and adaptively modify the first set of control operations thereby to alter
        the manner of issuing operating commands to one or more of a rotating system,
        a hoisting system, a circulating system, and a downhole RSS. The second set
        of control operations can include online adjusting the control parameters
        used as input to the first set of control operations, as well as choosing
        a suitable control structure from a database based on one or more if-then
        scenarios. Still further, a closed-loop control of directional drilling also
        can include a third set of control operations that can determine an optimal
        rate of penetration (ROP) online to enhance the overall directional drilling
        performance by estimating short- to mid-term future values of a preselected
        set of downhole variables and by solving a set of parametric constrained optimization
        problems. Each set of control operations can be associated with one or more
        separate controllers or other computing devices, or one or more sets of control
        operations can be associated with the same controller or other computing devices.<br
        />[0039] Embodiments of the invention can include, for example, systems to
        control directional drilling in borehole drilling for hydrocarbon wells. A
        system <b>100</b> according to an embodiment, for instance, can relate to
        a borehole <b>102</b> for a hydrocarbon well extending from a surface into
        subterranean material, as illustrated in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG.
        1</figref>, for example. Such a system <b>100</b> can include a drill string
        <b>104</b> positioned within the borehole <b>102</b>. A drill string <b>104</b>
        can include one or more substantially cylindrical segments of drill pipe <b>106</b>,
        a wire drilling line <b>117</b>, a bottom hole assembly (BHA) <b>108</b>,
        a drill bit <b>110</b>, and a downhole drive controller <b>112</b> to control
        and adjust rotation of the drill bit <b>110</b>. A downhole drive controller
        <b>112</b> can include, for example, a controller associated with the RSS.
        A drill bit <b>110</b> can be located at the bottom of the BHA <b>108</b>,
        as illustrated in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 1</figref>, for example.
        A system <b>100</b> further can include a top drive <b>114</b> or other rotating
        system positioned substantially at the surface and connected to the drill
        string <b>104</b>. Operation of the top drive <b>114</b> can rotate the drill
        string <b>104</b> within the borehole <b>102</b> along an axis substantially
        parallel to the walls of the borehole <b>102</b>. Such a top drive <b>114</b>
        can be a device or assembly made up of one or more components or machines
        (including, for example, one or more motors, one or more gears, and a rotary
        mechanism) that is operable to rotate the drill string <b>104</b> within the
        borehole <b>102</b>. In addition, a system <b>100</b> can include a drawworks
        <b>116</b> or other hoisting system positioned substantially at the surface
        and connected to the drill string <b>104</b>. The drawworks <b>116</b> can
        include a substantially cylindrical spool around which the wire drilling line
        <b>117</b> can be wound. Further, the drawworks <b>116</b> also can include
        a pulley <b>119</b> and a brake to inhibit unwinding of the wire drilling
        line <b>117</b> from the spool. Operation of the drawworks <b>116</b> can
        rotate the spool thereby to extend the wire drilling line <b>117</b> into
        the borehole <b>102</b> and, alternatively, to retract the wire drilling line
        <b>117</b> from the borehole <b>102</b>. That is, operation of the drawworks
        <b>116</b> thereby can lower the drill string <b>104</b> into the borehole
        <b>102</b> and alternatively can reel the drill string <b>104</b> in from
        the borehole <b>102</b>. Consequently, operation of the drawworks <b>116</b>
        can control ROP of the drill string <b>104</b>. The drawworks <b>116</b> can
        be a device or assembly made up of one or more components or machines (including,
        for example, the wire drilling line <b>117</b>, one or more spools, one or
        more pulleys <b>119</b>, and one or more brakes) that is operable to hoist
        the drill string <b>104</b> in and out of the borehole <b>102</b>. A system
        <b>100</b> also can include a mud pump <b>118</b> or other circulating system
        positioned substantially at the surface and connected to the drill string
        <b>104</b>. Operation of the mud pump <b>118</b> can pump a drilling fluid
        through the one or more segments of drill pipe <b>106</b> and the BHA <b>108</b>
        of the drill string <b>104</b> to the drill bit <b>110</b>. That is, such
        a mud pump <b>118</b> (or another circulating system) can pump a drilling
        fluid down via the drill pipe <b>106</b> where the drilling fluid subsequently
        can exit the drill string <b>104</b> via orifices in the drill bit <b>110</b>
        and then flow upwardly to the surface through the annulus of the borehole
        <b>102</b>, as will be understood by those skilled in the art.<br />[0040]
        The drill bit <b>110</b>, the downhole drive controller <b>112</b>, a sensor
        assembly <b>126</b>, the drill pipe <b>106</b>, the top drive <b>114</b> (or
        other rotating system), the drawworks <b>116</b> (or other hoisting system),
        the mud pump <b>118</b> (or other circulating system), and any other drilling
        equipment (including those not illustrated in the example depicted in <figref
        idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 1</figref>) each can include one or more high
        sampling rate drilling parameter sensors. For example, a system <b>100</b>
        can include a first set of one or more sensors positioned along the drill
        string <b>104</b> thereby defining one or more downhole sensors <b>120</b>
        (sometimes called downhole parameter sensors). As illustrated, downhole sensors
        <b>120</b> are positioned on or at the BHA <b>108</b> but can be positioned
        in other locations, as well, and need not be positioned in the locations illustrated
        in the example depicted in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 1</figref>.
        A system <b>100</b> also can include a second set of one or more sensors positioned
        at the surface thereby defining one or more surface sensors <b>122</b>. As
        illustrated, surface sensors <b>122</b> are rig-mounted sensors and positioned
        at the top drive <b>114</b>, the drawworks <b>116</b>, and the mud pump <b>118</b>,
        but surface sensors <b>122</b> can be positioned at other locations, as well,
        and need not be positioned in the locations illustrated in the example depicted
        in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 1</figref>. A drilling parameter sensor,
        such as a downhole sensor <b>120</b> or a surface sensor <b>122</b>, can be
        any sensor operable to measure and provide raw data regarding at least one
        drilling parameter. Such a sensor can be mounted to any location available
        to sense the drilling parameter being monitored. Exemplary downhole sensors
        <b>120</b> can include (but are not limited to) direction measurement sensors,
        formation and wellbore evaluation sensors, sensors for determining the performance
        and physical condition of the BHA <b>108</b> and the drill bit <b>110</b>,
        mud motor parameter sensors, and sensors for determining the operating condition
        of the drill string <b>104</b>, as will be understood by those skilled in
        the art. Exemplary surface sensors <b>122</b> can include (but are not limited
        to) sensors for measuring variables related to the drill string <b>104</b>,
        such as load, torque, position, velocity, acceleration, and vibration, as
        well as sensors for measuring the fluid-related variables such as mud pressure,
        mud flow rate, and casing annular pressure and temperature, as will be understood
        by those skilled in the art.<br />[0041] A system <b>100</b> also can include
        a controller <b>130</b> positioned at the surface. A controller <b>130</b>
        can include one or more processors <b>132</b> and can be in communication
        with the downhole drive controller <b>112</b>, the top drive <b>114</b>, the
        drawworks <b>116</b>, the mud pump <b>118</b>, the one or more downhole sensors
        <b>120</b>, and the one or more surface sensors <b>122</b>, as illustrated
        in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 5</figref>, for example. A downhole
        communication hub <b>128</b> can be operable to collect data from different
        downhole sensors <b>120</b> and to transmit the collected data to the surface
        via a substantially online data transmission system <b>124</b>, in some circumstances,
        as illustrated in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 1</figref>, for example.
        The communications hub <b>128</b> also can be operable to receive operating
        instructions and control signals from the surface and relay those signals
        to one or more downhole sensors <b>120</b>, the downhole drive controller
        <b>112</b>, or other downhole tools. Such a substantially online data transmission
        system <b>124</b> can be any system suitable for the continuous transmission
        of measurement data, control commands, and other signals between downhole
        and the surface in real-time intervals of, for example, one second. Exemplary
        communication methods can include, but are not limited to, direct communication
        via electric signals along wired drill pipe (such as drill pipe <b>106</b>),
        mud-pulse telemetry, fiber optics, wireless signals, acoustic signals, and
        electromagnetic signals. For example, a data transmission system <b>124</b>
        can include a wired drill pipe <b>106</b> that in turn includes conductors
        coupled to the drill pipe <b>106</b> to provide a direct link between downhole
        and the surface. For example, in some instances, the controller <b>130</b>
        can be in communication with the downhole drive controller <b>112</b> and
        the one or more downhole sensors <b>120</b> through the one or more segments
        of drill pipe <b>106</b>, for example, as illustrated in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG.
        5</figref>. The data transmission system <b>124</b> can be connected to a
        surface data network (such as a network to which the controller <b>130</b>
        also is connected) via a surface communications link that can be integrated
        into a component such as a swivel, internal blow out preventer (IBOP) or into
        an instrumented saver sub coupled to the drill string <b>104</b>. Consequently,
        the controller <b>130</b> can be in communication with the data transmission
        system <b>124</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 1</figref>,
        for example.<br />[0042] A system <b>100</b> also can include a non-transitory
        computer-readable medium (such as a memory <b>136</b>) in communication with
        the one or more processors <b>132</b> of the controller <b>130</b>. The computer-readable
        medium <b>136</b> can have one or more computer programs stored thereon that,
        when executed by the one or more processors <b>132</b>, cause the system <b>100</b>
        to perform certain steps. For example, the system <b>100</b> can receive user
        input from a user, such as a directional driller, before performing additional
        steps. For instance, a system <b>100</b> can determine a target downhole torque
        on bit (DTOB) measurement value (that is, a targeted DTOB value to be measured
        by one or more downhole sensors <b>120</b>) responsive to receipt of user
        input from a user computing device in communication with the controller <b>130</b>.
        Further, for example, a user such as a directional driller can preselect a
        desired or target DTOB, or a target DTOB can be calculated from or otherwise
        determined based on some other preselected target value, such as ROP, WOB,
        or mud motor differential pressure. As an alternative or in addition to determining
        a target DTOB, a system <b>100</b> can determine a target downhole WOB (DWOB)
        measurement value (that is, a targeted DWOB value to be measured by one or
        more downhole sensors <b>120</b>) responsive to receipt of user input from
        the user computing device. A system <b>100</b> also can determine a target
        toolface orientation measurement value (that is, a targeted toolface orientation
        value to be measured by one or more downhole sensors <b>120</b>) responsive
        to receipt of the user input from the user computing device. As an alternative
        to a directional driller's preselection of these target values, any or all
        of the target values can be automatically computed by a drilling path planner,
        for example, in some circumstances.<br />[0043] Further, a system <b>100</b>
        can determine<b>6</b>\u2014responsive to one or more measurements at the one
        or more downhole sensors <b>120</b>\u2014an actual toolface orientation measurement
        value (that is, an actual toolface orientation value as measured by one or
        more downhole sensors <b>120</b>) and one or more of an actual DTOB measurement
        value (that is, an actual DTOB value as measured by one or more downhole sensors
        <b>120</b>) and an actual DWOB measurement value (that is, an actual DWOB
        value as measured by one or more downhole sensors <b>120</b>). For example,
        when a target DTOB measurement value has been determined, a system <b>100</b>
        can determine an actual DTOB measurement value; when a target DWOB has been
        determined, a system <b>100</b> can determine an actual DWOB measurement value.
        A system <b>100</b> also can determine\u2014responsive to one or more measurements
        at the one or more surface sensors <b>122</b>\u2014one or more of a current
        top drive operation measurement value, a current drawworks operation measurement
        value, and a current mud pump operation measurement value.<br />[0044] In
        addition, a system <b>100</b> can determine one or more of a DTOB error value
        and a DWOB error value. For example, when a target DTOB measurement value
        and an actual DTOB measurement value have been determined, a DTOB error value
        can be determined responsive to a comparison of the target DTOB measurement
        value to the actual DTOB measurement value. As an alternative to or in addition
        to determining a DTOB error value, for example, a DWOB error value can be
        determined\u2014responsive to a comparison of the target DWOB measurement
        value to the actual DWOB measurement value\u2014when a target DWOB measurement
        value and an actual DWOB measurement value have been determined. For example,
        the actual DTOB measurement value can be compared to the target DTOB measurement
        value to generate one or more of torque position error (E.sub.TOB), torque
        velocity error (\u0394E.sub.TOB), and torque acceleration error (\u0394.sup.2E.sub.TOB).
        Each of these error variables then can be scaled using a corresponding, in
        some instances nonlinear, scale function (such as, for example, SE.sub.TOB,
        S\u0394E.sub.TOB, and S\u0394.sup.2E.sub.TOB) that can determine the general
        sensitivity of control logic with respect to different values of the respective
        error variable. Likewise, the actual DWOB measurement value can be compared
        to the target DWOB measurement value to generate one or more of weight position
        error (E.sub.WOB), weight velocity error (\u0394E.sub.WOB), and weight acceleration
        error (\u0394.sup.2E.sub.WOB). Each of these error variables then can be scaled
        using a corresponding, in some instances nonlinear, scale function (such as,
        for example, SE.sub.WOB, S\u0394E.sub.WOB, and S\u0394.sup.2E.sub.WOB) that
        can determine the general sensitivity of control logic with respect to different
        values of the respective error variable. Each scale function can be determined
        analytically or using a knowledge-based approach.<br />[0045] In a similar
        manner, a system <b>100</b> can determine, responsive to a comparison of the
        target toolface orientation measurement value and the actual toolface orientation
        measurement value, a toolface orientation error value. For example, the actual
        toolface orientation measurement value can be compared to the target toolface
        orientation measurement value to generate one or more of position error E.sub.toolface,
        velocity error \u0394E.sub.toolface, and acceleration error \u0394.sup.2E.sub.toolface
        that then can be scaled using one or more (in some instances, nonlinear) scale
        functions, such as, for example, SE.sub.toolface, S\u0394E.sub.toolface, and
        S\u0394.sup.2E.sub.toolface.<br />[0046] A system <b>100</b> then can determine
        a control command for one or more of the top drive <b>114</b>, the drawworks
        <b>116</b>, and the mud pump <b>118</b> to correct each of the toolface orientation
        error value and the one or more of the DTOB error value and the DWOB error
        value responsive to the one or more of the current top drive operation measurement
        value, the current drawworks operation measurement value, and the current
        mud pump operation value, for example. A control command for the top drive
        <b>114</b> can be responsive to the current top drive operation measurement
        value, for instance, and a control command for the drawworks <b>116</b> can
        be responsive to the current drawworks operation measurement value. A control
        command for the mud pump <b>118</b> can be responsive to the current mud pump
        operation measurement value. Further, a system <b>100</b> can operate one
        or more of the top drive <b>114</b>, the drawworks <b>116</b>, and the mud
        pump <b>118</b> responsive to the control command, which can include one or
        more commands for the respective equipment. Operation of the drawworks <b>116</b>
        can include altering an ROP, and consequently a WOB, measurement value at
        the surface. Further, operation of the top drive <b>114</b> can include altering
        one or more of an angle of the drill string <b>104</b> with respect to the
        surface and a rotational speed of the drill string <b>104</b> within the borehole
        <b>102</b>. In addition, operation of the mud pump <b>118</b> can include
        altering a flow rate measurement value of the drilling fluid at the surface
        and, as a result, a fluid differential pressure (DiffP) at the surface. Consequently,
        operation of one or more of the top drive <b>114</b>, the drawworks <b>116</b>,
        and the mud pump <b>118</b> responsive to the control command thereby eventually
        can correct one or more of a toolface orientation of the drill string <b>104</b>,
        a DTOB, and a DWOB.<br />[0047] A system <b>100</b> also can perform data
        validation and reconciliation operations. The raw measurement data obtained
        by downhole sensors <b>120</b> and surface sensors <b>122</b> may not be fully
        correct as a result of measurement errors. Measurement errors can be categorized
        into two basic types: (1) random errors that can result from intrinsic sensor
        accuracy and (2) gross or systematic errors that can result from sensor calibration
        or faulty data transmission. Data validation and reconciliation operations
        can use filtering and estimation techniques to produce a single consistent
        set of data that represent the most likely value of a drilling parameter in
        real-time intervals of, for example, one second, while the raw data measured
        by the downhole sensors <b>120</b> and surface sensors <b>122</b> can exceed,
        for example, 50 Hz in sampling rate.<br />[0048] Exemplary data validation
        and reconciliation operations are illustrated, for instance, in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG.
        3</figref>. For example, in some circumstances, determining the actual toolface
        measurement value and the one or more of the actual DTOB measurement value
        and the actual DWOB measurement value can include validating <b>204</b> the
        one or more measurements at the one or more downhole sensors <b>120</b> (such
        as high sampling rate raw measurement data <b>202</b>) thereby to produce
        one or more validated measurements, as illustrated in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG.
        3</figref>, for example. Validating <b>204</b> the one or more measurements,
        which can have been sampled at a high rate, can provide certain improvements
        to the fitness, accuracy, and consistency of the measured values. Exemplary
        validation <b>204</b> operations can include, but are not limited to, examining
        data for consistency within a minimum and maximum expected range, discarding
        isolated data that deviate significantly from neighboring data measurements,
        cleaning data from spike faults when the rate of change in a gradient of measurement
        data over a specific period of time is much greater than expected, and monitoring
        stuck-at fault or frozen data where a series of measurement data remain with
        little or no variation for a period of time greater than expected.<br />[0049]
        Data validation and reconciliation operations also can include filtering <b>208</b>
        the validated data. For example, determining the actual toolface measurement
        value and the one or more of the actual DTOB measurement value and the actual
        DWOB measurement value also can include filtering <b>208</b> the one or more
        validated measurements thereby to produce one or more filtered measurements.
        Filtering <b>208</b> the one or more validated measurements can attenuate
        noise components of the measurement data. Exemplary filtering <b>208</b> methods
        can include, but are not limited to, taking the simple average of measured
        values over a specific time period, taking the moving average based on a specific
        moving time window, taking the exponentially weighted moving average that
        places greater importance on more recent data by discounting older data in
        an exponential manner, using local regression methods, and applying Savitzky-Golay
        filtering.<br />[0050] In addition, data validation and reconciliation operations
        can include reconciling <b>210</b> the filtered data. For instance, determining
        the actual toolface measurement value and the one or more of the actual DTOB
        measurement value and the actual DWOB measurement value further can include
        reconciling <b>210</b> the one or more filtered measurements thereby to produce
        one or more reconciled measurements. Reconciling <b>210</b> the one or more
        filtered measurements can correct random errors. From a statistical viewpoint,
        a main assumption in data reconciliation can be that no gross errors exist
        in the set of measurements, since gross errors can bias the reconciliation
        results and reduce the robustness of the reconciliation. Given n measurements
        for each variable in a set of m variables, data reconciliation can be expressed
        as an optimization problem of the following form:<br /><maths id=\\\"MATH-US-00001\\\"

        a measurement penalty function, a can be the variance of the random noise,
        y.sub.min and y.sub.max can be bounds on the measured variables, and F(y*)=0
        can represent a set of model equations <b>206</b> that express the general
        structure of the process as functions of reconciled data. Models <b>206</b>
        can have different levels of detail. For example, a model <b>206</b> can incorporate
        simple static material balances or advanced dynamic models.<br />[0051] Data
        validation and reconciliation operations also can include verifying <b>212</b>
        the reconciled data. For example, determining the actual toolface measurement
        value and the one or more of the actual DTOB measurement value and the actual
        DWOB measurement value also can include verifying <b>212</b> the one or more
        reconciled measurements thereby to produce one or more verified measurements.
        Result verification <b>212</b> can include, but is not limited to, measurement
        penalty analysis for determining the reliability of the reconciliation and
        bound checks to ensure that the reconciled values lie in a certain reasonable
        bounds. Result verification <b>212</b> can utilize analytical redundancy-based
        methods where an analytical model <b>206</b> is used to provide estimates
        of measured variables. This redundancy then can be used to detect any discrepancy
        or residual between the reconciled data and expected values. The analytical
        model <b>206</b> can be mathematical or knowledge-based. Exemplary model-based
        techniques can include, but are not limited to, an observer-based approach,
        a parity-space approach, a parameter identification-based approach, and a
        Kalman filter approach. After result verification <b>212</b>, data validation
        and reconciliation operations can include determining whether a valid result
        has been produced <b>214</b>. If a valid result has not been produced at step
        <b>214</b>, data reconciliation <b>210</b> can begin again. If a valid result
        has been produced at step <b>214</b>, however, data validation and reconciliation
        operations can proceed.<br />[0052] Data validation and reconciliation operations
        still further can include detecting <b>216</b> and remediating <b>220</b>
        gross errors in the verified data. For example, determining the actual toolface
        measurement value and the one or more of the actual DTOB measurement value
        and the actual DWOB measurement value can include remediating gross errors
        <b>220</b> in the one or more verified measurements thereby to produce the
        actual toolface measurement value and the one or more of the actual DTOB measurement
        value and the actual DWOB measurement value. Gross error detection <b>216</b>
        can indicate whether a gross error exists somewhere in the set of measurements
        at step <b>218</b>, for instance. In some circumstances, it can be assumed
        that the measurement errors are normally distributed. Then, if no gross errors
        exist in the set of measurements, each penalty term in f(y*) can be a random
        variable that is normally distributed with a mean equal to 0 and a variance
        equal to 1. By consequence, the measurement penalty function f(y*) can be
        a random variable which follows a chi-square distribution, since it is the
        sum of the square of normally distributed random variables. This can lead
        to an exemplary gross error detection approach that can include comparing
        the value of the objective function f(y*) with a given percentile P.sub.\u03B1
        of the probability density function of a chi-square distribution that can
        give an indication of whether a gross error exists. In such an example, if
        f(y*)\u2266P.sub.90, no gross errors exists with a 90% probability. Another
        exemplary gross error detection approach can include an individual test that
        compares each penalty term in f(y*) with the critical values of the normal
        distribution, and if the i-th penalty term is outside, for example, the 90%
        confidence interval of the normal distribution, then this measurement has
        a gross error with 90% probability. If no gross error exists somewhere in
        the set of measurements at step <b>218</b>, data validation and reconciliation
        operations can conclude and produce low sampling rate reconciled data <b>222</b>.
        If a gross error exists somewhere in the set of measurements at step <b>218</b>,
        gross remediation <b>220</b> can begin.<br />[0053] Gross error remediation
        <b>220</b> can include either discarding or relaxing measurement systematic
        errors that can bias the reconciliation results. In some circumstances, gross
        error remediation <b>220</b> can include determining the measurement data
        that are biased by a systematic error and discarding these data from the data
        set. The determination of the measurement to be discarded can be based on
        different kinds of penalty terms that express the degree to which the measured
        values deviate from the reconciled values. After gross errors have been discarded
        from the measurement data, data reconciliation <b>210</b> can be performed
        without these erroneous data that can spoil the reconciliation process. In
        some instances, the elimination can be repeated until no gross error exists
        in the set of reconciled data. Further, in some circumstances where it is
        not possible to determine which measurement data are responsible for systematic
        errors, gross error remediation <b>220</b> can rely on relaxing the estimate
        for the uncertainty of suspicious measurements so that the reconciled values
        lie within, for example, the 90% confidence interval.<br />[0054] In some
        circumstances, a control command can be responsive to one or more dynamic
        models of the drill string <b>104</b> within the borehole <b>102</b>. For
        example, the actual toolface orientation measurement value and the one or
        more of the actual DTOB measurement value and the actual DWOB measurement
        value can be used to estimate a drill string torsional compliance by analyzing
        the coupling dynamics between toolface angular displacement and DTOB. In some
        instances, the torsional compliance can be estimated using a drill string
        dynamic model that can be mathematical or knowledge-based. In other instances,
        the torsional compliance can be estimated by calculating the torsional compliance
        using actual observations at near past times that show the angular toolface
        displacements as a response to the downhole torque variations. In yet other
        instances, the torsional compliance can be estimated using a combination of
        a drill string dynamic model and actual observations, where the actual observations
        also can be used to update the drill string dynamic model.<br />[0055] Additionally,
        in some circumstances, the one or more computer programs, when executed by
        the one or more processors <b>132</b>, can cause the system <b>100</b> to
        estimate one or more future values of one or more downhole variables and to
        determine an optimal ROP of the drill string <b>104</b> responsive to a constrained
        optimization problem. Further, the control command can be responsive to the
        determined optimal ROP.<br />[0056] A control command can be for each of the
        top drive <b>114</b>, the drawworks <b>116</b>, and the mud pump <b>118</b>,
        or for any combination of them. In some circumstances, determining the control
        command can include using multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) core logic to determine
        the control command. Further, the MIMO core logic can include a plurality
        of decision rules, and each of the decision rules can be associated with one
        or more of: drawworks control, top drive control, and mud pump control. The
        outcome of each decision rule can be scaled by a weight factor that, according
        to drilling conditions, can determine the impact of that decision rule on
        the final control command. An aggregation logic then can be used to combine
        the weighted results from different decision rules and to produce quantifiable
        control command(s) for one or more of the top drive <b>114</b>, the drawworks
        <b>116</b>, and the mud pump <b>118</b>. Exemplary MIMO control logic can
        include, but is not limited to, a multivariable fuzzy logic controller and
        a multivariable model predictive controller.<br />[0057] Alternatively, in
        other circumstances, determining the control command can include using a first
        single-input, single-output (SISO) control logic to determine the control
        command for the top drive <b>114</b> and a second SISO control logic to determine
        the control command for the drawworks <b>116</b>. Exemplary SISO control logic
        can include, but is not limited to, a conventional proportional-integral-derivative
        (PID) controller and fuzzy logic controller, as will be understood by those
        skilled in the art.<br />[0058] For example, exemplary operations of a system
        or exemplary steps of a method <b>238</b> according to an embodiment are illustrated
        in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 4</figref>. As depicted, inputs can
        include desired (that is, target) downhole variables <b>240</b>, target toolface
        orientation <b>242</b>, and real-time information of drilling parameter variables
        <b>244</b>. Such real-time information of drilling parameter variables <b>244</b>
        can be obtained from one or more sensors, such as downhole sensors <b>120</b>
        or surface sensors <b>122</b>. Given the desired downhole variables <b>240</b>,
        one or more of a target DWOB and a target DTOB <b>246</b> can be determined.
        Further, given the real-time information of drilling parameter variables <b>244</b>,
        one or more of an actual DWOB and an actual DTOB <b>248</b>, as well as an
        actual toolface orientation <b>250</b>, can be determined. Given one or more
        of a target DWOB and a target DTOB <b>246</b> and one or more of an actual
        DWOB and an actual DTOB <b>248</b>, one or more of a DWOB scaled error and
        a DTOB scaled error <b>252</b> can be determined. Further, given the target
        toolface orientation <b>242</b> and the actual toolface orientation <b>250</b>,
        a toolface orientation scaled error <b>254</b> can be determined. A system
        states and disturbance observer <b>256</b> then can operate responsive to
        the actual toolface orientation <b>250</b> and one or more of the actual DWOB
        and the actual DTOB <b>248</b>. Further, a steering compliance estimator <b>258</b>
        can estimate the drill string torsional compliance responsive to the actual
        toolface orientation <b>250</b> and one or more of the actual DWOB and the
        actual DTOB <b>248</b>. Given the toolface orientation scaled error <b>254</b>,
        one or more of DWOB scaled error and DTOB scaled error <b>252</b>, estimate
        from the steering compliance estimator <b>258</b>, and input from the system
        states and disturbance observer <b>256</b>, multi-input multi-output (MIMO)
        control logic <b>260</b> can operate to determine a command <b>262</b> to
        send to one or more drilling equipment driving systems. Output of the MIMO
        control logic <b>260</b> also can feed back into the system states and disturbance
        observer <b>256</b> to be used for subsequent time-step calculations.<br />[0059]
        MIMO control logic can take into account the mutual effects among downhole
        torque, toolface orientation, top drive angle, and ROP, for example, as illustrated
        in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG.
        8</figref>. For instance, MIMO control logic <b>302</b> can utilize input
        from a user through a graphical user interface (GUI) or another application
        <b>304</b>, as well as input from one or more drilling sensors <b>306</b>,
        as illustrated in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 7</figref>. Input from
        a user through a graphical user interface (GUI) or another application <b>304</b>
        can include, for example, toolface orientation (TF) setpoint (that is, target
        toolface orientation), DTOB setpoint (that is, target DTOB), DWOB setpoint
        (that is, target DWOB), maximum ROP, maximum DiffP, slide length, maximum
        DTOB, and pipe tally, as will be understood by those skilled in the art. Further,
        input from one or more downhole drilling sensors <b>306</b> (such as downhole
        sensors <b>120</b>, for example) can include actual toolface orientation,
        actual DTOB, actual DWOB, and actual downhole differential pressure (DDiffP),
        as will be understood by those skilled in the art. Still further, input from
        one or more surface drilling sensors <b>306</b> (such as surface sensors <b>122</b>,
        for example) can include top drive (TD) orientation, ROP, WOB, DiffP, block
        height, hole depth, drill bit position, and survey, as will be understood
        by those skilled in the art. The output of the MIMO control logic <b>302</b>
        can include control commands to a top drive <b>308</b> regarding top drive
        orientation. Such control commands <b>308</b> can include one or more of angular
        position, throttle, and torque. Further, the output of the MIMO control logic
        <b>302</b> can include commands to a drawworks <b>310</b> regarding ROP. Such
        drawworks commands <b>310</b> can include drilling line payoff, WOB, and DiffP.
        Still further, the output of the MIMO control logic <b>302</b> can include
        commands to a mud pump <b>311</b> regarding mud flow that can include mud
        pump strokes. For example, a controller <b>318</b> using the MIMO core logic
        <b>302</b> can utilize target DTOB <b>314</b> and a target toolface orientation
        <b>316</b> as inputs to generate a surface ROP command <b>320</b> that can
        be sent to a drawworks <b>310</b>, as well as a surface top drive orientation
        command <b>322</b> that can be sent to a top drive <b>308</b>, as illustrated
        in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 8A</figref>, for example. Top drive
        <b>308</b> can provide feedback regarding top drive orientation <b>324</b>
        to the MIMO control logic <b>302</b>. In the drilling process <b>312</b>,
        the operation of the drawworks <b>310</b> and top drive <b>308</b> then can
        modify DTOB and toolface orientation to produce updated DTOB <b>328</b> and
        TF <b>330</b>. These updated drilling parameter measurements then can be fed
        back into the MIMO control logic <b>302</b> to be used for subsequent time-step
        calculations. In some instances, the controller <b>318</b> also can send a
        mud flow command <b>321</b> to a mud pump <b>309</b>, which can feed into
        the MIMO control logic <b>302</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG.
        8B</figref>, for example.<br />[0060] As an alternative to MIMO control logic
        <b>302</b>, two disjointed SISO controllers (one for each of top drive orientation
        and surface ROP) can be used, as illustrated in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG.
        9</figref>, for example. Each independent SISO controller can compare its
        setpoint with its corresponding downhole actual value and accordingly can
        generate a command to the process. For instance, a SISO control logic performed
        by a controller associated with TF <b>338</b> can use TF setpoint <b>316</b>
        and actual TF <b>334</b> as inputs to determine a command to send to a top
        drive <b>308</b>. Top drive can be used to compensate for error between the
        TF setpoint <b>316</b> and the actual TF <b>334</b>. That is, operation of
        the top drive can be used to correct toolface orientation. Similarly, a SISO
        control logic performed by a controller associated with DTOB <b>340</b> can
        use DTOB setpoint <b>314</b> and actual DTOB <b>336</b> as inputs to determine
        a command to send to a drawworks <b>310</b>. Drawworks can be used to compensate
        for error between the DTOB setpoint <b>314</b> and the actual DTOB <b>336</b>.
        That is, operation of the drawworks can be used to correct DTOB.<br />[0061]
        Another system according to an embodiment can include a controller <b>130</b>
        that includes one or more processors <b>132</b>. A system also can include
        a non-transitory computer-readable medium <b>136</b> in communication with
        the one or more processors <b>132</b> of the controller <b>130</b>. The computer-readable
        medium <b>136</b> can have one or more computer programs stored thereon that,
        when executed by the one or more processors <b>132</b>, cause the system to
        determine an actual downhole torque on bit (DTOB) measurement value and an
        actual toolface orientation measurement value for a drill string <b>104</b>
        positioned in a borehole <b>102</b> for a hydrocarbon well. As an alternative
        to or in addition to determining the actual DTOB measurement value, a system
        can determine a DWOB measurement value; in such circumstances, steps performed
        by the system related to DTOB can instead be related to DWOB. A system also
        can determine, responsive to a comparison of a target DTOB measurement value
        and the actual DTOB measurement value, a DTOB error value. As an alternative
        to or in addition to determining the DTOB error value, a system can determine
        a DWOB error value. Further, a system can determine, responsive to a comparison
        of a target toolface orientation measurement value and the actual toolface
        orientation measurement value, a toolface orientation error value. In addition,
        a system can determine a control command for one or more of a top drive <b>114</b>
        and a drawworks <b>116</b> responsive to the DTOB error value (and/or the
        DWOB error value) and the toolface orientation error value. A system further
        can operate one or more of the top drive <b>114</b> and the drawworks <b>116</b>
        responsive to the control command thereby to correct a toolface orientation
        of the drill string <b>104</b>.<br />[0062] In some instances, determining
        the actual DTOB measurement value can include determining an actual DWOB measurement
        value. Additionally, the actual DTOB measurement value can be a sensor measurement
        value, and the actual DWOB measurement value can be a sensor measurement value,
        as well. Further, determining the actual DTOB measurement value and the actual
        toolface orientation measurement value can be responsive to one or more of:
        (a) one or more measurements at one or more sensors <b>120</b> positioned
        within the borehole <b>102</b> and (b) an appropriate estimator, such as a
        Kalman filter. For example, DTOB and toolface orientation can be obtained
        or estimated from measurements by downhole sensors <b>120</b> or estimated
        by an appropriate estimator (such as a Kalman filter, for example) or a combination
        of both.<br />[0063] The controller <b>130</b> can be in communication with
        the one or more sensors <b>120</b> through one or more segments of wired drill
        pipe <b>106</b>, in some circumstances. Further, a system also can determine
        a current top drive operation measurement value and a current drawworks operation
        measurement value, and the control command can be responsive to the current
        top drive operation measurement value and the current drawworks operation
        measurement value. In some instances, the control command can be for one or
        more of the top drive <b>114</b>, the drawworks <b>116</b>, and a mud pump
        <b>118</b>. The one or more computer programs, when executed by the one or
        more processors <b>132</b>, further can cause the system to determine a current
        mud pump operation measurement value and to operate the mud pump <b>118</b>
        responsive to the control command thereby to correct a toolface orientation
        of the drill string <b>104</b>.<br />[0064] Additionally, in some circumstances,
        determining the actual DTOB measurement value and the actual toolface measurement
        value can include validating the one or more measurements at the one or more
        sensors <b>120</b> thereby to produce one or more validated measurements and
        filtering the one or more validated measurements thereby to produce one or
        more filtered measurements. Determining the actual DTOB measurement value
        and the actual toolface measurement value also can include reconciling the
        one or more filtered measurements thereby to produce one or more reconciled
        measurements and verifying the one or more reconciled measurements thereby
        to produce one or more verified measurements. Further, determining the actual
        DTOB measurement value and the actual toolface measurement value can include
        remediating gross errors in the one or more verified measurements thereby
        to produce the actual DTOB measurement value and the actual toolface measurement
        value.<br />[0065] Operation of the drawworks <b>116</b> can include altering
        a weight on bit (WOB) measurement value at a surface of the borehole, and
        operation of the top drive <b>114</b> can include altering one or more of
        an angle of the drill string <b>104</b> with respect to the surface and a
        rotational speed of the drill string <b>104</b> within the borehole <b>102</b>.<br
        />[0066] Further, the control command can be responsive to one or more dynamic
        models of the drill string <b>104</b> within the borehole <b>102</b>, and
        operation of the drawworks <b>116</b> can control ROP of the drill string
        <b>104</b>. A system also can estimate one or more future values of one or
        more downhole variables and determine an optimal ROP of the drill string <b>104</b>
        responsive to a constrained optimization problem. In addition, the control
        command can be responsive to the determined optimal ROP of the drill string
        <b>104</b>.<br />[0067] In some circumstances, the one or more computer programs,
        when executed by the one or more processors <b>132</b>, further can cause
        the system determine the target toolface orientation measurement value responsive
        to receipt of user input from a user computing device in communication with
        the controller <b>130</b> and to determine the target DTOB measurement value
        (and/or the target DWOB measurement value) responsive to receipt of the user
        input from the user computing device. Such user input can include, for example,
        one or more of: a preselected DTOB measurement value, a preselected ROP, a
        preselected DWOB, and a preselected mud motor differential pressure.<br />[0068]
        For instance, a user such as a directional driller can select a desired target
        DTOB measurement value directly. A target DTOB measurement value also can
        be automatically computed, such as by drilling application software, for example.
        That is, user input can include a preselected DTOB measurement value.<br />[0069]
        Further, user input can include a preselected ROP. A desired ROP can be selected
        by a directional driller or other user, for example, and the target DTOB measurement
        value can be determined as a function of the desired ROP:<br /><br/><?in-line-formulae

        pressure limit, and a vibration limit.<br />[0074] In addition, user input
        can include a preselected DWOB. The desired DWOB can be used to compute the
        desired DTOB as a function of the desired DWOB:<br /><br/><?in-line-formulae
        description=\\\"In-line Formulae\\\" end=\\\"lead\\\"?>DTOB.sub.desired<i>=f</i>(DWOB.sub.desired)<?in-line-formulae

        limits<br />[0079] User input still further can include a preselected mud
        motor differential pressure. A desired mud motor differential pressure can
        be used to compute the desired DTOB as a function of the desired DiffP:<br
        /><br/><?in-line-formulae description=\\\"In-line Formulae\\\" end=\\\"lead\\\"?>DTOB.sub.desired<i>=f</i>(\u0394P.sub.desired)<?in-line-formulae

        as a function of two or more of desired ROP, desired DWOB, desired DiffP,
        and desired drill bit RPM, subject to safety operational limits.<br />[0085]
        In addition to systems, embodiments of the invention can include methods to
        control directional drilling in borehole drilling for hydrocarbon wells. For
        example, a method according to an embodiment can include determining an actual
        DTOB measurement value (and/or an actual DWOB measurement value) and an actual
        toolface orientation measurement value for a drill string <b>104</b> positioned
        in a borehole <b>102</b> for a hydrocarbon well. A method also can include
        determining, responsive to a comparison of a target DTOB measurement value
        (and/or a target DWOB measurement value) and the actual DTOB measurement value
        (and/or the actual DWOB measurement value), a DTOB error value (and/or a DWOB
        error value). Further, a method can include determining, responsive to a comparison
        of a target toolface orientation measurement value and the actual toolface
        orientation measurement value, a toolface orientation error value. In addition,
        a method can include determining a control command for one or more of a top
        drive <b>114</b> and a drawworks <b>116</b> responsive to the DTOB error value
        (and/or the DWOB error value) and the toolface orientation error value. A
        method still further can include operating one or more of the top drive <b>114</b>
        and the drawworks <b>116</b> responsive to the control command thereby to
        correct a toolface orientation of the drill string <b>104</b>.<br />[0086]
        In some circumstances, determining the actual DTOB measurement value can include
        determining an actual DWOB measurement value. Additionally, determining the
        actual DTOB measurement value (and/or the actual DWOB measurement value) and
        the actual toolface orientation measurement value can be responsive to one
        or more of: (a) one or more measurements at one or more sensors <b>120</b>
        positioned within the borehole <b>102</b> and (b) a Kalman filter. Further,
        a method also can include receiving the one or more measurements from the
        one or more sensors <b>102</b> through one or more segments of wired drill
        pipe <b>106</b> and determining a current top drive operation measurement
        value and a current drawworks operation measurement value. The control command
        can be responsive to the current top drive operation measurement value and
        the current drawworks operation measurement value. The control command can
        be for one or more of the top drive, the drawworks, and a mud pump, and the
        method also can include determining a current mud pump operation measurement
        value and operating the mud pump responsive to the control command thereby
        to correct a toolface orientation of the drill string <b>104</b>. Determining
        the actual DTOB measurement value (and/or the actual DWOB measurement value)
        and the actual toolface measurement value can include validating the one or
        more measurements at the one or more sensors <b>120</b> thereby to produce
        one or more validated measurements and filtering the one or more validated
        measurements thereby to produce one or more filtered measurements. Additionally,
        determining the actual DTOB measurement value (and/or the actual DWOB measurement
        value) and the actual toolface measurement value can include reconciling the
        one or more filtered measurements thereby to produce one or more reconciled
        measurements and verifying the one or more reconciled measurements thereby
        to produce one or more verified measurements. Determining the actual DTOB
        measurement value (and/or the actual DWOB measurement value) and the actual
        toolface measurement value also can include remediating gross errors in the
        one or more verified measurements thereby to produce the actual DTOB measurement
        value (and/or the actual DWOB measurement value) and the actual toolface measurement
        value.<br />[0087] Additionally, operation of the drawworks <b>116</b> can
        include altering a WOB measurement value at a surface of the borehole, and
        operation of the top drive <b>114</b> can include altering one or more of
        an angle of the drill string <b>104</b> with respect to the surface and a
        rotational speed of the drill string <b>104</b> within the borehole <b>102</b>.
        A method also can include determining the target DTOB measurement value (and/or
        the target DWOB measurement value) responsive to receipt of user input from
        a user computing device. The user input can include one or more of: a preselected
        DTOB measurement value, a preselected rate of penetration, a preselected DWOB,
        and a preselected mud motor differential pressure. A method also can include
        determining the target toolface orientation measurement value responsive to
        receipt of the user input from the user computing device.<br />[0088] Further,
        the control command can be responsive to one or more dynamic models of the
        drill string <b>104</b> within the borehole <b>102</b>, and operation of the
        drawworks <b>116</b> can control a ROP of the drill string <b>102</b>. A method
        also can include estimating one or more future values of one or more downhole
        variables and determining an optimal ROP of the drill string <b>104</b> responsive
        to a constrained optimization problem. Additionally, the control command can
        be responsive to the determined optimal ROP of the drill string <b>104</b>.<br
        />[0089] Embodiments also can include non-transitory computer-readable media
        to control directional drilling in borehole drilling for hydrocarbon wells.
        For example, a non-transitory computer-readable medium according to an embodiment
        can have computer-executable instructions stored thereon that can be executed
        by one or more processors to perform a method, such as one or more of the
        methods described herein.<br />[0090] Another method according to an embodiment
        to control directional drilling in borehole drilling for hydrocarbon wells
        can include providing a directional drilling monitor application to a user
        on a user computing device <b>170</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG.
        6</figref>, for example. Such a user computing device <b>170</b> can include,
        for example, a desktop computer, a laptop, a smartphone, a tablet computer,
        or a personal digital assistant, among other examples. Further, the user computing
        device <b>170</b> can be positioned and located at or near a drilling site,
        but the user computing device <b>170</b> also can be positioned at a remote
        location, such as an operator's office facility or remote operations center,
        for example, or at any other location. A user computing device <b>170</b>
        can include one or more processors <b>172</b>, one or more memories <b>174</b>
        (such as non-transitory computer-readable media) in communication with the
        one or more processors <b>172</b>, and one or more displays <b>176</b> in
        communication with the one or more processors <b>172</b>, for example.<br
        />[0091] A method also can include receiving measurements at a server <b>178</b>
        from one or more sensors <b>120</b> positioned in a borehole <b>102</b> for
        a hydrocarbon well. The borehole <b>102</b> can extend from a surface into
        a subsurface of the hydrocarbon well. The server <b>178</b> can be positioned
        and located at the drilling site, but the server <b>178</b> also can be positioned
        at a remote location, similarly to the user computing device <b>170</b>. Further,
        the server <b>178</b> and the user computer device <b>170</b> can be positioned
        at the same location, either at the drilling site or at a remote site, or
        the server <b>178</b> and the user computer device <b>170</b> can be positioned
        at different locations from each other, including two separate remote locations.
        The server <b>178</b> can include one or more processors <b>180</b> and a
        memory <b>182</b> (such as a non-transitory computer-readable medium) that
        stores the user's preferences for information format and is in communication
        with the one or more processors <b>180</b>. The server <b>178</b> can be in
        communication with the user computing device <b>170</b>, a top drive <b>114</b>,
        a drawworks <b>116</b>, and the one or more sensors <b>120</b>.<br />[0092]
        The one or more processors <b>180</b> of the server <b>178</b> can operate
        to perform a series of steps. For example, the one or more processors <b>180</b>
        can operate to determine, responsive to the received measurements, an actual
        DTOB measurement value and an actual toolface orientation measurement value
        for a drill string <b>104</b> positioned in the borehole <b>102</b>. The one
        or more processors <b>180</b> also can operate to determine a target DTOB
        measurement value responsive to receipt of user input from the user computing
        device <b>170</b>. Further, the one or more processors <b>180</b> can operate
        to determine a target toolface orientation measurement value responsive to
        receipt of the user input from the user computing device <b>170</b>. The one
        or more processors <b>180</b> also can operate to determine, responsive to
        a comparison of the target DTOB measurement value and the actual DTOB measurement
        value, a DTOB error value. In addition, the one or more processors <b>180</b>
        can operate to determine, responsive to a comparison of the target toolface
        orientation measurement value and the actual toolface orientation measurement
        value, a toolface orientation error value. Still further, the one or more
        processors <b>180</b> can operate to determine a control command for one or
        more of a top drive <b>114</b> and a drawworks <b>116</b> to correct each
        of the DTOB error value and the toolface orientation error value responsive
        to a current top drive operation measurement value and a current drawworks
        operation measurement value. The one or more processors <b>180</b> also can
        operate to generate a directional drilling alert from the actual DTOB measurement
        value, the actual toolface orientation measurement value, and the control
        command. Further, the one or more processors <b>180</b> can operate to format
        the directional drilling alert according to the information format and transmit
        the formatted directional drilling alert to the user computing device <b>170</b>
        thereby to indicate a planned change in drill string orientation. In addition,
        the one or more processors <b>180</b> can operate one or more of the top drive
        <b>114</b> and the drawworks <b>116</b> responsive to the control command
        thereby to correct a toolface orientation of the drill string <b>104</b>.
        Operation of the drawworks <b>116</b> can include altering a WOB measurement
        value at the surface, and operation of the top drive <b>114</b> can include
        altering one or more of an angle of the drill string <b>104</b> with respect
        to the surface and a rotational speed of the drill string <b>104</b> within
        the borehole <b>102</b>.<br />[0093] In some instances, a system according
        to an embodiment can include one or more modules. A module can include a set
        of instructions or operations or one or more portions of a software application
        that relate to and operate to effect certain functions of the software, for
        example, as will be understood by those skilled in the art. Computer-executable
        instructions that make up a software application can be stored on a non-transitory
        computer-readable medium, for example, such as those described herein. For
        example, as depicted in the exemplary system diagram illustrated in <figref
        idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 2</figref>, an autonomous direct controlled steering
        system <b>150</b> according to an embodiment can be configured to automate
        directional drilling operations where a drill string <b>104</b> is guided
        along a non-vertical path. In operation, the high sampling rate drilling parameter
        sensors <b>168</b> (which can include downhole sensors <b>120</b> and surface
        sensors <b>122</b>, for example) and a downhole drive controller <b>112</b>
        can provide data to a data validation and reconciliation module <b>162</b>
        via the substantially online data transmission system <b>164</b> (such as
        data transmission system <b>124</b>), which can make direct control possible.
        Such a data validation and reconciliation module <b>162</b> can process the
        raw data and provide the refined information to an autonomous direct control
        system <b>152</b>, which can evaluate the real-time performance of the steering
        operation and accordingly provide online operating commands to one or more
        drilling equipment driving systems <b>166</b>. The one or more drilling equipment
        driving systems <b>166</b> can include the top drive <b>114</b>, the drawworks
        <b>116</b>, the mud pump <b>118</b>, as well as controllers associated with
        any of the equipment used during drilling. A drilling equipment driving system
        <b>166</b> can be a drive control interface or software of any drilling equipment
        or apparatus that can either directly or indirectly affect one or more drilling
        parameters. Further, such equipment can be mounted in downhole or at the surface.
        Exemplary rig-mounted equipment includes, but is not limited to, rotating
        system equipment (such as one or more top drives <b>114</b>), hoisting system
        equipment (such as one or more drawworks <b>116</b>), and circulating system
        equipment (such as one or more mud pumps <b>118</b>). Exemplary downhole equipment
        can include any downhole active or adjustable devices such as mud motors,
        turbines, bent subs or whipstocks, adjustable stabilizers, agitators, and
        rotary steerable systems.<br />[0094] Some or all of the data validation and
        reconciliation operations described above, including some or all of those
        illustrated in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 3</figref>, can be performed
        by a data validation and reconciliation module <b>162</b>, for example. In
        such an example, <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 3</figref> can depict
        an exemplary workflow of the data validation and reconciliation module <b>162</b>.<br
        />[0095] Further, the autonomous direct control system <b>152</b> can perform
        some of the other operations described above. The autonomous direct control
        system <b>152</b> can be in bidirectional communication with a common operation
        infrastructure, including an operator station <b>160</b>. The operator station
        <b>160</b> can provide a user interface that can be accessed by a directional
        driller on the rig or in a remote location, for example. The operator station
        <b>160</b> also can provide a location for providing manual input to the control
        system <b>152</b> and for manual override of the control system <b>152</b>
        if needed. The control station <b>160</b> can provide a visual representation
        of the operation of the autonomous direct control system <b>152</b>, including
        the status of one or more drilling equipment <b>166</b> and a real-time representation
        of data received from the drilling parameter sensors <b>168</b>. The BHA <b>108</b>
        can be coupled to and in communication with a rotating system (such as a top
        drive <b>114</b>), a hoisting system (such as a drawworks <b>116</b>), or
        other surface equipment via a drill pipe <b>106</b>. Under an autonomous direct
        control operation, the raw data collected by the high sampling rate drilling
        parameter sensors <b>168</b> can be relayed to the data validation and reconciliation
        module <b>162</b> via the online data transmission system <b>164</b>. The
        drilling parameter sensors <b>168</b> also can be configured to receive operating
        instructions (in addition to sending measurements) via the online transmission
        system <b>164</b>. The raw data collected by the drilling parameter sensors
        <b>168</b> can be processed online by the data validation and reconciliation
        module <b>162</b> to obtain refined information useful for decision-making
        by the autonomous direct control system <b>152</b>.<br />[0096] An autonomous
        direct control system <b>152</b> can include one or more components referred
        to herein as mechanisms, such as a primary control mechanism <b>154</b>, a
        secondary control mechanism <b>156</b>, and a tertiary control mechanism <b>158</b>.
        A mechanism as described can include a set of instructions or operations or
        a portion of a software application that relates to and operates to effect
        certain functions of the software, for example, as will be understood by those
        skilled in the art. Computer-executable instructions that make up a software
        application can be stored on a non-transitory computer-readable medium, for
        example, such as those described herein. In some instances, the autonomous
        direct control system <b>152</b> depicted in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG.
        2</figref> can include only a primary control mechanism <b>154</b> that provides
        online operating commands to one or more drilling equipment driving systems
        <b>166</b> in order to ensure stability and robustness of automated directional
        drilling against a wide range of external disturbances, measurement uncertainties,
        and unknown environmental conditions. Such a primary control mechanism <b>154</b>
        can be fully implemented either in a downhole device or in a surface application.
        In either case, the communication between the surface and the downhole can
        be enabled by an online data transmission system <b>164</b>.<br />[0097] Some
        or all of the operations described above, including some or all of those illustrated
        in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 4</figref>, can be performed by such
        a primary control mechanism <b>154</b>, for example. In such an example, <figref
        idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 4</figref> can depict a simplified block diagram
        and an exemplary workflow of the primary control mechanism <b>154</b>. More
        specifically, <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 4</figref> can illustrate
        an exemplary workflow of the primary control mechanism <b>154</b> utilizing
        control logic related to a disturbance rejection method. Such disturbance
        rejection control logic can receive a scaled deviation error of toolface orientation
        <b>254</b> and one or more of scaled deviation errors of DTOB and DWOB <b>252</b>,
        along with drill string torsional compliance data, and accordingly can issue
        operating commands <b>262</b> via an output interface to one or more drilling
        equipment and apparatuses, including rotating system equipment such as top
        drives, hoisting system equipment such as drawworks, circulating system equipment
        such as mud pumps, and downhole RSS equipment. The control logic can be a
        multivariable (also called multi-input multi-output) control method with a
        model-independent core logic <b>262</b>. In some instances, such active disturbance
        rejection control logic can include one or more proportional-integral-derivative
        (PID) controllers, where the input to each PID controller can be a function
        of the scaled deviation errors and drill string torsional compliance data.
        Further, in some circumstances, the control logic can be associated with a
        fuzzy logic controller. An extension of a system model with an additional
        and fictitious state variable that represents everything that a user does
        not include in a mathematical description of the plant of interest can be
        used, as well. A plant, as will be understood by those skilled in the art,
        can include a system on which the disturbance control logic can operate, including
        drilling equipment (such as sensors, a drawworks, a top drive, and a mud pump,
        for example) and information transmitted to and from the drilling equipment.
        This virtual state (sum of internal and external disturbances, sometimes denoted
        as a \u201Ctotal disturbance\u201D) can be estimated online with a state observer
        and used in the control signal in order to decouple unknown uncertainties
        from the rest of the drilling system. This disturbance rejection feature can
        allow the user to treat the considered system with a simpler model, since
        the negative effects of modeling uncertainty can be compensated in real time.
        As a result, it can eliminate a need for a precise analytical description
        of the system, as one can assume the unknown parts of dynamics as the internal
        disturbance in the drilling system. Robustness and the adaptive ability of
        this method can provide an advantageous solution in scenarios where the full
        knowledge of the drilling system is not available.<br />[0098] An additional
        method according to an embodiment is illustrated in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG.
        10</figref>, for example. Measurements can be taken <b>350</b> from one or
        more downhole sensors <b>120</b> positioned along a drill string <b>104</b>,
        including measurements related to toolface orientation, downhole WOB (DWOB),
        downhole torque (Dtorque), and downhole differential pressure (Ddiff P). These
        measurements can be used to determine toolface orientation, which can be filtered
        <b>352</b> to generate a toolface estimate <b>354</b>. The toolface estimate
        <b>354</b> and a target toolface <b>316</b> can be summed <b>356</b>, then
        optimization criteria can be selected <b>358</b>. A torque command can be
        processed <b>360</b> and used as an input to a state space MIMO <b>362</b>.
        The state space MIMO <b>362</b> can include inputs of downhole bit torque,
        surface torque, downhole WOB, and downhole differential pressure. The state
        space MIMO <b>362</b> further can utilize as given inputs the length of the
        drill pipe, the type and size of the drill pipe, and one or more optimizing
        parameters. Outputs of the state space MIMO <b>362</b> can include line payoff,
        pipe rotation, and pump speed. Line payoff, drill pipe incremental rotation,
        and bit speed then can be sent to one or more controllers <b>364</b>, which
        can control operation of a drawworks, a pipe rotator (which can be a subset
        of a top drive control), and a pump controller.<br />[0099] Further, an additional
        system according to an embodiment is illustrated in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG.
        11</figref>, for example. Such a system can allow input from one or more users
        <b>372</b> through a user interface <b>374</b>. The user interface <b>374</b>
        can be in communication, through input/output services <b>376</b>, with surface
        instrumentation <b>378</b>, downhole instrumentation <b>382</b>, a rig control
        system <b>384</b>, data services <b>386</b>, and an application engine <b>380</b>.
        The application engine <b>380</b> can perform one or more of the operations
        or methods described herein. Further, the data services <b>386</b> can be
        in communication with configuration storage <b>388</b> and data logging <b>390</b>.<br
        />[0100] Embodiments of the invention thus can provide autonomous direct controlled
        steering in directional drilling that can include: a drilling parameter sensor
        with high sampling rate; a data validation and reconciliation module that
        can be communicatively coupled to the drilling parameter sensor through an
        online data transmission system and can generate processed data from the raw
        data gathered by the drilling parameter sensor; a primary control mechanism
        that can enhance stability and robustness of automated directional drilling
        by online commanding a drilling equipment driving system; a secondary control
        mechanism that adaptively can guide the primary control mechanism based on
        a drill string dynamic model; and a tertiary control mechanism that can determine
        an optimal rate of penetration by online solving a constrained optimization
        problem.<br />[0101] Consequently, embodiments of the invention can provide
        drilling optimization software to automate and optimize directional drilling
        practices to set and continuously maintain downhole equipment orientation
        while also optimizing drilling rate of penetration. Such a software application
        can achieve this automation by applying downhole measurements of torque, WOB,
        and differential pressure to continuously control surface pipe rotary and
        drawworks systems. Further, such a software application also can enable automated
        directional drilling to be performed and monitored from a remote operations
        center.<br />[0102] In the various embodiments of the invention described

        of the invention relate to hydrocarbon well drilling and, more specifically,
        to systems, computer-readable media, interfaces, and methods to control directional
        drilling.<br />BACKGROUND<br />[0003] In the field of oil and gas exploration
        and production, hydrocarbon wells may be drilled to recover hydrocarbons from
        subterranean formations. Such wells may be constructed by drilling a borehole
        into a formation using a rotary drill bit attached to a remote end of a drill
        string. A fluid that may be referred to as \u201Cdrilling mud\u201D may be
        circulated down through the drill string to lubricate the drill bit and carry
        drill cuttings out of the wellbore as the fluid returns to the surface at
        the well site. The particular methods and equipment used to construct a particular
        well may vary extensively based on the environment and formation in which
        the well is being drilled. Many different types of equipment and systems may
        be used in the construction of wells, including, but not limited to, a rotating
        system for turning the drill bit, a hoisting system for lifting the drill
        string, a circulating system for managing the drilling fluid, pressure management
        equipment for controlling wellbore pressure, a directional drilling and steering
        system for non-vertical drilling, and several downhole tools.<br />[0004]
        Some oil and gas wells may not be drilled vertically straight but rather at
        a deviated angle from vertical and in a specified direction. Specific drilling
        methods may be deployed to deviate these wells to direct them in the desired
        well path. Such methods, known collectively as \u201Cdirectional drilling,\u201D
        may require drilling personnel to orient downhole equipment to drill the well
        in the desired well path. The overall directional drilling operation may be
        directed by a specific person known as the \u201Cdirectional driller.\u201D<br
        />[0005] \u201CSliding\u201D may describe drilling with a mud motor rotating
        the bit downhole without rotating the drill string from the surface. This
        operation may be conducted when a bottom hole assembly has been fitted with
        a bent sub or a bent housing mud motor, or both, for directional drilling.
        Sliding may be a predominant method to build and control or correct hole angle
        in modern and conventional directional drilling operations.<br />[0006] A
        precise drill bit direction may be essential to drilling a borehole successfully,
        particularly in controlled steering and directional drilling. Achieving a
        precise drill bit direction may be obtained either by steering while sliding,
        which orients the bent segment of a downhole mud motor from the surface, or
        by steering while rotating, which utilizes a downhole rotary steerable system
        (RSS).<br />[0007] A drill bit direction may be determined by a toolface orientation
        in three-dimensional space. Downhole toolface orientation is a complex function
        of several drilling variables including, but not limited to, weight on bit
        (WOB), torque on bit (TOB), drill bit torsional speed (rotations per minute
        or RPM), mud motor differential pressure, rate of penetration (ROP), drill
        bit type, formation lithology, and the angular position of a rotating system.
        The overall efficiency of directional drilling, especially in the slide drilling,
        may depend on analyzing all of these variables and accordingly applying torque
        or angle corrections to the drill bit.<br />[0008] Current directional drilling
        practices may require the directional driller to verbally translate desired
        downhole equipment orientation to the rig's \u201Cdriller,\u201D a person
        who may control the machinery on a rig floor that is used to drill the well.
        The driller then may apply and maintain the required settings of drilling
        machinery located on the drilling rig floor. These directional drilling methods
        may result in human error that consequentially may increase rig non-productive
        time, lower drilling efficiency, and drive up overall directional drilling
        cost.<br />SUMMARY<br />[0009] Applicant has recognized problems associated
        with drill bit direction in directional drilling and advantageously provides
        solutions to these problems in fields such as drilling control and automation
        systems. Applicant has recognized that, in the presence of latency or a delay
        in receiving toolface orientation information, a controlled steering process
        can lead to undesirable back-and-forth wandering of the drill bit, which can
        result in high trajectory tortuosity. Further, Applicant has recognized that
        substantially online transmission of downhole data while drilling can provide
        new and unique opportunities for automated drilling operations by eliminating
        or dramatically reducing the communication delay between downhole and the
        surface. Wired drill pipe technology, for example, can enable such data transmission.
        This online data transmission can enable real-time monitoring, optimization,
        and autonomous direct control solutions and systems for three-dimensional
        directional drilling. Applicant advantageously has recognized a need in the
        art for methods, systems, and apparatuses that can provide these capabilities.<br
        />[0010] Further, a measure of efficiency in a drilling operation can include
        how fast a borehole can be drilled, which is directly related to rate of penetration
        (ROP). An optimal ROP can be a function of several drilling variables including,
        but not limited to, weight on bit (WOB), torque on bit (TOB), drill bit torsional
        speed (rotations per minute or RPM), drilling fluid hydraulics, toolface orientation,
        drill bit type, and formation lithology. Increasing ROP can decrease the life
        of the drill bit, which in turn can increase drilling time because shorter
        drill bit life can necessitate more frequent replacements of the drill bit.
        An inappropriate ROP also can lead to such issues as vibration and sticking
        that can eventually slow down the drilling process. Applicant therefore has
        recognized that an autonomous directional drilling solution can optimize ROP
        while steering.<br />[0011] Applicant advantageously provides systems, methods,
        computer-readable media, interfaces, and apparatuses for drilling control
        and automation systems. More specifically, embodiments of systems, methods,
        computer-readable media, interfaces, and apparatuses for autonomous, closed-loop
        directional drilling that can interface with a plurality of drilling sensors
        and communication systems to support a variety of autonomous real-time direct
        control functions using a common operation infrastructure are provided. The
        common operation infrastructure can be configured to acquire data from a variety
        of sources and sensors, communicate that data with a variety of control functions
        and information interfaces, and provide substantially online operating instructions
        to drilling equipment and systems, all in real time and at a high data rate,
        which can be enabled by wired drill pipe and a surface data network, for example.
        Embodiments thus can enable an operator (or another application) to determine
        slide drilling with a preselected target downhole TOB (DTOB) and/or downhole
        WOB (DWOB) and under a specific toolface orientation.<br />[0012] Directional
        drilling conceptually can include orienting the bit in the desired direction
        and executing a series of slide drill and rotate drill iterations. Orienting
        can be accomplished by rotating and holding the axial position of the drill
        string so that the bent sub or bent housing, which has a small angle offset,
        orients the new direction in which to drill. Without turning the drill string,
        the bit can be rotated with a mud motor and drill in the direction it points.
        With steerable motors, when the desired wellbore direction is attained, the
        entire drill string can be rotated and drill straight rather than at an angle.
        By controlling the amount of hole drilled in the sliding versus the rotating
        mode, the wellbore trajectory can be controlled precisely.<br />[0013] Advantages
        of embodiments of the invention can include that a feedback control can obtain
        direct data at downhole. Because of this, the control can take into account
        unforeseen disturbances due to, for example, frictional, hydraulic, and lithology
        changes. By altering one or more surface drilling parameters immediately once
        deviations are observed in toolface orientation and downhole TOB, regardless
        of what caused the deviation, embodiments can deliver slide drilling with
        higher accuracy and stability.<br />[0014] For example, embodiments can include
        systems and methods to control directional drilling in borehole drilling for
        hydrocarbon wells. A system according to an embodiment can include, for example,
        a drill string positioned within a borehole for a hydrocarbon well. The borehole
        can extend from a surface into subterranean material. Further, a drill string
        can include one or more substantially cylindrical segments of drill pipe,
        a wire drilling line, a bottom hole assembly, a drill bit, and a downhole
        drive controller to control rotation of the drill bit. A system also can include
        a top drive positioned substantially at the surface and connected to the drill
        string. Operation of the top drive can rotate the drill string within the
        borehole. Additionally, a system can include a drawworks positioned substantially
        at the surface and connected to the drill string. The drawworks can include
        a substantially cylindrical spool around which the wire drilling line is wound,
        and the drawworks also can include a pulley and a brake to inhibit unwinding
        of the wire drilling line from the spool. Further, operation of the drawworks
        can rotate the spool thereby to extend the wire drilling line into the borehole
        and alternatively to retract the wire drilling line from the borehole. As
        a result, operation of the drawworks thereby can lower the drill string into
        the borehole and alternatively can reel the drill string in from the borehole.
        A system still further can include a mud pump positioned substantially at
        the surface and connected to the drill string. Operation of the mud pump can
        pump a drilling fluid through the one or more segments of drill pipe and the
        bottom hole assembly of the drill string to the drill bit. In addition, a
        system can include a first set of one or more sensors positioned along the
        drill string thereby defining one or more downhole sensors. A system also
        can include a second set of one or more sensors positioned at the surface
        thereby defining one or more surface sensors.<br />[0015] Additionally, a
        system according to an embodiment can include a controller. A controller can
        include one or more processors positioned at the surface and in communication
        with the downhole drive controller, the top drive, the drawworks, the mud
        pump, the one or more downhole sensors, and the one or more surface sensors.
        Further, the controller can be in communication with the downhole drive controller
        and the one or more downhole sensors through the one or more segments of drill
        pipe. A system also can include a non-transitory computer-readable medium
        in communication with the one or more processors of the controller. The non-transitory
        computer-readable medium can have one or more computer programs stored thereon
        that, when executed by the one or more processors, cause the system to perform
        certain actions. For example, a system can determine one or more of a target
        downhole torque on bit (DTOB) measurement value and a target downhole weight
        on bit (DWOB) measurement value responsive to receipt of user input from a
        user computing device in communication with the controller. A system also
        can determine a target toolface orientation measurement value responsive to
        receipt of the user input from the user computing device. In addition, a system
        can determine, responsive to one or more measurements at the one or more downhole
        sensors, an actual toolface orientation measurement value and one or more
        of an actual DTOB measurement value and an actual DWOB measurement value.
        A system further can determine, responsive to one or more measurements at
        the one or more surface sensors, a current top drive operation measurement
        value, a current drawworks operation measurement value, and a current mud
        pump operation value. Additionally, a system can determine one or more error
        values selected from a group of a DTOB error value and a DWOB error value.
        A DTOB error value can be determined responsive to a comparison of the target
        DTOB measurement value to the actual DTOB measurement value, and a DWOB error
        value can be determined responsive to a comparison of the target DWOB measurement
        value to the actual DWOB measurement value. Still further, a system can determine,
        responsive to a comparison of the target toolface orientation measurement
        value and the actual toolface orientation measurement value, a toolface orientation
        error value. A system also can determine a control command for one or more
        of the top drive, the drawworks, and the mud pump to correct each of the toolface
        orientation error value and the one or more of the DTOB error value and the
        DWOB error value responsive to the current top drive operation measurement
        value, the current drawworks operation measurement value, and the current
        mud pump operation value. In addition, a system can operate one or more of
        the top drive, the drawworks, and the mud pump responsive to the control command
        thereby to correct a toolface orientation of the drill string. Operation of
        the drawworks can include altering a weight on bit measurement value at the
        surface. Further, operation of the top drive can include altering one or more
        of an angle of the drill string with respect to the surface and a rotational
        speed of the drill string within the borehole. Operation of the mud pump can
        include altering a flow rate measurement value of the drilling fluid at the
        surface.<br />[0016] In some instances, determining the actual toolface measurement
        value and the one or more of the actual DTOB measurement value and the actual
        DWOB measurement value can include validating the one or more measurements
        at the one or more downhole sensors thereby to produce one or more validated
        measurements, as well as filtering the one or more validated measurements
        thereby to produce one or more filtered measurements. Further, determining
        the actual toolface measurement value and the one or more of the actual DTOB
        measurement value and the actual DWOB measurement value can include reconciling
        the one or more filtered measurements thereby to produce one or more reconciled
        measurements and verifying the one or more reconciled measurements thereby
        to produce one or more verified measurements. Determining the actual toolface
        measurement value and the one or more of the actual DTOB measurement value
        and the actual DWOB measurement value also can include remediating gross errors
        in the one or more verified measurements thereby to produce the actual toolface
        measurement value and the one or more of the actual DTOB measurement value
        and the actual DWOB measurement value. Additionally, in some circumstances,
        the control command can be responsive to one or more dynamic models of the
        drill string within the borehole. Further, operation of the drawworks can
        control a rate of penetration of the drill string. In addition, in some instances,
        the one or more computer programs, when executed by the one or more processors,
        can cause the system to estimate one or more future values of one or more
        downhole variables and to determine an optimal rate of penetration of the
        drill string responsive to a constrained optimization problem. The control
        command can be responsive to the determined optimal rate of penetration of
        the drill string.<br />[0017] Additionally, the control command can be for
        each of the top drive and the drawworks. In some circumstances, determining
        the control command can include using multi-input, multi-output control logic
        to determine the control command. Further, the multi-input, multi-output control
        logic can include a plurality of decision rules, and each of the decision
        rules can be associated with one or more of: drawworks control, top drive
        control, and mud pump control. In other circumstances, determining the control
        command can include using a first single-input, single-output control logic
        to determine the control command for the top drive and a second single-input,
        single-output control logic to determine the control command for the drawworks.<br
        />[0018] Another system according to an embodiment can include a controller,
        which can include one or more processors. Such a system also can include a
        non-transitory computer-readable medium in communication with the one or more
        processors of the controller. The non-transitory computer-readable medium
        can have one or more computer programs stored thereon that, when executed
        by the one or more processors, can cause the system to perform certain actions.
        For example, a system can determine an actual downhole torque on bit (DTOB)
        measurement value and an actual toolface orientation measurement value for
        a drill string positioned in a borehole for a hydrocarbon well. A system also
        can determine, responsive to a comparison of a target DTOB measurement value
        and the actual DTOB measurement value, a DTOB error value. Further, a system
        can determine, responsive to a comparison of a target toolface orientation
        measurement value and the actual toolface orientation measurement value, a
        toolface orientation error value. A system still further can determine a control
        command for one or more of a top drive and a drawworks responsive to the DTOB
        error value and the toolface orientation error value. Additionally, a system
        can operate one or more of the top drive and the drawworks responsive to the
        control command thereby to correct a toolface orientation of the drill string.<br
        />[0019] In some instances, determining the actual DTOB measurement value
        can include determining an actual downhole weight on bit (DWOB) measurement
        value. Additionally, determining the actual DTOB measurement value and the
        actual toolface orientation measurement value can be responsive to one or
        more of: (a) a Kalman filter and (b) one or more measurements at one or more
        sensors positioned within the borehole. Further, the controller can be in
        communication with one or more sensors positioned within the borehole through
        one or more segments of wired drill pipe. The one or more computer programs,
        when executed by the one or more processors, further can cause the system
        to determine a current top drive operation measurement value and a current
        drawworks operation measurement value. Additionally, the control command can
        be responsive to the current top drive operation measurement value and the
        current drawworks operation measurement value. Further, the control command
        can be for one or more of the top drive, the drawworks, and a mud pump, and
        the one or more computer programs, when executed by the one or more processors,
        further can cause the system to determine a current mud pump operation measurement
        value and to operate the mud pump responsive to the control command thereby
        to correct a toolface orientation of the drill string. In some circumstances,
        determining the actual DTOB measurement value and the actual toolface measurement
        value can include validating the one or more measurements at the one or more
        sensors thereby to produce one or more validated measurements and filtering
        the one or more validated measurements thereby to produce one or more filtered
        measurements. Further, determining the actual DTOB measurement value and the
        actual toolface measurement value can include reconciling the one or more
        filtered measurements thereby to produce one or more reconciled measurements
        and verifying the one or more reconciled measurements thereby to produce one
        or more verified measurements. In addition, determining the actual DTOB measurement
        value and the actual toolface measurement value can include remediating gross
        errors in the one or more verified measurements thereby to produce the actual
        DTOB measurement value and the actual toolface measurement value.<br />[0020]
        In addition, operation of the drawworks can include altering a weight on bit
        (WOB) measurement value at a surface of the borehole, and operation of the
        top drive can include altering one or more of an angle of the drill string
        with respect to the surface and a rotational speed of the drill string within
        the borehole. Further, the one or more computer programs, when executed by
        the one or more processors, also can cause the system to determine the target
        DTOB measurement value responsive to receipt of user input from a user computing
        device in communication with the controller. The user input can include one
        or more of: a preselected DTOB measurement value, a preselected rate of penetration,
        a preselected downhole WOB, and a preselected mud motor differential pressure.
        The one or more computer programs, when executed by the one or more processors,
        also can cause the system to determine the target toolface orientation measurement
        value responsive to receipt of the user input from the user computing device.
        Still further, the control command can be responsive to one or more dynamic
        models of the drill string within the borehole, and operation of the drawworks
        can control a rate of penetration of the drill string. The one or more computer
        programs, when executed by the one or more processors, can cause the system
        to estimate one or more future values of one or more downhole variables and
        to determine an optimal rate of penetration of the drill string responsive
        to a constrained optimization problem. Additionally, the control command can
        be responsive to the determined optimal rate of penetration of the drill string.<br

        methods to control directional drilling in borehole drilling for hydrocarbon
        wells. A method according to an embodiment can include, for example, determining
        an actual downhole torque on bit (DTOB) measurement value and an actual toolface
        orientation measurement value for a drill string positioned in a borehole
        for a hydrocarbon well. A method also can include determining, responsive

        actual toolface orientation measurement value, a toolface orientation error
        value. A method additionally can include determining a control command for
        one or more of a top drive and a drawworks responsive to the DTOB error value
        and the toolface orientation error value. Still further, a method can include
        operating one or more of the top drive and the drawworks responsive to the
        control command thereby to correct a toolface orientation of the drill string.<br
        />[0022] In some instances, determining the actual DTOB measurement value

        receiving the one or more measurements from one or more sensors positioned
        within the borehole through one or more segments of wired drill pipe and determining
        a current top drive operation measurement value and a current drawworks operation
        measurement value. The control command also can be responsive to the current
        top drive operation measurement value and the current drawworks operation
        measurement value. Further, the control command can be for one or more of
        the top drive, the drawworks, and a mud pump, and the method also can include
        determining a current mud pump operation measurement value and operating the
        mud pump responsive to the control command thereby to correct a toolface orientation
        of the drill string. In some circumstances, determining the actual DTOB measurement
        value and the actual toolface measurement value can include validating the
        one or more measurements at the one or more sensors thereby to produce one
        or more validated measurements, as well as filtering the one or more validated
        measurements thereby to produce one or more filtered measurements. Determining
        the actual DTOB measurement value and the actual toolface measurement value
        also can include reconciling the one or more filtered measurements thereby
        to produce one or more reconciled measurements and verifying the one or more
        reconciled measurements thereby to produce one or more verified measurements.
        Further, determining the actual DTOB measurement value and the actual toolface
        measurement value can include remediating gross errors in the one or more
        verified measurements thereby to produce the actual DTOB measurement value
        and the actual toolface measurement value.<br />[0023] In addition, operation
        of the drawworks can include altering a weight on bit (WOB) measurement value
        at a surface of the borehole, and operation of the top drive can include altering
        one or more of an angle of the drill string with respect to the surface and
