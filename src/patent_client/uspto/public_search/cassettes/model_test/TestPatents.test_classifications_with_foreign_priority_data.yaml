        />(15)  A main feature of the present invention resides in the use of combination
        of a digital certificate and a secret key to authenticate use of or access
        to a hardware token.<br />(16)  Two exemplary embodiments of the present invention
        will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br />(17) Embodiment
        1<br />(18)  Referring to FIG. 1, a diagram illustrates the overall configuration
        of an exemplary personal authentication system to which the first and second
        embodiments of the present invention may be applied.<br />(19)  Computer 10
        is a client-side PC (personal computer) which makes remote accesses. Connected
        to PC 10 by, for example, a USB connection, is hardware token 30 for performing
        personal authentication with computer 10. Other units connected to computer
        10 via Internet 90 include a certificate authority 50 for registration and
        acquisition of a user certificate and a computer certificate, and a remote
        system 70. Remote system 70 may comprise an intra-company system. Remote system
        70 includes a remote access apparatus 71 connected to Internet 90 and capable
        of accessing, connecting and communicating to/from computer 10, and a remote
        access authentication server 72 which authenticates computer 10 by using a
        user certificate at the time of remote access. Each digital certificate, such
        as a user certificate, contains information such as a serial number, a name
        of the certificate authority 50 that has issued the certificate, an expiration
        date, a name of the owner (user), and a public key for the owner.<br />(20)  Hardware
        token 30, when inserted in an IC card reader/writer, is connected to the computer
        10 via a USB (universal serial bus). A user public key Uk and a user secret
        key Uk'' are stored in hardware token 30. Hardware token 30 may be one of
        IC cards collectively referred to as Smart Cards (trademark), a plastic card,
        a magnetic card, or an optical card. IC cards usable as hardware token 30
        include contact-type cards, such as memory cards and microprocessor cards,
        and noncontact-type cards such as near-contact-type, proximate-type, vicinal-type
        and microware-type cards.<br />(21)  Certificate authority 50 is a third party
        agency which issues digital certificates and assures that a public key is
        authentic. Examples of certificate authorities 50 are Toriton, Inc. and VeriSign
        Japan K. K. Computer 10 makes an application to certificate authority 50 for
        registration of the user public key Uk and obtains a certificate for a user
        public key Uk from certificate authority 50. Computer 10 accesses the remote
        access authentication server 72 by using a user public key Uk stored in hardware
        token 30. At the time of this remote access, remote access authentication
        server 72 authenticates computer 10 by using a user certificate issued by
        the certificate authority 50, thus ensuring certain security.<br />(22)  When
        the user public key Uk stored in hardware token 30 is read out, permission
        to access hardware token 30 from the computer 10 is required. Conventionally,
        a password is used for this permission to access hardware token 30. In this
        embodiment, however, a combination of another digital certificate and a secret
        key other than the conventional password is used foraccess permission.<br
        />(23)  For example, a computer certificate can be used as the &quot;another
        digital certificate&quot; and &quot;secret key combination&quot; referred
        to therein. Presently, in Windows (trademark) systems and the like, a computer
        certificate can be issued for a subject for which a certificate is to be issued,
        as well as for an individual user. When authentication of a Smart Card using
        a computer certificate is performed, only the &quot;rightful&quot; user of
        a computer having a combination of this computer certificate and a secret
        key can access hardware token 30.<br />(24)  In this Embodiment 1, &quot;rightful&quot;,
        as used herein, denotes in a narrow sense a particular computer 10 which may
        be used by a person to which a user certificate is issued.<br />(25)  In Embodiment
        2, described below, &quot;rightful&quot; denotes a computer 10 in which a
        combination of a computer certificate, issued from a particular certificate
        authority 50, and a secret key is held.<br />(26)  However, the methods of
        both embodiments (Embodiment 1 and Embodiment 2), as also the conventional
        authentication based on the password method previously described, are in an
        orthogonal relationship with each other, and only the method of this embodiment
        may be used for authentication, or a combination also using the password method
        may be used for authentication.<br />(27)  Referring to FIG. 2, a block diagram
        shows an exemplary embodiment of a hardware and software configuration of
        computer 10. Computer 10 includes central processing unit (CPU) 11 for controlling
        the operation of the computer, including executing various programs under
        the control of an operating system (OS) 20. Random access memory (RAM) 12
        provides data and program storage for the CPU 11, and interface (I/F) 13 provides
        for communication with hardware token 30. Interface 13 comprises, for example,
        an IC card reader/writer if hardware token 30 is an IC card. Computer 10 also
        has persistent storage 14 including, for example, a read only memory (ROM)
        and an auxiliary read/write (R/W) storage such as a hard disk unit. A computer
        public key, a computer secret key and, if necessary, a certificate authority
        public key, are stored in storage 14.<br />(28)  Operating system 20 may be
        stored in the storage 14, and is loaded to RAM 12 by CPU 11 for execution.
        The operating system 20 thus operated is provided with a hardware token driver
        21 which drives the hardware token 30, a hardware token setting utility 22,
        which includes software for setting hardware token 30, and a public key and
        secret key management/authentication agency utilization utility 23, which
        includes software instructions for managing a public key and a secret key
        and for utilizing the certificate authority 50.<br />(29)  FIG. 3 is a block
        diagram showing an exemplary hardware configuration of hardware token 30.
        Hardware token 30 includes a CPU 31 for overall control, a RAM 32 which is
        a rewritable memory used as a work memory for the CPU 31, and a ROM 33 for
        storing a program executed in hardware token 30. Hardware token 30 also has
        an interface (I/F) 34 communicating with, for example, an IC card reader/writer
        connected to computer 10. Hardware token 30 also has a non-volatile memory
        35, such as an EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable read-only memory),
        a flash memory or an FeRAM (ferro-electric random access memory) for providing
        security-protected storage. A user public key Uk, a user secret key Uk'',
        and a computer public key Ck or a certificate authority public key Ak are
        stored in security-protected storage 35. A passcode used at the time of password
        setting may be also stored in the storage 35 if necessary.<br />(30)  Referring
        to FIGS. 4 and 7, the method of personal authentication of Embodiment 1, using
        the above-described functional configuration, will be described.<br />(31)  In
        the following description, &quot;user certificate Uk&quot; refers to a user
        public key Uk authenticated in the certificate authority 50, &quot;computer
        certificate Ck&quot; to a computer public key Ck authenticated in certificate
        authority 50, and &quot;certificate authority certificate Ak&quot; to a certificate
        authority public key Ak authenticated in certificate authority 50.<br />(32)  FIG.
        4 is a diagram outlining processing with respect to installation of a user
        certificate in accordance with Embodiment 1.<br />(33)  Referring to FIG.
        4, in phase 1, computer 10 first stores a computer public key Ck in hardware
        token 30 and, in phase 3, reads out a user public key Uk stored in the memory
        of the hardware token 30. User public key Uk and a user secret key Uk'' had
        previously, in phase 2, been prepared and stored in hardware token 30.<br
        />(34)  Computer 10 then, in phase 4, makes application to certificate authority
        50 for registration of the user public key Uk and obtains a certificate for
        the user public key Uk from the certificate authority 50. Thereafter, in phase
        5 computer 10 receives and in phase 6 stores user certificate Uk (which is
        the user public key Uk authenticated in the certificate authority 50) in hardware
        token 30. As described above, a computer certificate Ck for computer 10, which
        is usable by the user of hardware token 30, is also installed in hardware
        token 30 either during phase 6, when the user certificate Uk is installed,
        or previously.<br />(35)  FIG. 5 is a diagram for outlining processing with
        respect to use of a user certificate in Embodiment 1.<br />(36)  Referring
        to FIG. 5, in the first phase, random numbers R are generated from the hardware
        token 30 and are sent to computer 10. In phase 2, computer 10 sends back to
        the hardware token 30 a signature Ck''(R) formed on random numbers R with
        a computer secret key Ck''. Hardware token 30 certifies Ck''(R) with Ck and,
        in phase 3, permits computer 10 to make access thereto if Ck''(R) is correct.
        After being permitted to make access, computer 10 can perform operations including,
        in phase 4, readout of the user public key Uk from hardware token 30 and,
        in phase 4'', certification with the user secret key Uk''.<br />(37)  FIG.
        6 is a control flow chart showing processing at the time of user certificate
        installation shown in FIG. 4. Description will be made with reference to the
        block diagrams shown in FIGS. 2 and 3.<br />(38)  Referring to FIG. 6, in
        step 101, CPU 11 executes public key and secret key management/authentication
        agency utilization utility 23 to generate a computer public key Ck and a computer
        secret key Ck''<br />(39)  In step 102, hardware token setting utility 22
        of computer 10 stores the computer public key Ck in security-protected storage
        35 of hardware token 30 through interfaces 13 and 34 of computer 10 and hardware
        token 30, respectively.<br />(40)  In step 103, the CPU 31 of hardware token
        30 generates a user public key Uk and a user secret key Uk'' and stores the
        generated user public key Uk and user secret key Uk'' in the security-protected
        storage 35 of hardware token 30.<br />(41)  In step 104, public key and secret
        key management/authentication agency utilization utility 23 of computer 10
        reads out the user public key Uk from the hardware token 30 through the interfaces
        13 and 34, and in step 105 makes application to certificate authority 50 for
        registration of the user public key Uk.<br />(42)  In step 106, certificate
        authority 50 affixes a signature to user public key Uk, and in step 107 issues
        user certificate for user public key Uk to computer 10. The hardware token
        setting utility 22 of computer 10 stores user certificate Uk (which is the
        user public key Uk after authentication by certificate authority 50) in the
        security-protected storage 35 of hardware token 30 through the interfaces
        13, 34. Processing at the time of user certificate installation is thus completed.<br
        />(43)  Referring to FIG. 7 in connection with FIG. 5, processing at the time
        of use of a user certificate is as follows.<br />(44)  In step 151, the CPU
        31 of hardware token 30 generates random number R, and in step 152 sends random
        number R to computer 10 through the interfaces (I/Fs) 13 and 34.<br />(45)  In
        step 153, computer 10 forms a signature Ck''(R) on the random number R with
        a computer secret key Ck''. In step 154, Ck''(R) is sent to the hardware token
        30 through the I/Fs.<br />(46)  In step 155, the CPU 31 of hardware token
        30 certifies Ck''(R) sent from the computer 10 with the computer public key
        Ck.<br />(47)  In step 156, CPU 31 determines by certification whether or
        not Ck''(R) is correct.<br />(48)  In step 157, if Ck''(R) is not correct,
        CPU 31 performs rejection processing. In step 158, if Ck''(R) is correct,
        CPU 31 informs computer 10 that Ck''(R) is correct (OK).<br />(49)  Thereafter,
        in step 159, in computer 10, user authentication (personal authentication)
        is performed by using the user public key Uk and the user secret key Uk''
        stored in the security-protected storage 35 of the hardware token 30 and various
        kinds of processing are executed. While authentication is performed in the
        remote access authentication server 72, hardware token 30 provides computer
        10 with information (Uk''(R'')) prepared for user authentication on the basis
        of the user public key Uk, the user secret key Uk'' and random numbers R''
        provided from remote access authentication server 72. In computer 10, operations
        including remote access to remote access authentication server 72 shown in
        FIG. 1 are executed by using the information (Uk''(R'')).<br />(50)  According
        to Embodiment 1, as described above, only the computer 10 having the computer
        secret key Ck'' corresponding to the computer public key Ck stored in the
        hardware token 30 can access the hardware token 30. Thus, the level of security
        against unauthorized use of the hardware token 30 can be improved. While the
        description has been made by assuming that only one computer certificate Uk
        is used for ease of explanation, a plurality of computer certificates may
        be used.<br />(51) Embodiment 2<br />(52)  In Embodiment 1, only a particular
        authorized computer 10 can use hardware token 30. In Embodiment 2, this use
        is expanded so all computers 10 authenticated with a public key of certificate
        authority 50 can use hardware token 30. The same functions, as those previously
        described for Embodiment 1 are represented by the same characters, and the
        detailed description of them will not be repeated.<br />(53)  Referring to
        FIG. 8, the process for installing a user certification in accordance with
        Embodiment 2 is set forth.<br />(54)  Prior to the phases represented in FIG.
        8, computer 10 had made application to certificate authority 50 for registration
        of a computer public key Ck and had received back a certificate for the computer
        public key Ck and a pubic key Ak (certificate authority public key Ak) issued
        by certificate authority 50.<br />(55)  In phase 1, computer 10 stores the
        certificate authority public key Ak in hardware token 30. In phase 2, hardware
        token 30 forms a combination of a user public key Uk and a user secret key
        Uk''. In phase 3, computer 10 reads out the user public key Uk from the hardware
        token 30, in phase 4 enrolls the public key Uk by applying to certificate
        authority 50 for registration of that user public key Uk, and in phase 5 obtains
        a certificate for the user public key Uk from certificate authority 50. In
        phase 6, computer 10 stores the certificate for the user public key Uk in
        the hardware token 30.<br />(56)  In this manner, when a certificate for a
        user public key Uk is installed in hardware token 30, or before the certificate
        for a user public key Uk is installed in the hardware token 30, a certificate
        authority public key Ak, authenticated by a certificate authority 50 in which
        a computer public key Ck has previously been authenticated, is installed in
        a computer (or, by the same process, in a plurality of computers) 10 for access
        by a user of hardware token 30.<br />(57)  Referring to FIG. 9, a process
        for using a user certificate in accordance with Embodiment 2, is described.<br
        />(58)  In phase 1, random number R is generated by hardware token 30 and
        sent to computer 10. Computer 10 forms a signature Ck''(R) on the random number
        R with a computer secret key Ck'' and in phase 2 sends Ck''(R) to hardware
        token 30 together with a computer certificate (including computer public key
        Ck).<br />(59)  Hardware token 30 certifies Ck by using the certificate authority
        public key Ak authenticated in the certificate authority 50. If Ck is correct,
        then the hardware token 30 certifies Ck''(R) by using Ck. If Ck''(R) is correct,
        in phase 3, hardware token 30 permits the computer 10 to make access thereto.
        After being permitted to make access, computer 10 can perform operations including,
        in phase 4, readout of the user public key Uk from the hardware token 30 and,
        in phase 4'', certification with the user secret key Uk''.<br />(60)  Referring
        to FIG. 10 in connection with FIGS. 2, 3, and 8, processing at the time of
        user certificate installation will be described.<br />(61)  In step 201, public
        key and secret key management/authentication agency utilization utility 23
        is executed by the CPU 11 of computer 10 to generate a computer public key
        Ck and a computer secret key Ck'', and in step 202 makes application to authentication
        authority, or section, 50 for registration of the computer public key Ck.<br
        />(62)  In step 203, a signature is affixed to the computer public key Ck
        in authentication section 50, and in step 204 a certificate for the computer
        public key Ck is issued from the authentication section 50 to the computer
        10. Also, in step 205, a certificate authority certificate Ak authenticated
        in the certificate authority 50 is issued from the certificate authority 50
        to computer 10.<br />(63)  In step 206, the hardware token setting utility
        22 of computer 10 stores the certificate authority certificate Ak, which has
        been authenticated by certificate authority 50, in the security-protected
        storage 35 of hardware token 30 through the I/Fs (the interface 13 of the
        computer 10 and the interface 34 of the hardware token 30).<br />(64)  In
        step 207, the CPU 31 of hardware token 30 generates a user public key Uk and
        a user secret key Uk'' and stores the generated user public key Uk and user
        secret key Uk'' in the security-protected storage 35 of hardware token 30.<br
        />(65)  In step 208, the public key and secret key management/authentication
        agency utilization utility 23 of computer 10 reads out the user public key
        Uk from hardware token 30 through the I/Fs, and in step 209 makes application
        to the certificate authority 50 for registration of the user public key Uk.<br
        />(66)  In step 210, a signature is affixed to the user public key Uk by certificate
        authority 50, and in step 211, a user certificate Uk for the user public key
        Uk is issued (transmitted) to computer 10.<br />(67)  In step 212, the hardware
        token setting utility 22 of computer 10 stores the user certificate Uk authenticated
        in the certificate authority 50 in the security-protected storage 35 of hardware
        token 30 through the I/Fs. Processing at the time of user certificate installation
        is thus completed.<br />(68)  Referring to FIG. 11 in connection with FIG.
        9, a description will be given of processing at the time of use of a user
        certificate.<br />(69)  In step 251, the CPU 31 of hardware token 30 generates
        random number R, and in step 252 sends the random number R to computer 10
        through the I/Fs (the interface 34 of the hardware token 30 and the interface
        13 of the computer 10).<br />(70)  In step 253, computer 10 forms a signature
        Ck''(R) on the random number R with a computer secret key Ck'', and in step
        254 the generated Ck''(R) is sent to hardware token 30 through the I/Fs. Simultaneously,
        in step 255, the computer public key Ck (computer certificate Ck) authenticated
        in the certificate authority 50 is also sent to hardware token 30.<br />(71)  In
        step 256, the CPU 31 of the hardware token 30 certifies the Ck sent from computer
        10 by using the certificate authority public key Ak stored in security-protected
        storage 35.<br />(72)  In step 257, the hardware token determines by certification
        whether or not Ck is correct. If Ck is not correct, in step 258, rejection
        processing is performed. If Ck is correct, in step 259, the Ck''(R) sent from
        the computer 10 is certified with this Ck.<br />(73)  In step 260, determination
        is made as to whether or not Ck''(R) is correct. If Ck''(R) is not correct,
        in step 261 rejection processing is performed. If Ck''(R) is correct, in step
        262 information indicating that Ck''(R) is correct is sent to the computer
        10. Thereafter, in step 263, user authentication (personal authentication)
        is performed in computer 10 by using the user public key Uk and the user secret
        key Uk'' stored in the security-protected storage 35 of the hardware token
        30 and various additional processing is executed. While authentication is
        performed in the remote access authentication server 72, hardware token 30
        provides computer 10 with information (Uk''(R'')) prepared for user authentication
        on the basis of the user public key Uk and the user secret key Uk''. In computer
        10, operations including remote access to the remote access authentication
        server 72 shown in FIG. 1 are executed by using the information (Uk''(R'')).<br
        />(74)  According to Embodiment 2, as described above, the computer public
        key Ck is recognized as correct when the computer public key Ck is certified
        with the certificate authority public key Ak, and certification is performed
        by using the computer public key Ck, thus enabling a computer 10 having a
        correct computer public key Ck authenticated in the certificate authority
        50 and a computer secret key Ck'' to access hardware token 30.<br />(75)  In
        the above manner, the level of security against unauthorized use of the hardware
        token 30 is improved. Also, the hardware token 30 can be used with a plurality
        of computers 10 authenticated in a particular certificate authority 50, thus
        achieving a large improvement in convenience. While it is assumed that only
        one certificate authority certificate Ak (certificate authority public key
        Ak authenticated in the above-described station 50) exists, a plurality of
        certificate authority public keys Ak may exist with no problem.<br />(76)  While
        this second embodiment has been described with respect to a case where a computer
        public key Ck and a computer secret key Ck'' are generated in computer 10,
        the certificate authority 50 may directly generate keys of these kinds and
        issue certificates for them in some case. Also, while this embodiment has
        been described with respect to a case where a user public key Uk and a user
        secret key Uk'' are generated in the hardware token 30, the certificate authority
        50 may generate keys of these kinds in other cases.<br />(77)  In this second
        embodiment, as described above, not a password but a combination of another
        digital certificate (a public key authenticated in certificate authority 50)
        and a secret key is used as the authentication means for authorizing or permitting
        access to hardware token 30, thereby enabling identification of a computer
        10 permitted to use the hardware token 30. Thus, an authorized use of hardware
        token 30 can be inhibited and the security of the system can be effectively
        improved.<br />(78)  Good use of the present invention can be made, for example,
        in various computers such as notebook PCs and desktop PCs, as also in hardware
        tokens such as IC cards, and network systems using such computers and hardware
        tokens. Also, good use of the present invention can be made, for example,
        as a program executed in such computers.<br />(79) ADVANTAGE OF THE INVENTION<br
        />(80)  It is an advantage of the present invention that a combination of
        a digital certificate and a secret key is used to authenticate access to a
        hardware token to effectively improve the level of security against unauthorized
        access when a hardware token is used.<br />(81) SUMMARY OF SYMBOLS AND COMPUTATIONS<br

        Ak''), where + is a concatenation function, Subject is additional information
        for the certificate, MD is a message digest function such as SHA, and Enc(X,
        Y) is a function to encrypt X using key Y based on a public key encryption
        algorithm such as RSA.<br />(84)  Creation of a signature Ck''(R) formed on
        random numbers R with a computer secret key Ck'', may be calculated as Enc(MD(R),
        Ck''), where MD is a message digest function such as SHA, and Enc is a public
        key encryption algorithm such as RSA.<br />(85)  Creation of a certificate
        authority public key Ak is generated during initial installation of a certificate
        authority. A system administrators generates a key pair including the public
        key Ak and the secret key Ak'', according to a public key encryption algorithm
        such as RSA.<br />(86)  Authenticating a signature Ck''(R) with public key
        Ck involves previously calculating MD(R), where MD is a message digest function,
        and then, to authenticate Ck''(R), calculate Dec(Ck''(R), Ck), where Dec(X,
        Y) is a function to decrypt X using key Y based on a public key encryption
        algorithm. If MD(R) and Dec(Ck''(R), Ck) is the same, it is authenticated.
        If it is not the same, authentication fails.<br />(87)  Forming Uk''(R'')
        on the basis of user secret key Uk'' and random number R'' is done by determining
        Enc(MD(R''), Uk''), where MD is a message digest function, Enc(X, Y) is a
        function to encrypt X using key Y based on a public key encryption algorithm.<br

        Application JP2004-052835, filed 27 Feb. 2004.<br />(3) FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br
        />(4)  The present invention relates to the authentication of a person in
        question and, more particularly, to an authentication method using a hardware
        token such as an Integrated Circuit (IC) card.<br />(5) BACKGROUND ART<br
        />(6)  In recent years, electronic commerce activities in companies for example
        have increased and there have been rapidly increasing tendencies to protect
        personal information in companies.<br />(7)  For example, leakage of personal
        information from a company leads to a considerable loss of social trust in
        the company, including loss of confidence in company management.<br />(8)  On
        the other hand, hiring of temporary employees and outsourcing of operations
        have become prevalent in companies, and the kinds of persons accessing intra-company
        networks for example and the forms of access to such networks have been diversified.
        As a result, even in the case of an intra-company network, it is difficult
        to maintain a computer system in a secure state if only conventional user
        identifiers (IDs) and passwords are used.<br />(9)  A high level of security
        is also required, for example, in settlement systems, various management systems
        in the field of education, public systems related to administrative offices,
        taxation businesses, distribution systems using electronic money for example,
        as well as in intra-company systems. Under these circumstances, techniques
        for individual authentication using hardware tokens typified by IC cards have
        been adopted to cope with menaces such as &quot;eavesdrop&quot;, &quot;falsification&quot;
        and &quot;spoofing&quot;.<br />(10)  FIGS. 12(a) and 12(b) are diagrams for
        explaining a conventional password authentication method using an IC card.
        FIG. 12(a) shows processing at the time of installation of a certificate,
        and FIG. 12(b) shows processing at the time of use of the certificate. In
        the figures are illustrated a computer (PC) 201 which accesses a remote access
        unit (not shown) via a network such as the Internet, and an IC card 202 connected
        to the computer 201 by being inserted in an IC card reader/writer for example.
        A certificate authority 203 connected to the computer 201 via the Internet
        is also illustrated.<br />(11)  Referring to FIG. 12(a), in the conventional
        password authentication method, in phase 1, a password (PIN (personal identity
        number) code) is first set in IC card 202 from computer 201 at the time of
        installation (also referred to as personalization or initialization) of a
        certificate. In phase 2, a public key and a secret key combination is created
        and stored in IC card 202. Thereafter, in phase 3, computer 201 reads out
        the public key from the IC card 202. In phase 4, computer 201 makes application
        to certificate authority 203 for enrollment of the public key. In phase 5,
        certificate authority 203 issues a certificate for this public key to computer
        201. In phase 6, computer 201 stores the public key certificate obtained from
        certificate authority 203 in IC card 202.<br />(12)  Referring to FIG. 12(b),
        use of the certificate is as follows. In phase 1, IC card 202 is connected
        to computer 201 and the password is input through computer 201. In phase 2,
        verification of the password is performed in IC card 202, and in the case
        where the correct password is input, a reply &quot;OK&quot; indicating that
        the password is correct is output from the IC card 202 to the computer 201.
        Password input and verification, or collation, performed in this manner enables
        authentication that a person who has accessed computer 201 by inserting IC
        card 202 in the IC card reader/writer and has entered a password is an authorized
        person. Thereafter, in phase 3, readout of the public key, and in phase 3'',
        authentication with the secret key and so on, are performed between computer
        201 and IC card 202.<br />(13)  Heretofore, a method for implementing individual
        authentication using a certificate stored in an IC card has been proposed
        (see, for example, Yoshio Sato, &quot;Individual Authentication by Smart Card&quot;
        UNISYS TECHNOLOGY REVIEW No. 73, May 2002 (pp 137-139). Sato proposes various
        approaches for realizing authentication of individuals in order to prevent
        unauthorized access. That is, Sato proposes prevention of use of an IC card
        by an unauthorized person, prevention of an unauthorized person from using
        an IC card, prevention of stealing of a secret key, early detection of unauthorized
        use, measures to be taken after detection, measures to be taken when an IC
        card is unusable, and so forth.<br />(14)  In the individual authentication
        method shown in FIGS. 12(a) and 12(b), an IC card 202 is used to store a digital
        certificate for a user public key and a corresponding secret key. The combination
        of the digital certificate and the secret key stored in the IC card 202 is
        used for authenticating a user when a connection is made to a private network
        from a remote base or the like by using a VPN (virtual private network) or
        the like. Conventionally, this is not a method in which a certificate is incorporated
        in a Web browser on computer 201, but rather is a method in which a certificate
        is stored in a hardware token such as IC card 202 which can be carried as
        a &quot;key&quot; (that is, a hardware token) for operating an individual
        authentication device.<br />(15)  However, there exists a risk that a hardware
        token such as IC card 202 may be lost or stolen. To address this risk, conventionally,
        a password is required to access to a hardware token, thus protecting the
        token from being used or accessed by a third person obtaining the hardware
        token.<br />(16)  However, a password is not a sufficiently sturdy protection
        means because it may be stolen, such as through a furtive glance when input
        by a legitimate user, or may be compromised or leaked by the legitimate user
        in a note or otherwise. If a smart card is protected against access only by
        using a password, a security exposure remains. These problems are posed by
        Sato (supra), and solutions proposed, such as &quot;not to leave on a desk&quot;,
        &quot;not to use a PIN using the date or birth or the like&quot;, &quot;to
        enable early detection of unauthorized use by indicating the login date&quot;.
        These solutions fall far short of being adequate for the purpose of preventing
        unauthorized use.<br />(17)  There is, therefore, a need in the art for a
        system and method for improving the security level a hardware token such as
        an IC card used for authentication.<br />(18)  There is, further, a need in
        the art for an improved device for enabling a hardware token to be used only
        in a particular computer.<br />(19)  There is, further, a need in the art
        for enabling a hardware token to be used only in one or more computers certificated
        by a particular certificate authority.<br />(20)  It is, therefore, an object
        of the present invention to provide a hardware token, such as an IC card,
        having a markedly improved level of security against unauthorized access.<br
        />(21) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br />(22)  A system, method, and computer
        program product are provided for authenticating use of or access to a hardware
