        The invention generally relates to processes for the polymerization of olefins.
        More particularly, embodiments disclosed herein relate to multi-stage polymerization
        processes that produce polymers having controlled compositions and molecular
        weight with improved catalyst productivity.<br />[0015] Embodiments of the
        present invention are directed to processes for the polymerization of olefins
        in a reaction sequence that comprises a slurry-phase reactor and a gas-phase
        reactor arranged in series. In accordance with present embodiments, the polymerization
        takes place in the presence of a metallocene catalyst. By controlling the
        polymerization conditions in the slurry-phase and gas-phase reactors, a polyolefin
        having two different molecular weight fractions (also referred to as a multimodal
        polymer) may be produced. For example, the concentration of monomers and hydrogen
        in the slurry-phase reactor and the reactant partial pressures in the gas-phase
        reactor may be controlled to produce a multimodal polyolefin with controlled
        molecular weight and composition. Advantageously, the multimodal polyolefin
        produced in accordance with present embodiments may have improved flowability,
        for example, by production of a lower molecular weight polyolefin in the slurry-phase
        reactor. Improved flowability may be beneficial in the production of films
        due to the resultant high throughput and stable behavior on the film line.
        Improved catalyst productivity may also be obtained by controlling the polymerization
        conditions in the slurry-phase and gas-phase reactors.<br />[0016] It must
        be noted that, as used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular
        forms \u201Ca,\u201D \u201Can\u201D and \u201Cthe\u201D include plural referents
        unless otherwise specified. Thus, for example, reference to \u201Ca leaving
        group\u201D as in a moiety \u201Csubstituted with a leaving group\u201D includes
        more than one leaving group, such that the moiety may be substituted with
        two or more such groups. Similarly, reference to \u201Ca halogen atom\u201D
        as in a moiety \u201Csubstituted with a halogen atom\u201D includes more than
        one halogen atom, such that the moiety may be substituted with two or more
        halogen atoms, reference to \u201Ca substituent\u201D includes one or more
        substituents, reference to \u201Ca ligand\u201D includes one or more ligands,
        and the like.<br />[0017] As used herein, all reference to the Periodic Table
        of the Elements and groups thereof is to the NEW NOTATION published in HAWLEY'S
        CONDENSED CHEMICAL DICTIONARY, Thirteenth Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons,
        Inc., (1997) (reproduced there with permission from IUPAC), unless reference
        is made to the Previous IUPAC form noted with Roman numerals (also appearing
        in the same), or unless otherwise noted.<br />Metallocene Catalysts<br />[0018]
        The catalyst system used in the polymerization process described herein may
        comprise a metallocene catalyst. Suitable metallocene catalysts may be represented
        by Formula (I):<br /><br/><?in-line-formulae description=\\\"In-line Formulae\\\"
        end=\\\"lead\\\"?>Cp.sup.ACp.sup.BMX.sub.n\u2003\u2003(I)<?in-line-formulae
        description=\\\"In-line Formulae\\\" end=\\\"tail\\\"?><br />wherein M is
        a transition metal; each X is chemically bonded to M; each Cp group is chemically
        bonded to M; and n is 0 or an integer from 1 to 4. In some embodiments, n

        describe the use of lithium (2,2\u2032-bisphenyl-ditrimethylsilicate).4THF
        as an activator for a metallocene catalyst compound. WO 99/18135 describes
        the use of organo-boron-aluminum activators. EP-B1-0 781 299 describes using
        a silylium salt in combination with a non-coordinating compatible anion. WO
        2007/024773 suggests the use of activator-supports which may comprise a chemically-treated
        solid oxide, clay mineral, silicate mineral, or any combination thereof. Also,
        methods of activation such as using radiation (see e.g., EP-B1-0 615 981),
        electro-chemical oxidation, and the like are also contemplated as activating
        methods for the purposes of rendering the neutral metallocene catalyst compound
        or precursor to a metallocene cation capable of polymerizing olefins. Other
        activators or methods for activating a metallocene catalyst compound are described

        WO 98/32775.<br />Methods for Supporting<br />[0039] The above described metallocene
        catalysts may be combined with one or more supports using one of the support
        methods well known in the art or as described below. In one particular embodiment,
        a metallocene catalyst is used in a supported form. For example, the metallocene
        catalyst may be used in a supported form wherein the metallocene catalyst
        is deposited on, contacted with, or incorporated within, adsorbed or absorbed
        in, or on a support or carrier.<br />[0040] As used herein, the term \u201Csupport\u201D
        and \u201Ccarrier\u201D are used interchangeably and refer to any porous or
        non-porous support material, including porous support materials such as talc,
        inorganic oxides and inorganic chlorides. Other carriers include resinous
        support materials such as polystyrene divinyl benzene polyolefins or polymeric
        compounds, or any other organic or inorganic support material and the like,
        or mixtures thereof<br />[0041] Examples of suitable supports are inorganic
        oxides that include those Group 2, 3, 4, 5, 13 or 14 metal oxides. Specific
        examples of suitable supports include silica, alumina, silica-alumina, magnesium
        chloride, and mixtures thereof. Other useful supports include magnesia, titania,
        zirconia, montmorillonite (EP-B1 0 511 665) and the like. Also, combinations
        of these support materials may be used, for example, silica-chromium, silica-alumina,
        silica-titania and the like.<br />[0042] In some embodiments, the support,
        such as an inorganic oxide, has a surface area in the range of from about
        10 to about 700 m.sup.2/g, pore volume in the range of from about 0.1 to about
        4.0 cc/g and average particle size in the range of from about 5 to about 500
        \u03BCm. In additional embodiments, the surface area of the support is in
        the range of from about 50 to about 500 m.sup.2/g, pore volume of from about
        0.5 to about 3.5 cc/g and average particle size of from about 10 to about
        200 \u03BCm. In yet additional embodiments, the surface area of the support
        is from about 100 to about 400 m.sup.2/g, pore volume from about 0.8 to about
        3.0 cc/g and average particle size is from about 5 to about 100 \u03BCm. The
        average pore size of the support may be in the range of from 10 to 1000 A,
        50 to about 500 A, or 75 to about 350 A.<br />[0043] Examples of supported
        metallocene catalyst systems are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,701,432, 4,808,561,

        and WO 95/32995, WO 95/14044, WO 96/06187 and WO 97/02297.<br />[0044] In
        one embodiment, the metallocene catalyst may be deposited on the same or separate
        supports together with an activator, or the activator may be used in an unsupported
        form, or may be deposited on a support different from the supported metallocene
        catalyst, or any combination thereof<br />[0045] There are various other methods
        in the art for supporting a polymerization catalyst compound or catalyst system
        of the invention. For example, the metallocene catalyst may contain a polymer
        bound ligand as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,473,202 and 5,770,755, the metallocene
        catalyst may be spray dried as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,648,310, the support
        used with the metallocene catalyst may be functionalized as described in EP-A-0
        802 203, or at least one substituent or leaving group is selected as described
        in U.S. Pat. No. 5,688,880.<br />[0046] In some embodiments, a supported metallocene
        catalyst system may be used that includes an antistatic agent or surface modifier
        that is used in the preparation of the supported catalyst system as described
        in WO 96/11960. The catalyst systems may be prepared in the presence of an
        olefin, for example hexene-1.<br />[0047] In some embodiments, a method for
        producing the supported metallocene catalyst system is described in WO 96/00245
        and WO 96/00243. In this method, the metallocene catalyst is slurried in a
        liquid to form a metallocene solution and a separate solution is formed containing
        an activator and a liquid. The liquid may be any compatible solvent or other
        liquid capable of forming a solution or the like with the cyclic bridged metallocene
        catalyst compounds and/or activator of the invention. In one particular embodiment,
        the liquid is a cyclic aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon, such as toluene.
        The metallocene catalyst and activator solutions are mixed together and added
        to a porous support or the porous support is added to the solutions such that
        the total volume of the metallocene catalyst solution and the activator solution
        or the metallocene catalyst and activator solution is less than four times
        the pore volume of the porous support, more preferably less than three times,
        even more preferably less than two times; preferred ranges being from 1.1
        times to 3.5 times range and most preferably in the 1.2 to 3 times range.
        Another preferred method is to pre-react the porous support with an activator
        in a hydrocarbon diluent. The hydrocarbon solution of the metallocene catalyst
        is added later to complete the catalyst preparation.<br />[0048] Procedures
        for measuring the total pore volume of a porous support are well known in
        the art. Details of one of these procedures are discussed in Volume 1, Experimental
        Methods in Catalytic Research (Academic Press, 1968) (specifically see pages
        67-96). This preferred procedure involves the use of a classical BET apparatus
        for nitrogen absorption. Another method well known in the art is described
        in Innes, Total Porosity and Particle Density of Fluid Catalysts By Liquid
        Titration, Vol. 28, No. 3, Analytical Chemistry 332-334 (March, 1956).<br
        />[0049] The mole ratio of the metal of the activator component to the metal
        of the supported cyclic bridged metallocene catalyst compounds may be in the
        range of between 0.3:1 to 1000:1, preferably 20:1 to 800:1, and most preferably
        50:1 to 500:1. Where the activator is an ionizing activator such as those
        based on the anion tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)boron, the mole ratio of the
        metal of the activator component to the metal component of the cyclic bridged
        metallocene catalyst may be in the range of between 0.3:1 to 3:1. Where an
        unsupported cyclic bridged metallocene catalyst is utilized, the mole ratio
        of the metal of the activator component to the metal of the cyclic bridged
        metallocene catalyst may be in the range of between 0.3:1 to 10,000:1, 100:1
        to 5000:1, or 500:1 to 2000:1.<br />[0050] In one particular embodiment, the
        catalyst system comprises a metallocene catalyst as described herein activated
        by methylaluminoxane (MAO) and supported by silica. While conventionally,
        MAO is combined with a metallocene catalyst and then the combination is deposited
        on silica, in some embodiments, the activator (e.g. MAO) and the support (e.g.
        silica) may be first combined and then combined with the metallocene catalyst.
        Modified MAO (MMAO) or a combination of MAO and MMAO may also be used. In
        one embodiment, the catalyst compound comprises Me.sub.2Si(H.sub.4Ind)ZrCl.sub.2,
        where Me is methyl and H.sub.4Ind is tetrahydroindenyl.<br />[0051] In another
        particular embodiment, the catalyst system comprises a metallocene catalyst
        as described herein activated by methylaluminoxane (MAO) and supported by
        silica. While conventionally, MAO is combined with a metallocene catalyst
        and then the combination is deposited on silica, in some embodiments, the
        activator (e.g. MAO) and the support (e.g. silica) may be first combined and
        then combined with the metallocene catalyst. Modified MAO (MMAO) or a combination
        of MAO and MMAO may also be used. In one embodiment, the catalyst compound
        comprises (C.sub.5H.sub.3Me n-Bu).sub.2ZrCl.sub.2, where Me is methyl n-Bu
        is n-butyl.<br />[0052] In one embodiment the metallocene catalyst is used
        in an unsupported form, preferably in a liquid form such as described in U.S.
        Pat. Nos. 5,317,036 and 5,693,727, and EP-A-0 593 083. The metallocene catalyst
        in liquid form can be fed to a reactor as described in WO 97/46599.<br />[0053]
        In one embodiment, the metallocene catalyst may be combined with a carboxylic
        acid salt of a metal ester, for example aluminum carboxylates such as aluminum
        mono, di- and tri-stearates, aluminum octoates, oleates and cyclohexylbutyrates,
        as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,300,436 and 7,354,880.<br />Multi-Stage Polymerization
        Process<br />[0054] Embodiments for producing polyolefins disclosed herein
        may utilize a multi-stage polymerization process. The polymerization process
        may be carried out, for example, in a series of polymerization stages selected
        from the group of slurry-phase and gas-phase polymerization stages. In some
        embodiments, the polymerization process may comprise a slurry-phase reactor
        and a gas-phase reactor arranged in series. Embodiments of the process may
        comprise more than one slurry-phase reactor and more than one gas-phase reactor,
        for example, up to 10 slurry-phase reactors and 5 gas-phase reactors may be
        used. Example multi-stage polymerization processes are described in more detail
        in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,552,150 and 7,576,166 and U.S. Patent Publication No.
        2011/028827.<br />[0055] The processes described herein are suitable for the
        production of homopolymers of olefins, including ethylene and/or propylene,
        and/or copolymers, terpolymers, and the like, of olefins, including polymers
        comprising ethylene and/or propylene and at least one or more other olefins
        (also referred to as a co-monomer). In an embodiment, the olefin is a monomer
        selected from the group consisting of ethylene, propylene, and any combination
        thereof. In some embodiments, the ethylene content of the polyethylene prepared
        by the processes disclosed herein may be at least about 50% by weight of the
        total monomers involved. The term \u201Cpolyethylene\u201D when used herein
        is used generically to refer to any or all of the polymers comprising ethylene.<br
        />[0056] One or more co-monomers may be employed at any stage of the polymerization
        process. The co-monomers may be alpha-olefins. The co-monomers, for example,
        may contain from 2 to 16 carbon atoms in one embodiment. In other embodiments,
        ethylene and a co-monomer comprising from 3 to 12 carbon atoms, or from 4
        to 10 carbon atoms, or from 4 to 8 carbon atoms, may be used. Specific examples
        of co-monomers that may be used herein include ethylene, propylene, 1-butene,
        1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene, 1-octene, 4-methylpent-1-ene, 1-decene, 1-dodecene,
        1-hexadecene and the like. Also usable are polyenes such as 1,3-hexadiene,
        1,4-hexadiene, cyclopentadiene, dicyclopentadiene, 4-vinylcyclohex-1-ene,
        1,5-cyclooctadiene, 5-vinylidene-2-norbornene and 5-vinyl-2-norbornene, and
        olefins formed in situ in the polymerization medium. When olefins are formed
        in situ in the polymerization medium, the formation of polyolefins containing
        long chain branching may occur. The content of the co-monomer (e.g., the alpha-olefin)
        incorporated into the copolymer may be no greater than 30 mole percent (\u201Cmol
        %\u201D) in total, or may be from 3 to 20 mol %.<br />[0057] Hydrogen may
        also be used at any stage of the polymerization process. Hydrogen is often
        used in olefin polymerization to control the final properties of the polyolefin.
        Increasing the concentration (partial pressure) of hydrogen may increase the
        melt flow rate (MFR) and/or melt index (MI) of the polyolefin generated. The
        MFR or MI can thus be influenced by the hydrogen concentration. The amount
        of hydrogen in the polymerization may be expressed as a mole ratio relative
        to the total polymerizable monomer, for example, ethylene, or a blend of ethylene
        and hexene or propylene. In an embodiment, the amount of hydrogen used in
        the polymerization processes is an amount sufficient to achieve the desired
        MFR or MI of the final polyolefin resin. Melt flow rate for polypropylene
        may be measured according to ASTM D 1238 (230\xB0 C. with 2.16 kg weight);
        melt index (I.sub.2) for polyethylene may be measured according to ASTM D
        1238 (190\xB0 C. with 2.16 kg weight).<br />[0058] As previously mentioned,
        the multi-stage reaction may comprise two or more polymerization stages arranged
        in series. By way of example, a first slurry-phase reaction stage may be carried
        out in one or more slurry-phase reactors, and a second gas-phase reaction
        stage may be carried out in one or more gas-phase reactors. In the first reaction
        stage, an olefin, optionally hydrogen, and/or an optional co-monomer may be
        subjected to a first polymerization reaction to produce a first polyolefin
        fraction. A reactor effluent comprising the first polymerization fraction
        may be recovered from the slurry-phase reaction stage and fed to the gas-phase
        reaction stage with additional olefin, optional hydrogen, and optional co-monomer
        also being fed to the gas-phase stage. The additional olefin, optional hydrogen,
        and optional co-monomer may then be subjected to a second polymerization reaction
        in the presence of the first polymerization fraction to produce a second polyolefin
        fraction. A reactor effluent comprising the first and second polymerization
        fractions may be recovered from the gas-phase polymerization stage.<br />[0059]
        The slurry-phase polymerization stage may include any known reactor suitable
        for use in slurry-phase polymerization. This type of reactor, and means for
        operating the reactor are well known. Examples of suitable reactors include
        continuous stirred tank reactors and loop reactors. In loop reactors, the
        slurry may be circulated with a high velocity along a closed pipe by using
        a circulation pump. More than one slurry-phase reactor may be used in series.
        For example, the polymer suspension produced in the polymerization reaction
        in an inert hydrocarbon may be fed without separation of inert components
        and monomers to the following slurry-phase reactor, either periodically or
        continuously. The following slurry-phase reactor may act at a lower temperature
        and pressure than the previous slurry-phase reactor.<br />[0060] In some embodiments,
        a slurry comprising an olefin and a diluent, such as a hydrocarbon diluent,
        may be fed to the slurry-phase reaction stage. Optionally, the slurry may
        further comprise the hydrogen and co-monomer. Examples of suitable hydrocarbon
        diluents include C.sub.3 to C.sub.8 hydrocarbons such as propane, propylene,
        n-butane, isobutane, hexanes such as n-hexane and isohexanes, heptanes, octanes,
        and mixtures thereof. In some embodiments, the diluent may be a low boiling
        point hydrocarbon having form 1 to 4 carbon atoms or a mixture of such hydrocarbons.
        In particular embodiments, the diluent may comprise propane with minor amounts
        of methane, ethane, and/or butane.<br />[0061] The concentration of the olefin,
        hydrogen, and/or co-monomer in the slurry may be adjusted to control properties
        of the polymer product, such as the molecular weight and composition. Higher
        concentrations of hydrogen produce homopolymers or copolymers of lower molecular
        weight and therefore higher MFR or MI. For co-polymerization, the density
        of the polymer product is related to the concentration of co-monomer with
        the polymer density decreasing with increasing co-monomer concentration. The
        olefin may be present in the slurry in an amount from about 2 mol % to about
        50 mol %, about 3 mol % to about 20 mol %, or about 3 mol % to about 10 mol
        %. For producing propylene homopolymer, the polymerization may be run in liquid
        propylene with hydrogen for molecular weight control. Higher olefin content
        may increase catalyst productivity, but can require more ethylene recycle
        than if a lower concentration was used. Where used, the mole ratio of co-monomer
        to olefin is in the range of about 0.01 to 1.0, or about 0.05 to 0.6 and is
        determined by the density of polymer to be made and the incorporation efficiency
        of the catalyst. Where used, the hydrogen may be present in the slurry in
        ratio to ethylene expressed in molar parts per million of hydrogen to olefin
        in mole percent in the range of about 1.0 to 25 or from about 1.5 to 15 or
        from about 2 to 10. For the slurry reactor, control of the polymer density
        may be primarily controlled by the ratio of co-monomer to monomer and the
        MI by the ratio of hydrogen to monomer. Embodiments may use higher reactor
        temperatures to achieve higher MI and higher density at the same concentrations
        of monomer, co-monomer and hydrogen. Control of reactor temperature and monomer,
        co-monomer and hydrogen may be used to produce the desired copolymer properties.<br
        />[0062] In one embodiment, the one or more reactors in the slurry-phase polymerization
        stage may have a temperature ranging from about 50\xB0 C. to about 115\xB0
        C., from about 60\xB0 C. to about 110\xB0 C., or from about 70\xB0 C. to about
        100\xB0 C. In one embodiment, the one or more reactors in the slurry-phase
        polymerization stage may have a pressure ranging from 1 bar to 150 bar or
        from 1 bar to 100 bar or from about 5 bar to 70 bar.<br />[0063] A reactor
        effluent comprising the first polyolefin fraction produced in the slurry-phase
        polymerization stage may be withdrawn and transferred to a gas-phase polymerization
        stage, which may comprise one or more gas-phase polymerization reactors. The
        first polyolefin fraction may be withdrawn from the slurry-phase polymerization
        stage, either intermittently or continuously. In some embodiments, the pressure
        of the first polymerization product and the slurry including the diluent and
        optional hydrogen may be reduced after the slurry-phase polymerization stage
        to evaporate volatile components such as the residual hydrogen and diluent
        from the reactor effluent. The residual hydrogen and diluent may be recycled
        for reuse in the slurry-phase polymerization stage.<br />[0064] In general,
        the gas-phase polymerization stage may be a continuous gas-phase process,
        such as a fluid-bed process. In an embodiment, a fluid-bed reactor may have
        a reaction zone and a velocity reduction zone (i.e., disengagement zone).
        The reaction zone includes a bed of growing polymer particles, formed polymer
        particles and a minor amount of catalyst particles fluidized by the continuous
        flow of the gaseous monomer and diluent to remove heat of polymerization through
        the reaction zone. Optionally, some or all of the recirculated gases may be
        cooled and compressed to form liquids in the circulating gas that increase
        the heat removal capacity of the circulating gas stream when readmitted to
        the reaction zone. A suitable rate of gas flow may be readily determined by
        simple experiment. Makeup of gaseous monomer may be added to the circulating
        gas stream at a rate equal to the rate at which particulate polymer product
        and monomer associated therewith is withdrawn from the reactor, and the composition
        of the gas passing through the reactor is adjusted to maintain an essentially
        steady state gaseous composition within the reaction zone. The second polyolefin
        fraction produced in the gas-phase reactor and the first polyolefin fraction
        may be withdrawn from the reaction zone, either intermittently or continuously.
        The gas leaving the reaction zone is passed to the velocity reduction zone
        where entrained particles are removed. Finer entrained particles and dust
        may be removed in a cyclone and/or fine filter. The gas is passed through
        a heat exchanger wherein the heat of polymerization is removed, compressed
        in a compressor and then returned to the reaction zone.<br />[0065] Useful
        gas phase polymerization processes include those that utilize a fluidized
        bed reactor. This type reactor, and means for operating the reactor, are well
        known and are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,709,853; 4,003,712;
        4,011,382; 4,302,566; 4,543,399; 4,882,400; 5,352,749; 5,541,270; EP-A-0 802
        202. These patents disclose gas phase polymerization processes wherein the
        polymerization medium is either mechanically agitated or fluidized by the
        continuous flow of the gaseous monomer and diluent.<br />[0066] In one embodiment,
        the one or more reactors in the gas phase or fluidized bed polymerization
        stage may have a pressure ranging from about 0.7 to about 70 bar or from about
        5 bar to about 50 bar or from about 10 bar to 30 bar. In one embodiment, the
        one or more reactors may have a temperature ranging from about 10\xB0 C. to
        about 150\xB0 C., or from about 50\xB0 C. to about 115\xB0 C. In an embodiment,
        the reactor temperature may be operated at the highest feasible temperature
        taking into account the sintering temperature of the polymer within the reactor.
        In embodiments, the superficial gas velocity in the one or more reactors may
        range from about 0.2 to about 1.1 meters/second (about 0.7 to about 3.5 feet/second),
        or from about 0.3 to about 0.9 meters/second (about 1.0 to about 2.7 feet/second)
        or from about 0.5 to 0.8 meters/second (about 1.6 to about 2.6 feet/second).
        In embodiments, stirred or fluidized bed gas phase polymerization systems
        may be used.<br />[0067] The concentration of the olefin, hydrogen, and/or
        co-monomer in the gas-phase in the gas-phase reactor may be adjusted to control
        properties of the polymer product, such as the molecular weight by adjusting
        the hydrogen to olefin ratio and composition by adjusting the co-monomer to
        olefin ratio. By maintaining the olefin concentration and ratios of co-monomer
        to olefin and hydrogen to olefin constant as well as maintaining a constant
        reactor temperature are required to produce a polymer or copolymer with consistent
        and uniform properties. The olefin may be present in the gas phase in an amount
        from about 5 mole % to about 80 mole %, about 10 mole % to about 70 mole %
        by mole, or about 30% mole % to about 70 mole %. Where used, the co-monomer
        may be present in the gas phase in an amount in mole ratio to the olefin from
        about 0.005 to about 0.25 or from about 0.03 to about 0.08 mole co-monomer
        to mole olefin. Where used, the hydrogen may be present in the gas phase in
        an amount in ratio to the olefin in molar parts per million to olefin mole
        percent (ppm/mol %) of from about 1.0 to about 16.0 or from about 1.5 to about
        10.0.<br />[0068] The partial pressures of the olefin, hydrogen, and/or co-monomer
        in the gas-phase in the gas-phase reactor may be adjusted to control properties
        of the polymer product, such as the molecular weight and composition. Olefin
        partial pressure in a gas phase reactor are generally in the range of from
        about 5 bar to about 50 bar or from about 6 bar to about 25 bar or from about
        8 to about 20 bar. Where used, the co-monomer may be present in the gas phase
        in an amount in mole ratio to the olefin from about 0.005 to about 0.40 or
        from about 0.01 to about 0.25 mole co-monomer to mole olefin. Where used,
        the hydrogen may be present in the gas phase in an amount in ratio to the
        olefin in molar parts per million to olefin mole percent (ppm/mol %) of from
        about 1.0 to about 30.0 or from about 1.5 to about 20.0. In embodiments, one
        or more olefins, including ethylene or propylene or combinations thereof,
        may be prepolymerized in the presence of a metallocene catalyst system prior
        to the main polymerization. The prepolymerization may be carried out batch-wise
        or continuously in gas, solution or slurry phase, including at elevated pressures.
        The prepolymerization may take place with any olefin monomer or combination
        and/or in the presence of any molecular weight controlling agent such as hydrogen.
        Co-monomers may also be used in the prepolymerization. For examples of prepolymerization
        procedures, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,748,221; 4,789,359; 4,923,833; 4,921,825;
        5,283,278; and 5,705,578 and European publication EP-B-0279 863 and WO 97/44371.
        In embodiments, the metallocene catalyst system may all be fed into the prepolymerization
        stage. However, portions of the metallocenes catalyst system and cocatalyst,
        if any, may also be fed into the other polymerization stages, as desired for
        a particular application.<br />[0069] Processes disclosed herein may optionally
        use inert particulate materials as fluidization aids in the gas phase polymerization
        reactor. These inert particulate materials can include carbon black, silica,
        talc, and clays, as well as inert polymeric materials. Carbon black, for example,
        has a primary particle size of about 10 nanometers to about 100 nanometers,
        an average size of aggregate of about 0.1 microns to about 30 microns, and
        a specific surface area from about 30 m.sup.2/g to about 1500 m.sup.2/g. Silica
        has a primary particle size of about 5 nanometers to about 50 nanometers,
        an average size of aggregate of about 0.1 microns to about 30 microns, and
        a specific surface area from about 50 m.sup.2/g to about 500 m.sup.2/g. Clay,
        talc, and polymeric materials have an average particle size of about 0.01
        microns to about 10 microns and a specific surface area of about 3 m.sup.2/g
        to 30 m.sup.2/g. These inert particulate materials may be used in amounts
        ranging from about 0.3% to about 80%, or from about 5% to about 50%, based
        on the weight of the final product. They are especially useful for the polymerization
        of sticky polymers as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,994,534 and 5,304,588.<br
        />[0070] Chain transfer agents, promoters, scavenging agents and other additives
        may be, and often are, used in the multi-stage polymerization processes disclosed
        herein. Chain transfer agents are often used to control polymer molecular
        weight. Examples of these compounds are hydrogen and metal alkyls of the general
        formula M.sup.xR.sub.y, where M is a Group 3-12 metal, x is the oxidation
        state of the metal, typically 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, each R is independently
        an alkyl or aryl, and y is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. In some embodiments, a
        zinc alkyl is used, such as diethyl zinc. Typical promoters may include halogenated
        hydrocarbons such as CHCl.sub.3, CFCl.sub.3, CH.sub.3\u2014CCl.sub.3, CF.sub.2Cl\u2014CCl.sub.3,
        and ethyltrichloroacetate. Such promoters are described in, for example, U.S.
        Pat. No. 4,988,783. Other organometallic compounds such as scavenging agents
        for poisons may also be used to increase catalyst activity. Examples of these
        compounds include metal alkyls, such as aluminum alkyls, for example, triisobutylaluminum.
        Some compounds may be used to neutralize static in the fluidized-bed reactor,
        others known as drivers rather than antistatic agents, may consistently force
        the static from positive to negative or from negative to positive. The use
        of these additives is well within the skill of those skilled in the art. These
        additives may be added to the circulation loops, riser, and/or downer separately
        or independently from the catalyst, or as part of the catalyst<br />[0071]
        In embodiments, the reactors disclosed herein are capable of producing greater
        than 500 lbs of polymer per hour (227 kg/hr) to about 300,000 lbs/hr (136,000
        kg/hr) or higher of polymer, preferably greater than 1000 lbs/hr (455 kg/hr),
        more preferably greater than 10,000 lbs/hr (4540 kg/hr), even more preferably
        greater than 25,000 lbs/hr (11,300 kg/hr), still more preferably greater than
        35,000 lbs/hr (15,900 kg/hr), still even more preferably greater than 50,000
        lbs/hr (22,700 kg/hr) and most preferably greater than 65,000 lbs/hr (29,000
        kg/hr) to greater than 175,000 lbs/hr (79,450 kg/hr).<br />Polymerization
        Products<br />[0072] Embodiments of the multi-stage polymerization processes
        may be used to produce a polyolefin. As previously described, the polymer
        products may be homopolymers of olefins, including ethylene and/or propylene,
        and/or copolymers, terpolymers, and the like, of olefins, including polymers
        comprising ethylene and/or propylene and at least one or more other olefins
        (also referred to as a co-monomer). By controlling the reaction conditions,
        a multi-modal polyolefin may be produced. Accordingly, the polyolefins produced
        in the multi-stage polymerization processes may comprise a first polyolefin
        fraction and a second polyolefin fraction.<br />[0073] The first polyolefin
        fraction produced in the slurry-phase polymerization stage may have, for example,
        a density of less than about 940 kg/m.sup.3 or less than about 930 kg/m.sup.3.
        In some embodiments, the first polyolefin fraction may have a density ranging
        from about 920 kg/m.sup.3 to about 940 kg/m.sup.3 or from about 925 kg/m.sup.3
        to about 935 kg/m.sup.3. The first polyolefin fraction produced in the slurry-phase
        polymerization stage may have, for example, a melt index (MI) or (I2) as measured
        by ASTM-D-1238-E (190\xB0 C./2.16 kg) of 1 dg/min or greater or of 5 dg/min
        or greater.<br />[0074] The second polyolefin fraction produced in the gas-phase
        polymerization stage may have, for example, a density of less than about 930
        kg/m.sup.3 or less than about 925 kg/m.sup.3. In some embodiments, the second
        polyolefin fraction may have a density ranging from about 905 kg/m.sup.3 to
        about 930 kg/m.sup.3 or from about 915 kg/m.sup.3 to about 925 kg/m.sup.3.
        The second polyolefin fraction produced in the gas-phase polymerization may
        have, for example, a melt index of 3 dg/min or less or of 1 dg/min or less.<br
        />[0075] The polyolefins produced in the multi-stage polymerization process
        may contain, for example, from about 20% to about 50% of the first polyolefin
        fraction and from about 80% to about 50% of the second polyolefin fraction.
        In other embodiments, the polyolefins may contain, for example, from about
        35% to about 45% of the first polyolefin fraction and from about 65% to about
        55% of the second polyolefin fraction or from about 37% to about 43% of the
        first polyolefin fraction and from about 63% to about 57% of the second polyolefin
        fraction.<br />[0076] The polyolefins produced in the multi-stage polymerization
        process may have a density, for example, ranging from about 915 kg/m.sup.3
        to about 925 kg/m.sup.3. In some embodiments, the polyolefins may have a density,
        for example, ranging from about 918 kg/m.sup.3 to about 922 kg/m.sup.3. Melt
        Index Ratio (MIR, I.sub.21/I.sub.2) of the resultant polyolefins may be controlled
        in the range of from about 17 to about 25 or from about 17 to about 22 or
        from about 18 to about 21<br />[0077] The polyolefins produced by the multi-stage
        polymerization process may have a molecular weight distribution, a weight
        average molecular weight to number average molecular weight (Mw/Mn), for example,
        of greater than 1.5 to about 15. In other embodiments, the polymers may have
        an Mw/Mn of greater than 2 to about 10 or greater than about 2.2 to less than
        about 4.<br />[0078] The polyolefins produced by the multi-stage polymerization
        process may have a melt index (MI) or (I2), for example, in the range from
        0.01 dg/min to 10 dg/min. In other embodiments, the polymers may have a melt
        index of from about 0.1 dg/min to about 5 dg/min or from about 0.5 dg/min
        to about 3 dg/min. For example, the polymer may have a melt index of about
        3 dg/min or less or of about 1 dg/min or less.<br />[0079] The polymers of
        the invention in an embodiment may have a melt index ratio (I.sub.21/I.sub.2)
        (121 is measured by ASTM-D-1238-F, [190\xB0 C./21.6 kg]), for example, of
        from 15 to 30. In other embodiments, the polymers may have an melt index ratio
        of from 17 to less than 25, from 18 to 22.<br />[0080] The polymers produced
        by embodiments of the process of the invention can be used in a wide variety
        of products and end-use applications. The polymers produced by the process
        of the invention may include, but are not limited to, linear low density polyethylene.<br
        />[0081] In some embodiments, the polymer produced by embodiments of the present
        invention may be used to produce a polymer product characterized by a low
        gel count. By way of example, the polymer products comprising the polyolefins
        may have a gel count of about 300 gels per square meter or less in one embodiment.
        The gel count of the polymer products may be determined using an OCS gel counter
        as will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br />[0082] Polymers
        produced by the process of the invention and blends thereof are useful in
        such forming operations as film, pipe, sheet, fiber extrusion and co-extrusion.
        Films include blown or cast films formed by coextrusion or by lamination useful
        as shrink film, cling film, stretch film, sealing films, oriented films, snack
        packaging, heavy duty bags, grocery sacks, baked and frozen food packaging,
        medical packaging, industrial liners, membranes, etc. in food-contact and
        non-food contact applications. Fibers may include, are not limited to, melt
        spinning, solution spinning and melt blown fiber operations for use in woven
        or non-woven form to make filters, diaper fabrics, medical garments, geotextiles,
        etc. Extruded articles may include medical tubing, wire and cable coatings,
        geomembranes, and pond liners.<br />EXAMPLES<br />[0083] The following examples
        are put forth so as to provide those skilled in the art with a complete disclosure
        and description of how to make and use the methods and systems of the invention,
        and are not intended to limit the scope of that which the inventors regard
        as their invention.<br />[0084] In all the Examples, Catalysts A and B were
        used. Catalyst A is XCAT\u2122 HP-100 catalyst, available from Univation Technologies,
        Houston, Tex. XCAT\u2122 HP-100 catalyst is a single-site metallocene catalyst.
        Catalyst B is single site transition metal coordination catalyst. Catalyst
        B is a comparative catalyst that was used in evaluation of the performance
        of Catalyst A in the following Examples.<br />Example 1<br />[0085] Ethylene
        was polymerized in a bench-scale slurry-phase reactor using either Catalyst
        A or Catalyst B (comparative). A series of runs was conducted using either
        Catalyst A or Catalyst B. For each run, the slurry comprised ethylene and
        a co-monomer in a propane diluent (1350 ml). The co-monomer included in the
        slurry was 1-hexene (37 ml). The ethylene concentration in the loop reactor
        was 12 mol %. The reactor was operated at 80\xB0 C. and 38 bar pressure. The
        polymerizations were each conducted for 60 minutes. In contrast to Catalyst
        B, Catalyst A was observed to have process stability in that there was no
        activity decay during the 60 minute polymerization.<br />[0086] <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG.
        1</figref> is a graph showing MFR (190\xB0 C./2.16 kg) of the resultant polymer
        versus activity of the catalyst for the different runs of Catalyst A and Catalyst
        B. MFR is measured for the polyethylene according to ASTM D 1238 (190\xB0
        C./2.16 kg). Activity is measured in kilograms of polyethylene per gram of
        polymerization catalyst-hour. From <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 1</figref>,
        it can be seen that the metallocene catalyst (Catalyst A) had a better molecular
        weight capacity.<br />Example 2<br />[0087] Additional series of ethylene
        polymerization runs were conducted in the bench-scale slurry-phase reactor
        using Catalyst A. For each run, the slurry comprised ethylene and a co-monomer
        in a propane diluent (1350 ml). The co-monomer included in the slurry was
        1-hexene in amounts of 12 to 37 ml. The ethylene concentration in the loop
        reactor was 12 mol %. The reactor was operated at 80\xB0 C. 38 bar pressure.
        Hydrogen was added to the reactor for a partial pressure of 0.5 bar (12 ml
        1-hexene addition). The concentration of the co-monomer was adjusted to provide
        a polymer with an MFR (190\xB0 C./2.16 kg) of 210 g/10 min. The polymerizations
        were each conducted for 60 minutes. The resultant polymer had a low bulk density
        (140 g/cm.sup.3). <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 2</figref> is a graph
        showing concentration of 1-hexene versus activity of the catalyst for the
        different runs of Catalyst A.<br />Example 3<br />[0088] Ethylene was polymerized
        in a pilot-scale multi-stage polymerization process using either Catalyst
        A or Catalyst B. A loop reactor was operated at 85\xB0 C. and 65 bar pressure.
        Into the loop reactor, ethylene, a co-monomer (1-butene), a propane diluent,
        and a polymerization catalyst were added so that a target of 35 kg/hr of polyethylene
        was produced. Hydrogen was added to the loop reactor for certain runs with
        Catalyst A to produce a polymer with an MFR (190\xB0 C./2.16 kg) in the range
        of 0.8 to 1.2 but not with Catalyst B. Trisiobutylaluminum was added at a
        rate of 0.5 g/hr. The concentration of ethylene in the loop reactor was from
        4-5 mol %. The mole ratio of the 1-butene co-monomer to ethylene in the loop
        reactor was 50 mol/kmol. The residence time in the loop reactor was 60 minutes.
        The polymer containing the polymerization catalyst was separated from the
        reaction media and transferred to a gas-phase reactor where additional ethylene,
        1-hexene co-monomer, and hydrogen (for Catalyst A runs) were added so that
        a target of 35 kg/hr of polyethylene was produced. The gas-phase reactor was
        operated at 80\xB0 C. and 20 bar pressure with an ethylene concentration of
        30 mol %. The mole ratio of the 1-hexene co-monomer to ethylene in the gas-phase
        reactor was 50 mol/kmol. Trisiobutylaluminum was added at a rate of 2 g/hr.
        The residence time in the gas-phase reactor was 3 hours. The target production
        rate for the overall process was 70 kg/hr. The target MFR (190\xB0 C./2.16
        kg) of the resultant polymer was 1 g/10 min. The target density of the resultant
        polymer was 918 g/cm.sup.3.<br />[0089] The polyethylene sample produced using
        Catalyst A in the multi-stage polymerization process with an MFR (190\xB0
        C./2.16 kg) of 1.2 g/10 min had a density of 917.2 g/cm.sup.3, a Mn of 37
        kiloDaltons, a Mw of 97 kiloDaltons, and a Mw/Mn of 2.6.<br />[0090] <figref

        kg) of the resultant polymer versus catalyst productivity for the different
        runs of Catalyst A and Catalyst B in the loop reactor. As previously mentioned,
        no hydrogen was used for the runs with Catalyst B. Catalyst productivity is
        measured in kilograms of polyethylene per gram of polymerization catalyst.
        The catalyst productivity in the loop reactor was approximately 0.8 kg/g for
        each run. <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 4</figref> is a graph showing
        MFR of the resultant polymer versus catalyst productivity for the different
        runs of Catalyst A and Catalyst B in the gas-phase reactor. No hydrogen was
        used for the runs with Catalyst B or the run for Catalyst A with MFR of approximately
        0.3 g/10 min. Catalyst productivity is measured in kilograms of polyethylene
        per gram of polymerization catalyst. The catalyst productivity in the gas-phase
        reactor was approximately 0.8 kg/g for each run. The overall productivity
        for the multi-stage process was approximately 1.6 kg/g.<br />[0091] <figref

        (log) of molecular weight (MW) versus d(wt %)/d(log MW), wherein d(wt %) is

        the base ten logarithm (log) of molecular weight (MW) for the 1.2 MFR product
        from the series reactors. Weight percent as a function of molecular weight
        molecular weight are determined by gel permeation chromatograph.<br />Example

        slurry reactor in the 5 mol % to 8 mol % range and the 1-butene-to-ethylene
        ratio of about 0.062 mol/Kmol, and the ethylene concentration in the gas phase
        reactor increased from 30 mol % ethylene to 60 to 65 mol %. The catalyst productivity
        increased from 1.6 kg/g to about 4 kg/g.<br />[0093] While compositions, methods,

        />[0001] The invention generally relates to processes for the polymerization
        of olefins. More particularly, embodiments disclosed herein relate to multi-stage
        polymerization processes that produce polymers having controlled compositions
        and molecular weight with improved catalyst productivity.<br />BACKGROUND<br
        />[0002] Advances in polymerization and catalysts have produced new polymers
        having improved physical and mechanical properties useful in a wide variety
        of products and applications. With the development of new catalysts, the choice
        of polymerization, such as solution, slurry, high pressure, or gas phase,
        for producing a particular polymer has been greatly expanded. Advances in
        polymerization technology have also provided more efficient, highly productive
        and economically enhanced processes.<br />[0003] Multimodal polymers are known
        to be useful for making a variety of commercial products such as films, pipe,
        and blow molding products. In general, a multimodal polymer has at least two
        (e.g., two, three or more) molecular weight fractions, and a molecular weight
        distribution that determines a different identifiable molecular weight for
        each molecular weight fraction. For example, a multimodal polymer may have
        at least one low molecular weight fraction and at least one high molecular
        weight fraction, and a molecular weight distribution that determines an identifiable
        (relatively high) molecular weight for the high molecular weight fraction
        and another identifiable (relatively low) molecular weight for the low molecular
        weight fraction. A composition comprising only two molecular weight fractions
        is referred to as \u201Cbimodal.\u201D<br />[0004] A number of different techniques
        have been developed to produce multimodal polymers. One such technique uses
        a suitable polymerization catalyst to broaden the molecular weight distribution
        in the resultant polymer. Multi-stage polymerization processes have also been
        used in which different hydrogen concentrations may be used in the different
        stages to broaden the molecular weight distribution of the resultant polymer.
        Examples of multi-stage polymerization processes include slurry-phase-slurry-phase
        processes, gas-phase-gas-phase processes, and slurry-phase-slurry-phase processes.
        One particular process for producing a bimodal polymer utilizes a loop reactor
        and a gas-phase reactor arranged in series. Despite their use in commercial
        products, multimodal polymers still desire improvements in their production
        processes as current processes may lack adequate molecular weight control.
        Improved control of molecular weight control may beneficial for producing
        polyolefins suitable for a number of different applications, including blown
        and cast film applications.<br />SUMMARY<br />[0005] Disclosed herein is an
        example method for producing a multi-modal polyolefin that comprises polymerizing
