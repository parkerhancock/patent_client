      unit <b>14</b> which is serving as an air-conditioning device main body that
      forms an air-conditioning device. The HVAC unit <b>14</b> is disposed at a vehicle
      front-lower side of an instrument panel <b>16</b> of the vehicle <b>12</b>.
      The HVAC unit <b>14</b> is provided with a main fan <b>18</b>, and an airflow
      W is generated as a result of the main fan <b>18</b> being operated. An evaporator
      <b>20</b> and a heater core <b>22</b> and the like are provided on a downstream
      side of the airflow W (i.e., on the vehicle rear side in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG.
      <b>2</b></figref>) from the main fan <b>18</b>, so that the airflow W forms
      conditioned air whose temperature and humidity and the like have been conditioned.<br
      />(10) One end of a front face duct <b>24</b> is connected to the HVAC unit
      <b>14</b>. Another end of the front face duct <b>24</b> is connected to a front
      face blower portion <b>26</b>. The front face blower portion <b>26</b> is provided
      at a vehicle rear-side portion of the instrument panel <b>16</b>, and the airflow
      W flowing from the HVAC unit <b>14</b> towards the front face duct <b>24</b>
      is blown as an airflow W<b>1</b>, which is serving as conditioned air, towards
      the vehicle rear side from the front face blower portion <b>26</b>. As a result,
      the airflow W<b>1</b> flows towards an upper body of a front-side vehicle occupant
      <b>28</b> (for example, towards the vicinity of a facial area of the front-side
      vehicle occupant <b>28</b>) who is sitting at the front seat <b>10</b>.<br />(11)
      In addition, one end of a rear face duct <b>30</b> is connected to the HVAC
      unit <b>14</b>. Another end side of the duct <b>30</b> is disposed at the vehicle
      lower side of a center console <b>32</b>. The center console <b>32</b> is provided
      between one front seat <b>10</b> which is serving as a driver''s seat, and another
      front seat <b>10</b> which is serving as a front passenger''s seat, and the
      other end side of the rear face duct <b>30</b> extends towards the vehicle rear
      side at the vehicle lower side of the center console <b>32</b>.<br />(12) The
      other end of the rear face duct <b>30</b> is connected to a rear face blower
      portion <b>34</b>. The rear face blower portion <b>34</b> is disposed at an
      upper-side portion of a vehicle rear-side end portion of the center console
      <b>32</b>. The airflow W (for example, cool air) flowing from the HVAC unit
      <b>14</b> towards the rear face duct <b>30</b> is blown as an airflow W<b>2</b>
      from the rear face blower portion <b>34</b> towards the vehicle upper rear side.
      As a result, the airflow W<b>2</b> flows towards an upper body of a rear-side
      vehicle occupant <b>38</b> who is sitting at the rear seat <b>36</b>.<br />(13)
      One end of a rear foot duct <b>40</b> is connected to the HVAC unit <b>14</b>.
      Another end of the rear foot duct <b>40</b> is connected to a rear foot blower
      portion <b>42</b>. The rear foot blower portion <b>42</b> is provided, for example,
      at the vehicle lower side of a vehicle rear-side end portion of the front seat
      <b>10</b>. The airflow W (for example, warm air) flowing from the HVAC unit
      <b>14</b> towards the rear foot duct <b>40</b> is blown as an airflow W<b>3</b>
      from the rear foot blower portion <b>42</b> towards the vehicle rear side. As
      a result, the airflow W<b>3</b> flows towards the feet of the rear-side vehicle
      occupant <b>38</b>.<br />(14) A switching module <b>44</b>, which is serving
      as a switching device, is provided at the respective one end sides of the above-described
      rear face duct <b>30</b> and rear foot duct <b>40</b>. The switching module
      <b>44</b> is provided, for example, with a damper. The damper is mechanically
      connected, for example, to a damper motor via a deceleration mechanism (neither
      of these are shown in the drawings), and the damper is moved reciprocatingly
      by drive force from the damper motor.<br />(15) As a result of the damper being
      moved to one side of a range of this reciprocating motion, the switching module
      <b>44</b> is placed in a first state. In this first state, either all of or
      a large majority of the one end of the rear face duct <b>30</b> is closed off
      by the damper, while the one end of the rear foot duct <b>40</b> is opened up.
      As a result, either all of or a large majority of the airflow W (for example,
      warm air) produced by the HVAC unit <b>14</b> and flowing to the vicinity of
      the one end of the rear foot duct <b>40</b> and the one end of the rear face
      duct <b>30</b> flows to the rear foot duct <b>40</b>.<br />(16) In contrast
      to the first state of the damper, in a second state of the damper, the one ends
      of both the rear face duct <b>30</b> and the rear foot duct <b>40</b> are partially
      opened by the damper. As a result, the airflow W (for example, cool air) produced
      by the HVAC unit <b>14</b> and flowing to the vicinity of the one end of the
      rear face duct <b>30</b> and the one end of the rear foot duct <b>40</b> is
      split so as to flow to both the rear face duct <b>30</b> and the rear foot duct
      <b>40</b>.<br />(17) The vehicle <b>12</b> is also provided with a seat ventilation
      system <b>50</b>. The seat ventilation system <b>50</b> is provided with a branch
      duct <b>52</b>. One end of the branch duct <b>52</b> is connected to roughly
      an intermediate portion of the rear foot duct <b>40</b> at the vehicle lower
      side of the front seat <b>10</b>.<br />(18) Another end of the branch duct <b>52</b>
      is connected to a seat lower-side fan <b>54</b> which is serving as a blower
      device. When operated, the seat lower-side fan <b>54</b> suctions air on a branch
      duct <b>52</b> side. Because of this, when the seat lower-side fan <b>54</b>
      is operated, at least a portion of the airflow W flowing through the rear foot
      duct <b>40</b> flows into the branch duct <b>52</b> as an airflow W<b>4</b>
      so that the flow of the airflow W towards the rear foot blower portion <b>42</b>
      side is either prevented or inhibited. Additionally, one end of a seat-side
      duct <b>56</b> is connected to the seat lower-side fan <b>54</b>. Air suctioned
      by the seat lower-side fan <b>54</b>, namely, the airflow W<b>4</b> is supplied
      to the seat-side duct <b>56</b> and flows through the seat-side duct <b>56</b><br
      />(19) Another end of the seat-side duct <b>56</b> is connected to one end of
      a seat interior duct <b>58</b> that forms part of a flow path <b>51</b>. The
      seat interior duct <b>58</b> is provided at an inner side of a seat cushion
      <b>60</b> that forms part of a seat main body of the front seat <b>10</b> and
      at an inner side of a seat back <b>62</b> that forms part of the seat main body
      of the front seat <b>10</b>. One end of the seat interior duct <b>58</b> opens
      onto a vehicle lower side end of the seat cushion <b>60</b>. Here, the seat-side
      duct <b>56</b> is formed, for example, in a bellows shape. Because of this,
      it is possible for the seat-side duct <b>56</b> to be deformed in such a way
      that the other end-side portion of the seat-side duct <b>56</b> moves in the
      vehicle front-rear direction and in the vehicle up-down direction relative to
      the one end-side portion of the seat-side duct <b>56</b>. As a consequence of
      this, without the position of the one end of the seat-side duct <b>56</b> being
      changed, the other end of the seat-side duct <b>56</b> is able to follow movement
      of the front seat <b>10</b> in the vehicle front-rear direction and in the vehicle
      up-down direction.<br />(20) As is shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG.
      <b>4</b></figref>, another end side of the seat interior duct <b>58</b> is disposed
      between a pad central portion <b>66</b> of a seat pad <b>64</b>, that forms
      part of the seat back <b>62</b> of the front seat <b>10</b>, and a back plate
      portion <b>70</b> of a backboard <b>68</b>. The other end portion of the seat
      interior duct <b>58</b> is connected to one end of a left-side duct <b>72</b>,
      that forms part of the flow path <b>51</b>, and a right-side duct <b>74</b>,
      that also forms part of the flow path <b>51</b>.<br />(21) Another end side
      of the left-side duct <b>72</b> extends towards the left side in the vehicle
      width direction, and the other end portion of the left-side duct <b>72</b> is
      disposed between a pad side portion <b>76</b> of the seat pad <b>64</b> and
      a side plate portion <b>78</b> of the backboard <b>68</b> at the left side in
      the vehicle width direction. A portion of the airflow W<b>4</b> passing through
      the seat interior duct <b>58</b> can be made to flow through an inside of the
      left-side duct <b>72</b> as an airflow W<b>5</b> and blown out towards the vehicle
      front side from the other end of the left-side duct <b>72</b>.<br />(22) A portion
      between a vehicle front-side end of the side plate portion <b>78</b> of the
      backboard <b>68</b> and the pad side portion <b>76</b> of the seat pad <b>64</b>
      forms a left-side blower portion <b>80</b> which is serving as a blower portion
      at the left side in the vehicle width direction. The airflow W<b>5</b> that
      is blown out from the other end of the left-side duct <b>72</b> is blown from
      the left-side blower portion <b>80</b> towards the vehicle front side, and flows
      towards the vehicle front side along a surface on the left side in the vehicle
      width direction of the pad side portion <b>76</b>.<br />(23) In contrast to
      this, another end side of the right-side duct <b>74</b> extends towards the
      right side in the vehicle width direction, and the other end portion of the
      right-side duct <b>74</b> is disposed between the pad side portion <b>76</b>
      of the seat pad <b>64</b> and the side plate portion <b>78</b> of the backboard
      <b>68</b> at the right side in the vehicle width direction. A portion of the
      airflow W<b>4</b> passing through the seat interior duct <b>58</b> can be made
      to flow through an inside of the right-side duct <b>74</b> as an airflow W<b>6</b>
      and blown out towards the vehicle front side from the other end of the right-side
      duct <b>74</b>.<br />(24) A portion between a vehicle front-side end of the
      side plate portion <b>78</b> of the backboard <b>68</b> and the pad side portion
      <b>76</b> of the seat pad <b>64</b> forms a right-side blower portion <b>82</b>
      which is serving as a blower portion at the right side in the vehicle width
      direction. The airflow W<b>6</b> that is blown out from the other end of the
      right-side duct <b>74</b> is blown from the right-side blower portion <b>82</b>
      towards the vehicle front side, and flows towards the vehicle front side along
      a surface on the right side in the vehicle width direction of the pad side portion
      <b>76</b>.<br />(25) In addition, as is shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG.
      <b>3</b></figref>, the seat ventilation system <b>50</b> is provided with a
      seat cushion fan <b>84</b>, which is serving as an intake device, and a seat
      back fan <b>86</b> which is also serving as an intake device. The seat cushion
      fan <b>84</b> is provided inside the seat cushion <b>60</b> of the front seat
      <b>10</b>. When operated, the seat cushion fan <b>84</b> attempts to take in
      air from the vehicle upper side (i.e., the seat upper side) of the seat cushion
      fan <b>84</b>. Here, the upholstery covering of the seat cushion <b>60</b> is
      formed from a breathable fabric. Alternatively, if the upholstery covering of
      the seat cushion <b>60</b> is formed from a barely breathable material such
      as leather or the like, then a number of micro holes are formed penetrating
      the upholstery covering in the thickness direction thereof.<br />(26) Because
      of this, when the seat cushion fan <b>84</b> is operated, and air at the vehicle
      upper side of the seat cushion fan <b>84</b> is taken in by the seat cushion
      fan <b>84</b>, an airflow (not shown in the drawings) is generated flowing from
      the vehicle upper side of the seat cushion <b>60</b> through the upholstery
      covering and cushion material of the seat cushion <b>60</b> towards the vehicle
      lower side. Accordingly, if the seat cushion fan <b>84</b> is operated while,
      for example, the front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b> is sitting at the front
      seat <b>10</b>, then an airflow (not shown in the drawings) is generated passing
      from the vehicle front-upper side, the vehicle left-upper side, and the vehicle
      right-upper side and the like of the seat cushion <b>60</b> over the thigh and
      buttock portions of the front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b>.<br />(27) A portion
      of the airflow W<b>1</b> blown from the front face blower portion <b>26</b>
      towards the vehicle rear side merges with the airflow generated by the operation
      of the seat cushion fan <b>84</b>. As a consequence, a portion of the airflow
      W<b>1</b> flows onto the thigh and buttock portions of the front-side vehicle
      occupant <b>28</b>. As a result, if the airflow W<b>1</b> is cool air, then
      a cooling sensation can be effectively imparted to the thigh and buttock portions
      of the front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b>.<br />(28) In contrast to this,
      the seat back fan <b>86</b> is provided inside the seat back <b>62</b> of the
      front seat <b>10</b>. When operated, the seat back fan <b>86</b> attempts to
      take in air from the vehicle front side of the seat back fan <b>86</b>. Here,
      the upholstery covering of the seat back <b>62</b> is formed from a breathable
      fabric. Alternatively, if the upholstery covering of the seat back <b>62</b>
      is formed from a barely breathable material such as leather or the like, then
      a number of micro holes are formed penetrating the upholstery covering in the
      thickness direction thereof.<br />(29) Because of this, when the seat back fan
      <b>86</b> is operated, and air at the vehicle front side of the seat back fan
      <b>86</b> is taken in by the seat back fan <b>86</b>, an airflow is generated
      flowing from the vehicle upper side of the seat cushion <b>60</b> through the
      upholstery covering and cushion material of the seat back <b>62</b> towards
      the vehicle lower side. Accordingly, as is shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG.
      <b>4</b></figref>, if the seat back fan <b>86</b> is operated while, for example,
      the front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b> is sitting in the front seat <b>10</b>,
      then an airflow W<b>7</b> is generated passing from the vehicle front-left side
      and the vehicle front-right side and the like of the seat back <b>62</b> over
      both sides in the vehicle width direction of the body of the front-side vehicle
      occupant <b>28</b>.<br />(30) At least a portion of each of the airflow W<b>1</b>
      blown from the front face blower portion <b>26</b> toward the vehicle rear side,
      and the respective airflows W<b>5</b> and W<b>6</b> flowing towards the vehicle
      front side along both side surfaces in the vehicle width direction of the pad
      side portion <b>76</b> merges with the airflow W<b>7</b> generated by the operation
      of the seat back fan <b>86</b>. As a consequence, at least a portion of each
      of the airflows W<b>1</b>, W<b>5</b>, and W<b>6</b> flows onto the thigh and
      buttock portions of the front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b>. As a result,
      if the airflows W<b>1</b>, W<b>5</b>, and W<b>6</b> are cool air, then a cooling
      sensation can be effectively imparted to both side portions in the vehicle width
      direction and the like of the body of the front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b>.<br
      />(31) On the other hand, as is shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>
      and <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a rear-side duct <b>90</b>
      that forms part of the flow path <b>51</b> is provided in the vicinity of the
      other end portion of the seat interior duct <b>58</b>. As is shown in <figref
      idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, one end of the rear-side duct <b>90</b>
      is connected from the vehicle rear side to the seat interior duct <b>58</b>
      at a location where the one end portions of each of the left-side duct <b>72</b>
      and the right-side duct <b>74</b> are connected to the other end portion of
      the seat interior duct <b>58</b>. Because of this, a portion of the airflow
      W<b>4</b> passing through the seat interior duct <b>58</b> can be made to flow
      through an inside of the rear-side duct <b>90</b> as an airflow W<b>8</b> which
      is serving as conditioned air.<br />(32) Another end of the rear-side duct <b>90</b>
      is open, and is connected to the backboard <b>68</b> from the vehicle front
      side. An aperture <b>92</b> that corresponds to the other end of the rear-side
      duct <b>90</b> is formed at the backboard <b>68</b>. The aperture <b>92</b>
      is formed, for example, in a substantially rectangular shape that is elongated
      in the vehicle width direction, and is disposed further towards a vehicle upper
      side from the upper-side end of the vehicle rear-side end portion of the center
      console <b>32</b> (namely, at the vehicle upper side of the rear face blower
      portion <b>34</b> provided in the center console <b>32</b>). The airflow W<b>8</b>
      flowing through the inside of the rear-side duct <b>90</b> is blown towards
      the vehicle rear side of the seat back <b>62</b> by passing through the other
      end of the rear-side duct <b>90</b> and the aperture <b>92</b>.<br />(33) Furthermore,
      a cup holder <b>94</b>, which is serving as an opening/closing device, is provided
      at the backboard <b>68</b>. The cup holder <b>94</b> is provided with a plate
      <b>96</b> which is serving as a placement portion. The plate <b>96</b> is formed
      in a substantially rectangular, flat plate shape that is elongated in the vehicle
      width direction. A pair of side plates <b>98</b> are provided at both sides
      in the vehicle width direction, and on one side in the thickness direction of
      the plate <b>96</b>. These side plates <b>98</b> are formed in a planar shape,
      and the thickness direction of the respective side plates <b>98</b> is set along
      the longitudinal direction of the plate <b>96</b> (in other words, as the seat
      width direction). One side plate <b>98</b> is withdrawn to the right side in
      the vehicle width direction from an end at the left side of the plate <b>96</b>,
      and stands upright from the surface on one side in the thickness direction of
      the plate <b>96</b>. In contrast, the other side plate <b>98</b> is withdrawn
      to the left side in the vehicle width direction from an end at the right side
      of the plate <b>96</b>, and stands upright from the surface on the one side
      in the thickness direction of the plate <b>96</b>.<br />(34) An interval between
      the left and right side plates <b>98</b> is set shorter than a dimension in
      the longitudinal direction of the aperture <b>92</b> (i.e., in the vehicle width
      direction) in the backboard <b>68</b>, while a dimension in the longitudinal
      direction of each side plate <b>98</b> is set shorter than a dimension in the
      width direction of the aperture <b>92</b>. Because of this, the two side plates
      <b>98</b> can be disposed at the inner side of the aperture <b>92</b> in such
      a way that the longitudinal direction of each side plate <b>98</b> extends in
      the width direction of the aperture <b>92</b>.<br />(35) Furthermore, when the
      thickness direction of the plate <b>96</b> is extending roughly in the vehicle
      up-down direction, then the longitudinal direction of the two side plates <b>98</b>
      extends roughly in the vehicle front-rear direction. One end portions in the
      longitudinal direction of the two side plates <b>98</b>, which are the end portions
      at the vehicle front sides thereof when the two side plates <b>98</b> are in
      this state, are joined to the backboard <b>68</b> at vehicle lower-side end
      portions of the aperture <b>92</b>. Moreover, the two side plates <b>98</b>
      are rotatable in directions around an axis (i.e., in the direction shown by
      an arrow A and a direction shown by an arrow B in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG.
      <b>1</b></figref>) centered on the portions where the two side plates <b>98</b>
      are joined to the backboard <b>68</b>, with the axial direction of this rotation
      extending in the vehicle width direction.<br />(36) As a result of the two side
      plates <b>98</b> being rotated in a closing direction (i.e., in the direction
      shown by the arrow A in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>),
      the two side plates <b>98</b> can be inserted inside the aperture <b>92</b>
      in the backboard <b>68</b>. In this way, in a closed state which is when the
      two side plates <b>98</b> have been placed inside the aperture <b>92</b>, the
      thickness direction of the plate <b>96</b> of the cup holder <b>94</b> extends
      roughly in the vehicle front-rear direction, and the aperture <b>92</b> is covered
      from the vehicle rear side by the plate <b>96</b> and is closed off.<br />(37)
      Additionally, a pair of supporting mechanisms <b>100</b> are provided at the
      cup holder <b>94</b>. Each supporting mechanism <b>100</b> is provided with
      a pair of arms <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. These arms <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>
      are formed in a flat plate shape, and the thickness direction of the arms <b>102</b>
      and <b>104</b> is set as the vehicle width direction. One end portion in the
      longitudinal direction of the arms <b>102</b> is joined to another end portion
      in the longitudinal direction of the arms <b>104</b>, and the arms <b>102</b>
      are able to rotate relatively in directions around an axis centered on the portions
      where the arms <b>102</b> are joined to the arms <b>104</b>, with the axial
      direction of this rotation extending in the thickness direction of the arms
      <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>.<br />(38) Another end portion in the longitudinal
      direction of the arm <b>102</b> is joined to the backboard <b>68</b> at the
      upper-left side in the vehicle width direction at the inner side of the aperture
      <b>92</b>. In addition, one end portion in the longitudinal direction of the
      arm <b>104</b> is joined to the other end portion in the longitudinal direction
      of the side plate <b>98</b> on the left side in the vehicle width direction.
      In contrast, another end portion in the longitudinal direction of the arm <b>102</b>
      of the other supporting mechanism <b>100</b> is joined to the backboard <b>68</b>
      at the upper-right side in the vehicle width direction at the inner side of
      the aperture <b>92</b>. In addition, one end portion in the longitudinal direction
      of the arm <b>104</b> is joined to the other end portion in the longitudinal
      direction of the side plate <b>98</b> on the right side in the vehicle width
      direction.<br />(39) Furthermore, the arms <b>102</b> of the two supporting
      mechanisms <b>100</b> are able to be rotated relative to the backboard <b>68</b>
      in directions around an axis (i.e., in the direction shown by an arrow C and
      a direction shown by an arrow D in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>)
      centered on the portions where the arms <b>102</b> are joined to the backboard
      <b>68</b>, with the axial direction of this rotation extending in the vehicle
      width direction. In contrast to this, the arms <b>104</b> of the two supporting
      mechanisms <b>100</b> are able to be rotated relative to the side plates <b>98</b>
      in directions around an axis (i.e., in the direction shown by an arrow E and
      a direction shown by an arrow F in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>)
      centered on the portions where the arms <b>104</b> are joined to the side plates
      <b>98</b>, with the axial direction of this rotation extending in the vehicle
      width direction.<br />(40) If the two side plates <b>98</b> of the cup holder
      <b>94</b> are rotated in the closing direction (i.e., in the direction shown
      by the arrow A in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) around
      the portion where the side plates <b>98</b> are joined to the backboard <b>68</b>,
      the arms <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> are also rotated relatively. As a result
      of this, the arms <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> become folded such that the other
      end portion in the longitudinal direction of the arms <b>102</b> and the one
      end portion in the longitudinal direction of the arms <b>104</b> are mutually
      facing each other in the vehicle width direction, and are housed in this state
      inside the aperture <b>92</b>. When the aperture <b>92</b> is opened up from
      this closed state, the cup holder <b>94</b> is rotated in an opening direction
      (i.e., in the direction shown by the arrow B in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG.
      <b>1</b></figref>) towards the vehicle lower-rear side around the join portion
      where the side plates <b>98</b> are joined to the backboard <b>68</b>.<br />(41)
      In conjunction with the rotation of the cup holder <b>94</b> in the opening
      direction, the arms <b>102</b> are rotated relatively to the arms <b>104</b>
      around the join portions where the arms <b>102</b> are joined to the arms <b>104</b>
      such that the other end portions in the longitudinal direction of the arms <b>102</b>
      move away from the one end portions in the longitudinal direction of the arms
      <b>104</b>. When the join portions where the arms <b>102</b> are joined to the
      backboard <b>68</b>, and the join portions where the arms <b>102</b> are joined
      to the arms <b>104</b>, and the join portions where the arms <b>104</b> are
      joined to the side plates <b>98</b> are located at respective straight lines,
      then any further rotation in the opening direction of the cup holder <b>94</b>
      is restricted, and the cup holder <b>94</b> is in its open state.<br />(42)
      In this open state, the other end side in the longitudinal direction of the
      side plates <b>98</b> of the cup holder <b>94</b> are supported at the backboard
      <b>68</b> via the two supporting mechanisms <b>100</b>. In this state, the thickness
      direction of the plate <b>96</b> is roughly the same as the vehicle up-down
      direction, and a plastic drink bottle <b>106</b>, which is serving as a type
      of article, can be placed on the plate <b>96</b>.<br />(43) In addition, the
      cup holder <b>94</b> is provided with an inhibiting portion <b>108</b>. The
      inhibiting portion <b>108</b> is formed in a substantially rectangular plate
      shape that is elongated in the vehicle width direction. Both ends in the longitudinal
      direction of the inhibiting portion <b>108</b> are joined to end portions of
      the side plates <b>98</b> on the opposite side from the end portions thereof
      where the plate <b>96</b> is joined so that the inhibiting portion <b>108</b>
      is disposed facing the plate <b>96</b> while being separated from the plate
      <b>96</b>. A circular hole <b>110</b> is formed at the inhibiting portion <b>108</b>.
      A dimension of an inner diameter of the circular hole <b>110</b> is formed,
      for example, slightly larger than a dimension of an external diameter of a typical
      plastic drink bottle <b>106</b>. Because of this, when the cup holder <b>94</b>
      is in the open state, the plastic drink bottle <b>106</b> can be placed on the
      plate <b>96</b> of the cup holder <b>94</b> with the plastic drink bottle <b>106</b>
      inserted inside the circular hole <b>110</b>.<br />Action and Effects of the
      First Exemplary Embodiment<br />(44) In the vehicle <b>12</b> in which the present
      front seat <b>10</b> has been applied, if, for example, the HVAC unit <b>14</b>
      is operated in cooling mode, cool air is produced in the HVAC unit <b>14</b>
      as an airflow W of conditioned air. A portion of the airflow W flows through
      the front face duct <b>24</b>, and is blown as the airflow W<b>1</b> towards
      the vehicle rear side from the front face blower portion <b>26</b>. As a result,
      the airflow W<b>1</b> can be blown towards the upper body of the front-side
      vehicle occupant <b>28</b>, for example, towards the vicinity of the face portion
      of the front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b> who is sitting at the front seat
      <b>10</b>, so that a cooling sensation can be imparted to the front-side vehicle
      occupant <b>28</b>.<br />(45) Moreover, in this state, the damper of the switching
      module <b>44</b> is set to the second state. In this state, the one ends of
      both the rear face duct <b>30</b> and the rear foot duct <b>40</b> are partially
      opened by the damper. As a result, the airflow W is split so as to flow to both
      the rear face duct <b>30</b> and the rear foot duct <b>40</b>.<br />(46) The
      airflow W flows through the rear face duct <b>30</b> and is then blown out towards
      the vehicle upper-rear side from the rear face blower portion <b>34</b>, provided
      at the upper side portion of the vehicle rear side end portion of the center
      console <b>32</b>, as the airflow W<b>2</b>. As a result, the airflow W<b>2</b>
      can be blown towards the upper body of the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b>
      who is sitting at the rear seat <b>36</b>, so that a cooling sensation can be
      imparted to the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b>.<br />(47) On the other
      hand, in the second state of the damper of the switching module <b>44</b>, the
      airflow W also flows through the rear foot duct <b>40</b>. In this state, the
      seat lower-side fan <b>54</b> of the seat ventilation system <b>50</b> is operated.
      Because of this, either the large majority of or all of the airflow W flowing
      through the rear foot duct <b>40</b> is suctioned by the seat lower-side fan
      <b>54</b>. As a result, the airflow W<b>4</b> that flows to the branch duct
      <b>52</b> side flows through the branch duct <b>52</b> and the seat-side duct
      <b>56</b> and is then supplied to the seat interior duct <b>58</b>. The airflow
      W<b>4</b> then flows inside the seat interior duct <b>58</b> from one end side
      to the other end side of the seat interior duct <b>58</b>.<br />(48) A portion
      of the airflow W<b>4</b> that arrives at the other end portion of the seat interior
      duct <b>58</b> flows through the left-side duct <b>72</b> to the other end side
      of the left-side duct <b>72</b> as the airflow W<b>5</b>, and through the right-side
      duct <b>74</b> to the other end of the right-side duct <b>74</b> as the airflow
      W<b>6</b>. The airflow W<b>5</b> that is blown towards the vehicle front side
      from the other end of the left-side duct <b>72</b> is then blown from the left-side
      blower portion <b>80</b> further towards the vehicle front side, and this airflow
      W<b>5</b> flows towards the vehicle front side along the left-side surface in
      the vehicle width direction of the pad side portion <b>76</b>. In contrast to
      this, the airflow W<b>6</b> that is blown towards the vehicle front side from
      the other end of the right-side duct <b>74</b> is then blown from the right-side
      blower portion <b>82</b> further towards the vehicle front side, and this airflow
      W<b>6</b> flows towards the vehicle front side along the right-side surface
      in the vehicle width direction of the pad side portion <b>76</b>.<br />(49)
      Here, in this state, the seat cushion fan <b>84</b> and the seat back fan <b>86</b>
      of the seat ventilation system <b>50</b> are operated. As a result of the seat
      cushion fan <b>84</b> being operated, on the seat cushion <b>60</b> side of
      the front seat <b>10</b>, an airflow (not shown in the drawings) is generated
      passing from the vehicle front-upper side, the vehicle left-upper side, and
      the vehicle right-upper side and the like of the seat cushion <b>60</b> over
      the thigh and buttock portions of the front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b>.
      A portion of the airflow W<b>1</b> blown from the front face blower portion
      <b>26</b> towards the vehicle rear side merges with the airflow generated by
      the operation of the seat cushion fan <b>84</b>. As a consequence, a portion
      of the airflow W<b>1</b>, namely, of the cool air flows onto the thigh and buttock
      portions of the front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b>. As a result, a cooling
      sensation can be effectively imparted to the thigh and buttock portions of the
      front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b>.<br />(50) In contrast, as a result of
      the seat back fan <b>86</b> being operated, air on the vehicle front side of
      the seat back <b>62</b> is taken inside the seat back <b>62</b>. As a consequence,
      an airflow W<b>7</b> is generated that passes from the vehicle left-front side
      and the vehicle right-front side and the like of the seat back <b>62</b> over
      both sides in the vehicle width direction of the body of the front-side vehicle
      occupant <b>28</b>.<br />(51) At least a portion of the above-described airflows
      W<b>1</b>, W<b>5</b> and W<b>6</b> merges with the airflow W<b>7</b> generated
      by the operation of the seat back fan <b>86</b>. As a consequence, at least
      a portion of each of the airflows W<b>1</b>, W<b>5</b>, and W<b>6</b>, namely,
      of the cool air flows at both side portions in the vehicle width direction and
      the like of the body of the front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b>. As a result,
      a cooling sensation can be effectively imparted to the both side portions in
      the vehicle width direction of the body of the front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b>.<br
      />(52) In this state, if the cup holder <b>94</b> is then placed in the opened
      state, the aperture <b>92</b> of the backboard <b>68</b>, and as a consequence,
      the other end of the rear-side duct <b>90</b> are opened. In this state, a portion
      of the airflow W<b>4</b> that reaches the other end portion of the seat interior
      duct <b>58</b> flows through the interior of the rear-side duct <b>90</b> as
      the airflow W<b>8</b> to the other end side of the rear-side duct <b>90</b>.
      As a result, the airflow W<b>8</b> is blown out towards the vehicle rear side
      from the aperture <b>92</b> in the backboard <b>68</b>. As a result, the airflow
      W<b>8</b>, namely, the cool air can be blown onto the upper body of the rear-side
      vehicle occupant <b>38</b> who is sitting at the rear seat <b>36</b>, and a
      cooling sensation can be imparted to the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b>.<br
      />(53) Moreover, when the damper of the switching module <b>44</b> is in the
      second state, the airflow W generated in the HVAC unit <b>14</b> (namely, the
      cool air) is split so as to flow to both the rear face duct <b>30</b> and the
      rear foot duct <b>40</b>. Additionally, in this state, the seat lower-side fan
      <b>54</b> of the seat ventilation system <b>50</b> is operated so that the airflow
      W is forcibly suctioned from the rear foot duct <b>40</b> side. Because of this,
      the airflow W flowing through the rear face duct <b>30</b> is reduced, and the
      result of this is that the airflow W<b>2</b> blown out from the rear face blower
      portion <b>34</b> is also reduced.<br />(54) However, in the present exemplary
      embodiment the airflow W on the rear foot duct <b>40</b> side that has been
      suctioned into the seat lower-side fan <b>54</b> flows through the interior
      of the seat interior duct <b>58</b> as the airflow W<b>4</b>, and a portion
      of this airflow W<b>4</b> additionally flows from the other end portion of the
      seat interior duct <b>58</b> through the rear-side duct <b>90</b> as the airflow
      W<b>8</b>, and is then blown out from the aperture <b>92</b> of the backboard
      <b>68</b> towards the vehicle rear side. As a result, a sufficient quantity
      of cool air, namely, the airflow W<b>2</b> and the airflow W<b>8</b>, can be
      blown onto the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b>, and a cooling sensation
      can be effectively imparted to the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b>.<br
      />(55) In other words, when, for example, the damper of the switching module
      <b>44</b> is in the second state, and when an airflow W having a flow rate of,
      for example, 10 is generated in the HVAC unit <b>14</b>, out of this flow rate
      of 10, an airflow W having a flow rate of, for example, 4 flows through the
      rear face duct <b>30</b>, and an airflow W having a flow rate of 6 flows through
      the rear foot duct <b>40</b>. Accordingly, in this case, although an airflow
      W having a flow rate of 10 is generated in the HVAC unit <b>14</b>, an airflow
      W having a flow rate of only 4 flows to the rear face duct <b>30</b>.<br />(56)
      On the other hand, in this case, an airflow W having a flow rate of 6 flows
      to the rear foot duct <b>40</b>. Out of this airflow W having a flow rate of
      6, an airflow W having a flow rate of, for example, 5 flows through the interior
      of the seat interior duct <b>58</b> as the airflow W<b>4</b>. Moreover, out
      of this airflow W<b>4</b> having a flow rate of 5, an airflow W<b>4</b> having
      a flow rate of 2 flows through the rear-side duct <b>90</b> as the airflow W<b>8</b>.
      Accordingly, although an airflow W having a flow rate of only 4 flows to the
      rear face duct <b>30</b>, the airflow W<b>8</b> having a flow rate of 2 flows
      through the rear-side duct <b>90</b> and is blown out towards the vehicle rear
      side. Because of this, in this case, cool air having a flow rate of 6, namely,
      the sum of the flow rate of 4 of the airflow W<b>2</b> blown out from the rear
      face blower portion <b>34</b> and the flow rate of 2 of the airflow W<b>8</b>
      flowing through the rear side duct <b>90</b> can be blown onto the rear-side
      vehicle occupant <b>38</b>. Because of this, a cooling sensation can be more
      effectively imparted to the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b> compared with
      a structure in which only the airflow W<b>2</b> having a flow rate of 4 is blown
      through the rear face duct <b>30</b> onto the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b>.<br
      />(57) Furthermore, if the airflow W<b>2</b> is blown out from the rear face
      blower portion <b>34</b>, then this airflow W<b>2</b> becomes diffused before
      it reaches the body of the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b> who is sitting
      at an end side in the vehicle width direction of the rear seat <b>36</b> (i.e.,
      on a side closer to where one of the front seats <b>10</b> is placed than to
      the center in the vehicle width direction), and the force thereof is weakened.
      Here, the aperture <b>92</b> in the backboard <b>68</b> is provided at the vehicle
      front side of a sitting position at the end side in the vehicle width direction
      of the rear seat <b>36</b> (i.e., on a side closer to where one of the front
      seats <b>10</b> is placed than to the center in the vehicle width direction).<br
      />(58) Because of this, the aperture <b>92</b> in the backboard <b>68</b> is
      closer to the sitting position of the rear seat <b>36</b> than the rear face
      blower portion <b>34</b> provided at the center console <b>32</b> which is in
      the central portion in the vehicle width direction of the front seat <b>10</b>.
      Because of this, compared to the airflow W<b>2</b>, the airflow W<b>8</b> undergoes
      less diffusion prior to reaching the body of the rear-side vehicle occupant
      <b>38</b>, and the force of this airflow W<b>8</b> is maintained. In this way,
      by causing the airflow W<b>8</b> that has less diffusion and whose force is
      maintained to be blown onto the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b>, a cooling
      sensation can be effectively imparted to the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b>.<br
      />(59) Furthermore, the aperture <b>92</b> in the backboard <b>68</b> is provided
      at the vehicle upper side of the rear face blower portion <b>34</b> provided
      at the center console <b>32</b>. Because of this, the distance between the aperture
      <b>92</b> and the upper body portion of the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b>
      is made even closer than the distance between the rear face blower portion <b>34</b>
      and the upper body portion of the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b>. Because
      of this, the airflow W<b>8</b> undergoes less diffusion before reaching the
      upper body portion of the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b> than does the
      airflow W<b>2</b>, and the force thereof is also maintained. In this way, by
      causing the airflow W<b>8</b> that has less diffusion and whose force is maintained
      to be blown onto the upper body portion of the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b>,
      a cooling sensation can be effectively imparted to the rear-side vehicle occupant
      <b>38</b>.<br />(60) Furthermore, as has been described above, when the cup
      holder <b>94</b> is in an open state, an article such as the plastic drink bottle
      <b>106</b> or the like can be placed on the plate <b>96</b> of the cup holder
      <b>94</b>. In this state, the airflow W<b>8</b>, which is cool air, is blown
      out from the aperture <b>92</b> in the backboard <b>68</b>. Because of this,
      the plastic drink bottle <b>106</b> and, in turn, the drink inside the plastic
      drink bottle <b>106</b> can be chilled.<br />(61) Additionally, the plastic
      drink bottle <b>106</b> is inserted through the inner side of the circular hole
      <b>110</b> in the inhibiting portion <b>108</b> of the cup holder <b>94</b>.
      In this state, if the plastic drink bottle <b>106</b> is moved in the vehicle
      front-rear direction or in the vehicle width direction so that, as a result,
      the outer circumferential portion of the plastic drink bottle <b>106</b> comes
      up against the inner circumferential portion of the circular hole <b>110</b>,
      then any further movement of the plastic drink bottle <b>106</b> in the vehicle
      front-rear direction or in the vehicle width direction is inhibited. As a result,
      the attitude of the plastic drink bottle <b>106</b> on the late 96 can be kept
      stable.<br />(62) Furthermore, if no rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b> is
      sitting at the rear seat <b>36</b> so that, as a consequence, the aperture <b>92</b>
      in the backboard <b>68</b> is closed off by the cup holder <b>94</b>, the passage
      of the airflow W<b>8</b> through the aperture <b>92</b> is inhibited (or prevented).
      Accordingly, in this state, the airflow W<b>8</b> passing through the interior
      of the rear-side duct <b>90</b> is either reduced or stopped. As a result, the
      airflow W<b>5</b> flowing through the left-side duct <b>72</b> and the airflow
      W<b>6</b> flowing through the right-side duct <b>74</b> can be increased relatively.
      As a consequence, a cooling sensation can be effectively imparted to the front-side
      vehicle occupant <b>28</b> sitting at the front seat <b>10</b>.<br />(63) Note
      that in the present exemplary embodiment, a structure is employed in which the
      cup holder <b>94</b> is used as the opening/closing device, and the inhibiting
      portion <b>108</b> having the circular hole <b>110</b> is provided at the cup
      holder <b>94</b>. However, it is also possible to employ a structure in which
      the inhibiting portion <b>108</b> is not provided at the opening/closing device,
      and an article is simply placed on top of the plate <b>96</b>. Moreover, it
      is also possible to employ a structure in which, for example, in the open state,
      the portion of the plate <b>96</b> located on the opposite side thereof from
      the portion that is joined to the backboard <b>68</b> is not supported on the
      backboard <b>68</b>, in other words, a structure in which, in the open state,
      it is not possible for an article to be placed on top of the plate <b>96</b>.<br
      />Second Exemplary Embodiment<br />(64) In a second exemplary embodiment shown
      in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the one end of the rear-side
      duct <b>90</b> is joined to the seat interior duct <b>58</b> on the other end
      side of the seat interior duct <b>58</b> from the join portion where the left-side
      duct <b>72</b> (not shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>)
      and the right-side duct <b>74</b> are joined to the seat interior duct <b>58</b>.<br
      />(65) In addition, the present exemplary embodiment is provided with a first
      damper device <b>120</b> which is serving as a restricting device. The first
      damper device <b>120</b> is provided with a first damper frame <b>122</b> that
      forms part of the flow path <b>51</b>. The first damper frame <b>122</b> is
      formed, for example, in a frame shape or a cylindrical shape whose opening faces
      in the vehicle up-down direction. The first damper frame <b>122</b> is provided
      between the join portion where the seat interior duct <b>58</b> is joined to
      the rear-side duct <b>90</b>, and the join portion where the seat interior duct
      <b>58</b> is joined to the left-side duct <b>72</b> and the right-side duct
      <b>74</b>. The airflow W<b>4</b> is able to pass through the first damper frame
      <b>122</b>.<br />(66) In addition, one or more (two in the present exemplary
      embodiment) first dampers <b>124</b> are provided at the first damper frame
      <b>122</b>. The first dampers <b>124</b> are formed in a plate shape that is
      elongated in the vehicle width direction, and portions located at both ends
      in a longitudinal direction of the respective first dampers <b>124</b>, each
      of the portions is located at a substantially central location in the width
      direction of the respective first dampers <b>124</b>, is supported at the first
      damper frame <b>122</b> so as to be able to rotate in directions around an axis
      (i.e., in the direction shown by an arrow G and a direction shown by an arrow
      H in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>), with the axial direction
      of this rotation extending in the vehicle width direction.<br />(67) A state
      in which the width direction of the first dampers <b>124</b> extends roughly
      in the vehicle up-down direction (i.e., the state shown by the solid lines in
      <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) is the open state (i.e.,
      is an unrestricted state) of the first damper device <b>120</b>. In this state,
      the airflow W<b>4</b> is able to pass through the first damper frame <b>122</b>.
      In contrast to this, a state in which the width direction of the first dampers
      <b>124</b> extends roughly in the vehicle front-rear direction (i.e., the state
      shown by the double-dot chain lines in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>)
      is the closed state (i.e., is a restricted state) of the first damper device
      <b>120</b>. In this state, the inside of the first damper frame <b>122</b> is
      closed off by the first dampers <b>124</b>. Because of this, passage of the
      airflow W<b>4</b> through the first damper frame <b>122</b> is inhibited.<br
      />(68) A rotation shaft of the first dampers <b>124</b> is mechanically connected
      to an output shaft of a first damper motor (not shown in the drawings), and
      the first dampers <b>124</b> are rotated by drive force from the first damper
      motor. The first damper motor is electrically connected to a control device
      (not shown in the drawings), and this control device is further electrically
      connected to a first load sensor (not shown in the drawings) that is provided
      in the front seat <b>10</b> which is serving as a front passenger''s seat.<br
      />(69) The first load sensor detects a load that is applied to the front seat
      <b>10</b>. When the first load sensor detects that a load has been applied when
      the front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b> sits at the front seat <b>10</b>,
      the first damper motor is driven by the control device such that the first damper
      device <b>120</b> is placed in the open state (i.e., in the unrestricted state).
      In contrast to this, when the front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b> is not sitting
      at the front seat <b>10</b>, the load that is applied when the front-side vehicle
      occupant <b>28</b> sits at the front seat <b>10</b> is not detected by the first
      load sensor. In this case, the first damper motor is driven by the control device
      such that the first damper device <b>120</b> is placed in the closed state (i.e.,
      in the restricted state).<br />(70) In addition, the present exemplary embodiment
      is also provided with a second damper device <b>126</b> which is serving as
      an opening-closing device. The second damper device <b>126</b> is provided with
      a second damper frame <b>128</b> that forms part of the flow path <b>51</b>.
      The second damper frame <b>128</b> is formed, for example, in a frame shape
      or a cylindrical shape whose opening faces in the vehicle front-rear direction.
      The second damper frame <b>128</b> is attached to an end portion on the vehicle
      rear side of the rear-side duct <b>90</b>, and the airflow W<b>8</b> is able
      to pass through the second damper frame <b>128</b>.<br />(71) In addition, one
      or more (two in the present exemplary embodiment) second dampers <b>130</b>
      are provided at the second damper frame <b>128</b>. The second dampers <b>130</b>
      are formed in a plate shape that is elongated in the vehicle width direction,
      and portions located at both ends in a longitudinal direction of the respective
      second dampers <b>130</b>, each of the portions is located at a substantially
      central location in the width direction of the respective second dampers <b>130</b>,
      are supported at the second damper frame <b>128</b> so as to be able to rotate
      in directions around an axis (i.e., in the direction shown by an arrow J and
      a direction shown by an arrow K in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>),
      with the axial direction of this rotation extending in the vehicle width direction.<br
      />(72) A state in which the width direction of the second dampers <b>130</b>
      extends roughly in the vehicle front-rear direction (i.e., the state shown by
      the solid lines in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) is the
      open state of the second damper device <b>126</b>. In this state, the airflow
      W<b>8</b> is able to pass through the second damper frame <b>128</b>. In contrast
      to this, a state in which the width direction of the second dampers <b>130</b>
      extends roughly in the vehicle up-down direction (i.e., the state shown by the
      double-dot chain lines in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>)
      is the closed state of the second damper device <b>126</b>. In this state, the
      inside of the second damper frame <b>128</b> is closed off by the second dampers
      <b>130</b>. Because of this, passage of the airflow W<b>8</b> through the second
      damper frame <b>128</b> is inhibited.<br />(73) A rotation shaft of the second
      dampers <b>130</b> is mechanically connected to an output shaft of a second
      damper motor (not shown in the drawings), and the second dampers <b>130</b>
      are rotated by drive force from the second damper motor. The second damper motor
      is electrically connected to a control device (not shown in the drawings), and
      this control device is further electrically connected to a second load sensor
      (not shown in the drawings) that is provided in the rear seat <b>36</b>.<br
      />(74) The second load sensor detects a load that is applied to the rear seat
      <b>36</b>. When the second load sensor detects that a load has been applied
      when the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b> sits at the rear seat <b>36</b>,
      the second damper motor is driven by the control device such that the second
      damper device <b>126</b> is placed in the open state. In contrast to this, when
      the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b> is not sitting at the rear seat <b>36</b>,
      the load that is applied when the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b> sits
      at the rear seat <b>36</b> is not detected by the second load sensor. In this
      case, the second damper motor is driven by the control device such that the
      second damper device <b>126</b> is placed in the closed state.<br />(75) Furthermore,
      the present exemplary embodiment is also provided with an airflow deflection
      device <b>132</b> which is serving as an opening-closing device. The airflow
      deflection device <b>132</b> is provided with a frame component <b>134</b> that
      forms part of the flow path <b>51</b>. The frame component <b>134</b> is formed,
      for example, in a frame shape or a cylindrical shape whose opening faces in
      the vehicle front-rear direction. An end portion on the vehicle front side of
      the frame component <b>134</b> is attached to an end portion on the vehicle
      rear side of the second damper frame <b>128</b> of the second damper device
      <b>126</b>, and the airflow W<b>8</b> that has passed through the second damper
      frame <b>128</b> is able to pass through the frame component <b>134</b>. In
      addition, an end portion on the vehicle rear side of the frame component <b>134</b>
      is inserted through the aperture <b>92</b> in the backboard <b>68</b> and is
      attached to the backboard <b>68</b>. Because of this, the airflow W<b>8</b>
      is blown out towards the vehicle rear side through the aperture <b>92</b> in
      the backboard <b>68</b> by passing through the frame component <b>134</b>.<br
      />(76) Plural first fins <b>136</b> which are serving as airflow deflection
      components are provided inside the frame component <b>134</b>. These first fins
      <b>136</b> are formed in a plate shape that is elongated in the vehicle width
      direction, and are arranged in a row at predetermined intervals from each other
      in the vehicle up-down direction. Portions located at both ends in the longitudinal
      direction of the respective first fins <b>136</b>, each of the portions is located
      at a substantially central portion in the width direction of the respective
      first fins <b>136</b>, are supported at the frame component <b>134</b> so as
      to be able to rotate in directions around an axis, with the axial direction
      of this rotation extending in the vehicle width direction.<br />(77) As a result
      of the first fins <b>136</b> being rotated, the angle of inclination in the
      vehicle up-down direction of the first fins <b>136</b> relative to the vehicle
      front-rear direction changes. As a result, when the airflow W<b>8</b> flows
      past the sides of the first fins <b>136</b>, the airflow W<b>8</b> flows along
      the width direction of the first fins <b>136</b> so that the direction of flow
      of the airflow W<b>8</b> changes in the vehicle up-down direction. Furthermore,
      when the first fins <b>136</b> have been rotated such that the width direction
      of the first fins <b>136</b> extends in the vehicle up-down direction, the gap
      between the first fins <b>136</b> that are mutually adjacent in the vehicle
      up-down direction is reduced to a minimum, and passage of the airflow W<b>8</b>
      past the sides of the first fins <b>136</b> is restricted.<br />(78) Plural
      second fins <b>138</b> (in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>,
      only one fin located substantially in the central portion in the vehicle width
      direction is shown), which are serving as airflow deflection components, are
      provided at the vehicle rear side of the first fins <b>136</b> inside the frame
      component <b>134</b>. These second fins <b>138</b> are formed in a plate shape
      that is elongated in the vehicle up-down direction, and are arranged in a row
      at predetermined intervals from each other in the vehicle width direction. Portions
      located at both ends in the longitudinal direction of the respective second
      fins <b>138</b>, each of the portions is located at a substantially central
      location in the width direction of the respective second fins <b>138</b>, are
      supported at the frame component <b>134</b> so as to be able to rotate in directions
      around an axis, with the axial direction of this rotation extending in the vehicle
      up-down direction.<br />(79) As a result of the second fins <b>138</b> being
      rotated, the angle of inclination in the vehicle width direction of the second
      fins <b>138</b> relative to the vehicle front-rear direction changes. As a result,
      when the airflow W<b>8</b> flows past the sides of the second fins <b>138</b>,
      the airflow W<b>8</b> flows along the width direction of the second fins <b>138</b>
      so that the direction of flow of the airflow W<b>8</b> change in the vehicle
      width direction. Furthermore, when the second fins <b>138</b> have been rotated
      such that the width direction of the second fins <b>138</b> extends in the vehicle
      width direction, the gap between the second fins <b>138</b> that are mutually
      adjacent in the vehicle width direction is reduced to a minimum, and passage
      of the airflow W<b>8</b> past the sides of the second fins <b>138</b> is restricted.<br
      />(80) Furthermore, the airflow deflection device <b>132</b> is also provided
      with an operating component (not shown in the drawings). The operating component
      is formed by a dial or lever or the like, and this is provided at an end portion
      at the vehicle rear side of the frame component <b>134</b>, or in a position
      at the backboard <b>68</b> where it can be operated by the rear-side vehicle
      occupant <b>38</b>. The operating component is mechanically connected to a rotation
      shaft of the first fins <b>136</b> and to a rotation shaft of the second fins
      <b>138</b>, and the first fins <b>136</b> and the second fins <b>138</b> are
      rotated as a result of this operating component being operated. As a consequence,
      the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b> is able to adjust the direction of
      flow of the airflow W<b>8</b>.<br />Action and Effects of the Second Exemplary
      Embodiment<br />(81) In the second exemplary embodiment having the structure
      described above, when the front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b> is not sitting
      at the front seat <b>10</b> (i.e., the front passenger''s seat), the load that
      is applied when the front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b> sits at the front
      seat <b>10</b> is not detected by the first load sensor. In this state, the
      first damper motor is driven by the control device such that the first damper
      device <b>120</b> is placed in the closed state (i.e., in the restricted state).
      As a result, the first dampers <b>124</b> are rotated such that the width direction
      of the first dampers <b>124</b> extends roughly in the vehicle front-rear direction.
      As a result, the interior of the first damper frame <b>122</b> is closed off
      by the first dampers <b>124</b>, and passage of the airflow W<b>4</b> through
      the damper frame <b>122</b> is either inhibited or prevented. As a result of
      the flow of the airflow W<b>4</b> towards the other end of the seat interior
      duct <b>58</b> being either inhibited or prevented in this way, the flow of
      the airflow W<b>5</b> inside the left-side duct <b>72</b>, and the flow of the
      airflow W<b>6</b> inside the right-side duct <b>74</b> are either inhibited
      or prevented.<br />(82) In this state, if the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b>
      sits at the rear seat <b>36</b>, and the second load sensor detects the load
      that is applied when the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b> is sitting at
      the rear seat <b>36</b>, then the second damper motor is driven by the control
      device such that the second damper device <b>126</b> is placed in the open state.
      As a result of this, the second dampers <b>130</b> are rotated such that the
      width direction of the second dampers <b>130</b> extends roughly in the vehicle
      front-rear direction. As a result, the interior of the second damper frame <b>128</b>
      is opened up, and the airflow W<b>8</b> is able to pass through the second damper
      frame <b>128</b>.<br />(83) Here, in this state, the flow of the airflow W<b>4</b>
      towards the other end of the seat interior duct <b>58</b> is inhibited, and
      the flow of the airflow W<b>5</b> inside the left-side duct <b>72</b> and also
      the flow of the airflow W<b>6</b> inside the right-side duct <b>74</b> are either
      inhibited or blocked. Because of this, the airflow W<b>4</b> flowing from the
      seat interior duct <b>58</b> towards the rear-side duct <b>90</b>, in other
      words, the airflow W<b>8</b> flowing through the rear-side duct <b>90</b> is
      increased relatively. As a result, the airflow W<b>8</b> blown from the vehicle
      rear-side end portion (i.e., the seat rear-side end portion) of the frame component
      <b>134</b> of the airflow deflection device <b>132</b> towards the vehicle rear
      side, can be increased, and a cooling sensation can be imparted effectively
      to the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b> sitting at the rear seat <b>36</b>.<br
      />(84) Furthermore, if, in this state, the operating component of the airflow
      deflection device <b>132</b> is operated by the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b>
      so that the first fins <b>136</b> are rotated such that the width direction
      of the first fins <b>136</b> extends in the vehicle up-down direction, or if
      the second fins <b>138</b> are rotated such that the width direction of the
      second fins <b>138</b> extends in the vehicle width direction, then the passage
      of the airflow W<b>8</b> through the frame component <b>134</b> is either inhibited
      or prevented. As a result, the discharge of the airflow W<b>8</b> from the end
      portion on the vehicle rear side of the frame component <b>134</b> towards the
      vehicle rear side can be either inhibited or prevented. As a result, the airflow
      W<b>8</b> can be inhibited from being blown towards the rear-side vehicle occupant
      <b>38</b>.<br />(85) In contrast, when, for example, the rear-side vehicle occupant
      <b>38</b> is not sitting at the rear seat <b>36</b>, the load that is applied
      when the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b> sits at the rear seat <b>36</b>
      is not detected by the second load sensor. In this state, the second damper
      motor is driven by the control device such that the second damper device <b>126</b>
      is placed in the closed state. As a result, the second dampers <b>130</b> are
      rotated such that the width direction of the second dampers <b>130</b> extends
      roughly in the vehicle up-down direction. The interior of the second damper
      frame <b>128</b> is closed off by the second dampers <b>130</b>. As a consequence,
      passage of the airflow W<b>8</b> through the second damper frame <b>128</b>
      is either inhibited or prevented and, furthermore, the flow of the airflow W<b>4</b>
      from the seat interior duct <b>58</b> towards the rear-side duct <b>90</b> is
      also inhibited or prevented.<br />(86) In this state, if the front-side vehicle
      occupant <b>28</b> sits at the front seat <b>10</b>, and the first load sensor
      detects the load that is applied when the front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b>
      is sitting at the front seat <b>10</b>, then the first damper motor is driven
      by the control device such that the first damper device <b>120</b> is placed
      in the open state (i.e. in the unrestricted state). As a result of this, the
      first dampers <b>124</b> are rotated such that the width direction of the first
      dampers <b>124</b> extends roughly in the vehicle up-down direction. The interior
      of the first damper frame <b>122</b> is opened up, and the airflow W<b>4</b>
      is able to pass through the first damper frame <b>122</b>.<br />(87) Here, in
      this state, the flow of the airflow W<b>4</b> from the seat interior duct <b>58</b>
      towards the rear-side duct <b>90</b> is inhibited. Because of this, the airflow
      W<b>4</b> flowing towards the other end of the seat interior duct <b>58</b>,
      in other words, the airflow W<b>5</b> flowing through the left-side duct <b>72</b>
      and also the airflow W<b>6</b> flowing though the right-side duct <b>74</b>
      increase relatively. As a consequence, the airflow W<b>5</b> blown out from
      the left-side blower portion <b>80</b>, and the airflow W<b>6</b> blown out
      from the right-side blower portion <b>82</b> can be increased. As a result of
      the increased airflows W<b>5</b> and W<b>6</b> merging into a flow with the
      airflow W<b>7</b> in this way, a cooling sensation can be effectively imparted
      to the front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b> sitting in the front seat <b>10</b>.<br
      />(88) Note that in the present exemplary embodiment, the drive device of the
      first damper device <b>120</b> that is used to rotate the first dampers <b>124</b>
      is the first damper motor, and the drive device of the second damper device
      <b>126</b> that is used to rotate the second dampers <b>130</b> is the second
      damper motor. However, it is also possible for these drive devices to be formed
      by solenoids in which a magnetic plunger is moved when supplied with electric
      power. In other words, provided that the drive device has a structure in which
      the first dampers <b>124</b> or the second dampers <b>130</b> can be rotated
      by drive force output from the drive device, then an optional type of drive
      device can be employed and the specific type thereof is not particularly restricted.
      In other words, it is also possible to employ a structure in which instead of
      using drive devices such as those described above, a damper operating component
      is provided at a position where it can be operated by the front-side vehicle
      occupant <b>28</b> or the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b>, and the first
      damper <b>124</b> or the second damper <b>130</b> are rotated as a result of
      the damper operating component being operated manually.<br />(89) Moreover,
      in the present exemplary embodiment, a structure is employed in which the first
      damper device <b>120</b> which is serving as a restricting device, and the second
      damper device <b>126</b> which is serving as an opening/closing device are both
      provided, however, it is also possible to employ a structure in which only one
      of the restricting device and the opening/closing device is provided.<br />(90)
      Furthermore, in the present exemplary embodiment, a structure that is provided
      with the airflow deflection device <b>132</b> is employed, however, it is also
      possible to employ a structure in which the airflow deflection device <b>132</b>
      is not provided. Additionally, this type of airflow deflection device <b>132</b>
      may also be used in the above-described first exemplary embodiment.<br />(91)
      Moreover, in each of the above-described embodiments, a structure is employed
      in which the rear face duct <b>30</b> is provided, and the airflow W<b>2</b>
      is blown towards the upper body portion of the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b>
      from the rear face blower portion <b>34</b> provided at the vehicle rear-side
      end portion of the center console <b>32</b>. However, it is also possible to
      employ a structure in which the rear face duct <b>30</b> is not provided, and
      only the airflow W<b>8</b> that is blown from the rear-side duct <b>90</b> towards
      the vehicle rear side is blown towards the upper body portion of the rear-side
      vehicle occupant <b>38</b>.<br />(92) Furthermore, the seat ventilation system
      <b>50</b> of the above-described respective exemplary embodiments is formed
      such that the airflows W<b>1</b>, W<b>5</b>, and W<b>6</b>, which are airflows
      of cool air, are merged with an airflow generated as a result of the seat cushion
      fan <b>84</b> being operated and with the airflow W<b>7</b> generated as a result
      of the seat back fan <b>86</b> being operated, and this is used to supply cool
      air to the vicinity of the body of the front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b>.
      However, it is also possible to employ a structure in which the airflow W<b>4</b>,
      which is an airflow of cool air, is discharged towards the body of the front-side
      vehicle occupant <b>28</b> from the seat cushion <b>60</b> and the seat back
      <b>62</b> of the front seat <b>10</b>.<br />(93) Moreover, in the above-described
      respective embodiments, a structure provided with the seat ventilation system
      <b>50</b> is employed. However, it is also possible to employ a structure in
      which the left-side duct <b>72</b> and the right-side duct <b>74</b> are not
      provided, and the entire airflow W<b>4</b> flowing through the seat interior
      duct <b>58</b> is supplied to the rear-side duct <b>90</b>, and is blown out
      as the airflow W<b>8</b> (namely, as cool air) towards the vehicle rear side
      of the front seat <b>10</b>.<br />(94) Furthermore, in the above-described respective
      embodiments, a structure is described in which the present disclosure is applied
      to the front seat <b>10</b> of the vehicle <b>12</b>. However, it is also possible,
      for example, in a vehicle <b>12</b> in which three or more rows of seats are
      provided in the vehicle front-rear direction of the vehicle <b>12</b>, for the
      present disclosure to be applied to the second and subsequent rows of seats
      from the vehicle front side. In other words, provided that the seat is mounted
      in the vehicle <b>12</b>, then the present disclosure is not limited to the
      front seat <b>10</b> and can be broadly applied.<br />(95) In addition, in the
      above-described respective exemplary embodiments, the respective directions
      that are based on the vehicle <b>12</b>, namely, the vehicle front-rear direction,
      the vehicle up-down direction, and the vehicle width direction, and the like
      are the same as the respective directions based on the front seat <b>10</b>,
      namely, the seat front-rear direction, the seat up-down direction, and the seat
      width direction. However, the present disclosure may also be applied to a vehicle
      <b>12</b> in which the respective directions based on the vehicle <b>12</b>
      and the respective directions based on the front seat <b>10</b> are not the
      same.<br />(96) Exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure have been described
      above, however, the present disclosure is not limited to this. Various modifications
      and the like may be made to the present disclosure insofar as they do not depart
      from the scope of the present disclosure.","claimsHtml":"1. A vehicle seat comprising:

      Field<br />(1) The present disclosure relates to a vehicle seat that is mounted
      in a vehicle.<br />Related Art<br />(2) A vehicle disclosed, for example, in
      Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No. 2011-194908 is provided with
      a seat air-conditioning duct. One end of the seat air-conditioning duct is connected
      to an air-conditioning device, while another end of the seat air-conditioning
      duct is disposed inside a front seat. Conditioned air (for example, cool air)
      produced by the air-conditioning device flows through the seat air-conditioning
      duct and is subsequently blown out from the other end of the air-conditioning
      duct onto a seating surface side of a seat cushion of the front seat and a seat
      front surface side of a seat back of this front seat.<br />(3) A structure may
      also be considered in which one end of a rear air-conditioning duct, which is
      a different duct from the seat air-conditioning duct, is connected to the air-conditioning
      device, and another end of this rear air-conditioning duct opens, for example,
      at a vehicle rear-side surface of a center console of the vehicle so as to blow
      conditioned air towards the rear seat side.<br />(4) If the rear seat is formed
      by what is known as a bench seat, then vehicle occupant seating positions are
      set at both end sides in the vehicle width direction of the rear seat, in other
      words, at the vehicle rear side of a driver''s seat and at the vehicle rear
      side of a front passenger''s seat on the rear seat, and also in a central portion
      in the vehicle width direction on the rear seat.<br />(5) Generally, when vehicle
      occupants are sitting in the rear seat, the seating positions on both end sides
      in the vehicle width direction of the rear seat are used, while if, for example,
      three vehicle occupants are sitting in the rear seat, then the seating position
      in the central portion in the vehicle width direction is also used. In other
      words, generally, it is more common for the seating positions on both end sides
      in the vehicle width direction of the rear seat to be used than the seating
      position in the central portion in the vehicle width direction.<br />(6) Here,
      the seating positions on the end sides in the vehicle width direction of the
      rear seat are located diagonally on the vehicle rear-left side and diagonally
      on the vehicle rear-right side looking from the vehicle rear-side surface of
      the center console, and are somewhat distant from the vehicle rear-side surface
      of the center console. Because of this, it is difficult to ensure that the conditioned
      air blown out from the duct aperture located at the vehicle rear-side surface
      of the center console is supplied efficiently to vehicle occupants sitting in
      the positions on the two end sides in the vehicle width direction of the rear
      seat.<br />SUMMARY<br />(7) The present disclosure was conceived in view of
      the above-described circumstances and provides a vehicle seat that enables conditioned
      air to be supplied efficiently to vehicle occupants sitting in the sitting positions
      on the end sides in the vehicle width direction of the rear seat.<br />(8) A
      vehicle seat of a first aspect of the present disclosure includes a seat main
      body that has a seat back, and the seat main body is disposed at a vehicle front
      side of a seating position at an end side in a vehicle width direction of a
      rear seat; and a flow path having one end side and another end side, conditioned
      air flows through the one end side, the conditioned air is produced by an air-conditioning
      device mounted at the vehicle, the other end side is disposed inside the seat
      main body, another end of the flow path opens at a vehicle rear surface of the
      seat back, and the conditioned air flows through the inside of the flow path
      and is blown from the other end towards a vehicle rear side of the seat back.<br
      />(9) In the vehicle seat of the first aspect, conditioned air produced by an
      air-conditioning device flows through a flow path from one end side of that
      flow path. Another end of the flow path opens at a vehicle rear surface of a
      seat back of the seat main body, and conditioned air that flows through the
      flow path is blown from the other end towards the vehicle rear side of the seat
      back. Here, the seat main body is disposed at a vehicle front side of a seating
      position at an end side in the vehicle width direction of the rear seat. Because
      of this, compared with a structure in which the other end side of the flow path
      is situated closer to a central portion in the vehicle width direction than
      the seat main body, a distance between the other end side of the flow path and
      a vehicle occupant who is sitting at a sitting position of an end side in the
      vehicle width direction of the rear seat can be shortened. Accordingly, conditioned
      air can be supplied efficiently to vehicle occupants who are sitting at sitting
      positions of the two end sides in the vehicle width direction of the rear seat.<br
      />(10) A vehicle seat of a second aspect of the present disclosure is characterized
      in that, in the vehicle seat of the first aspect, there is provided an opening/closing
      device that is provided at the flow path or at the seat back so as to be able
      to open and close the flow path, and that, when in an open state, allows the
      conditioned air to be blown towards the vehicle rear side of the seat back,
      and when in a closed state, closes off the flow path so as to inhibit or prevent
      the conditioned air from being blown towards the vehicle rear side of the seat
      back.<br />(11) According to the vehicle seat of the second aspect, an opening/closing
      device is provided at the flow path or in the seat back. This opening/closing
      device is able to open and close the flow path, and when the opening/closing
      device is in an open state, it allows the conditioned air flowing through the
      flow path to be blown towards the vehicle rear side of the seat back. In contrast,
      when the opening/closing device is in a closed state, the flow path is closed
      off by the opening/closing device. As a consequence, the discharge of conditioned
      air towards the vehicle rear side of the seat back is either inhibited or prevented.<br
      />(12) A vehicle seat of a third aspect of the present disclosure is characterized
      in that, in the vehicle seat of the second aspect, the opening/closing device
      is provided with a placement portion that is provided at the seat back, and
      when the opening/closing device is in the closed state, the placement portion
      closes off the other end of the flow path, while when the opening/closing device
      is in the open state, the placement portion extends towards the vehicle rear
      side from the seat back, and an article is able to be placed on the placement
      portion at the vehicle rear side of the other end of the flow path.<br />(13)
      According to the vehicle seat of the third aspect, the opening/closing device
      is provided with a placement portion that is provided at the seat back. When
      the opening/closing device is in a closed state, the other end of the flow path
      is closed off by the placement portion. In contrast, when the opening/closing
      device is in an open state, the placement portion extends towards the vehicle
      rear side from the seat back. In this state, an article can be placed on the
      placement portion. Moreover, the article that is placed on the placement portion
      is disposed on the seat rear side of the other end of the flow path. Because
      of this, conditioned air can be blown against the article on the placement portion.<br
      />(14) The vehicle seat of the fourth aspect of the present disclosure is characterized
      in that, in the vehicle seat of the third aspect, the opening/closing device
      is provided with an inhibiting portion that is able to contact the article placed
      on the placement portion from a vehicle front-rear direction side and from a
      vehicle width direction side thereof, and the inhibiting portion, by contacting
      the article, is able to inhibit movement of the article in the vehicle front-rear
      direction and in the vehicle width direction.<br />(15) According to the vehicle
      seat of the fourth aspect, the opening/closing device is provided with an inhibiting
      portion. The inhibiting portion is able to contact an article placed on the
      placement portion from a vehicle front-rear direction side and from a vehicle
      width direction side thereof, and movement of the article in the seat front-rear
      directions and in the seat width directions is inhibited by the inhibiting portion
      coming into contact the article. As a result, the attitude of the article can
      be kept stable on top of the placement portion.<br />(16) The vehicle seat of
      the fifth aspect of the present disclosure is characterized in that, in the
      vehicle seat of any one of the first through fourth aspects, the other end of
      the flow path is disposed further toward a vehicle upper side than a vehicle
      rear-side end portion of a center console that is provided closer to a central
      portion in the vehicle width direction than the seat main body.<br />(17) According
      to the vehicle seat of the fifth aspect, the other end of the flow path is disposed
      at further toward a vehicle upper side than a vehicle rear-side end portion
      of a center console that is provided closer to a central portion in the vehicle
      width direction than the seat main body. Because of this, conditioned air can
      be effectively blown towards an upper body of a vehicle occupant who is sitting
      at a sitting position on an end portion side in the vehicle width direction
      of a rear seat.<br />(18) A vehicle seat of a sixth aspect of the present disclosure
      is characterized in that, in the vehicle seat of any one of the first through
      fifth aspects, a branch is formed at the flow path between the one end and the
      other end thereof so that the flow path is able to extend to both sides in the
      vehicle width direction of the seat back and opens at both sides of the seat
      back, and the conditioned air can be discharged through openings at both sides
      towards a vehicle front side of the seat back.<br />(19) According to the vehicle
      seat of the sixth aspect, the flow path is able to discharge conditioned air
      towards the vehicle front side of the seat back. Because of this, conditioned
      air can be supplied effectively to the body of a vehicle occupant sitting at
      the seat main body or to the vicinity of the occupant body.<br />(20) The vehicle
      seat of the seventh embodiment of the present disclosure is characterized in
      that, in the vehicle seat of any one of the first through sixth aspects, the
      vehicle seat further includes a restricting device that is provided at the flow
      path, and the restricting device is able to switch between an unrestricted state
      in which the conditioned air is capable of being blown towards the vehicle front
      side of the seat back, and a restricted state in which the blowing of the conditioned
      air towards the vehicle front side of the seat back is restricted.<br />(21)
      According to the vehicle seat of the seventh aspect, a restricting device is
      provided at the flow path, and the restricting device is able to switch between
      an unrestricted state and a restricted state. When the restricting device is
      in the unrestricted state, conditioned air can be blown towards the vehicle
      front side of the seat back. In contrast to this, when the restricting device
      is in the restricted state, the discharge of conditioned air towards the seat
      front side of the seat back is restricted. As a result, it is possible to increase
      the quantity of conditioned air discharged towards the seat rear side by reducing
      or eliminating the quantity of conditioned air discharged towards the vehicle
      front side of the seat back.<br />(22) As has been described above, the vehicle
      seat of the first aspect enables conditioned air to be supplied efficiently
      to a vehicle occupant sitting at a sitting position on an end side in the vehicle
      width direction of a rear seat.<br />(23) The vehicle seat of the second aspect
      enables conditioned air to be discharged towards a vehicle occupant sitting
      at a rear seat when an opening/closing device is in an open state, and enables
      the discharge of conditioned air towards the seat rear side of a seat back to
      be inhibited when the opening/closing device is in a closed state.<br />(24)
      The vehicle seat of the third aspect enables conditioned air to be blown against
      an article placed on a placement portion of the opening/closing device.<br />(25)
      The vehicle seat of the fourth aspect enables the attitude of an article to
      be kept stable.<br />(26) The vehicle seat of the fifth aspect enables conditioned
      air to be supplied effectively to an upper body of a vehicle occupant sitting
      at a rear seat.<br />(27) The vehicle seat of the sixth aspect enables conditioned
      air to be supplied effectively to the body of a vehicle occupant sitting at
      the seat main body or to the vicinity of the occupant body.<br />(28) The vehicle
      seat of the seventh aspect enables the quantity of conditioned air discharged
      towards the seat rear side to be increased.","backgroundTextHtml":"CROSS-REFERENCE
