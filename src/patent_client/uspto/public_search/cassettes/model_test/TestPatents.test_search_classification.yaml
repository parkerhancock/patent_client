        main body that forms an air-conditioning device. The HVAC unit <b>14</b> is
        disposed at a vehicle front-lower side of an instrument panel <b>16</b> of
        the vehicle <b>12</b>. The HVAC unit <b>14</b> is provided with a main fan
        <b>18</b>, and an airflow W is generated as a result of the main fan <b>18</b>
        being operated. An evaporator <b>20</b> and a heater core <b>22</b> and the
        like are provided on a downstream side of the airflow W (i.e., on the vehicle
        rear side in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) from the main
        fan <b>18</b>, so that the airflow W forms conditioned air whose temperature
        and humidity and the like have been conditioned.<br />(10) One end of a front
        face duct <b>24</b> is connected to the HVAC unit <b>14</b>. Another end of
        the front face duct <b>24</b> is connected to a front face blower portion
        <b>26</b>. The front face blower portion <b>26</b> is provided at a vehicle
        rear-side portion of the instrument panel <b>16</b>, and the airflow W flowing
        from the HVAC unit <b>14</b> towards the front face duct <b>24</b> is blown
        as an airflow W<b>1</b>, which is serving as conditioned air, towards the
        vehicle rear side from the front face blower portion <b>26</b>. As a result,
        the airflow W<b>1</b> flows towards an upper body of a front-side vehicle
        occupant <b>28</b> (for example, towards the vicinity of a facial area of
        the front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b>) who is sitting at the front seat
        <b>10</b>.<br />(11) In addition, one end of a rear face duct <b>30</b> is
        connected to the HVAC unit <b>14</b>. Another end side of the duct <b>30</b>
        is disposed at the vehicle lower side of a center console <b>32</b>. The center
        console <b>32</b> is provided between one front seat <b>10</b> which is serving
        as a driver''s seat, and another front seat <b>10</b> which is serving as
        a front passenger''s seat, and the other end side of the rear face duct <b>30</b>
        extends towards the vehicle rear side at the vehicle lower side of the center
        console <b>32</b>.<br />(12) The other end of the rear face duct <b>30</b>
        is connected to a rear face blower portion <b>34</b>. The rear face blower
        portion <b>34</b> is disposed at an upper-side portion of a vehicle rear-side
        end portion of the center console <b>32</b>. The airflow W (for example, cool
        air) flowing from the HVAC unit <b>14</b> towards the rear face duct <b>30</b>
        is blown as an airflow W<b>2</b> from the rear face blower portion <b>34</b>
        towards the vehicle upper rear side. As a result, the airflow W<b>2</b> flows
        towards an upper body of a rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b> who is sitting
        at the rear seat <b>36</b>.<br />(13) One end of a rear foot duct <b>40</b>
        is connected to the HVAC unit <b>14</b>. Another end of the rear foot duct
        <b>40</b> is connected to a rear foot blower portion <b>42</b>. The rear foot
        blower portion <b>42</b> is provided, for example, at the vehicle lower side
        of a vehicle rear-side end portion of the front seat <b>10</b>. The airflow
        W (for example, warm air) flowing from the HVAC unit <b>14</b> towards the
        rear foot duct <b>40</b> is blown as an airflow W<b>3</b> from the rear foot
        blower portion <b>42</b> towards the vehicle rear side. As a result, the airflow
        W<b>3</b> flows towards the feet of the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b>.<br
        />(14) A switching module <b>44</b>, which is serving as a switching device,
        is provided at the respective one end sides of the above-described rear face
        duct <b>30</b> and rear foot duct <b>40</b>. The switching module <b>44</b>
        is provided, for example, with a damper. The damper is mechanically connected,
        for example, to a damper motor via a deceleration mechanism (neither of these
        are shown in the drawings), and the damper is moved reciprocatingly by drive
        force from the damper motor.<br />(15) As a result of the damper being moved
        to one side of a range of this reciprocating motion, the switching module
        <b>44</b> is placed in a first state. In this first state, either all of or
        a large majority of the one end of the rear face duct <b>30</b> is closed
        off by the damper, while the one end of the rear foot duct <b>40</b> is opened
        up. As a result, either all of or a large majority of the airflow W (for example,
        warm air) produced by the HVAC unit <b>14</b> and flowing to the vicinity
        of the one end of the rear foot duct <b>40</b> and the one end of the rear
        face duct <b>30</b> flows to the rear foot duct <b>40</b>.<br />(16) In contrast
        to the first state of the damper, in a second state of the damper, the one
        ends of both the rear face duct <b>30</b> and the rear foot duct <b>40</b>
        are partially opened by the damper. As a result, the airflow W (for example,
        cool air) produced by the HVAC unit <b>14</b> and flowing to the vicinity
        of the one end of the rear face duct <b>30</b> and the one end of the rear
        foot duct <b>40</b> is split so as to flow to both the rear face duct <b>30</b>
        and the rear foot duct <b>40</b>.<br />(17) The vehicle <b>12</b> is also
        provided with a seat ventilation system <b>50</b>. The seat ventilation system
        <b>50</b> is provided with a branch duct <b>52</b>. One end of the branch
        duct <b>52</b> is connected to roughly an intermediate portion of the rear
        foot duct <b>40</b> at the vehicle lower side of the front seat <b>10</b>.<br
        />(18) Another end of the branch duct <b>52</b> is connected to a seat lower-side
        fan <b>54</b> which is serving as a blower device. When operated, the seat
        lower-side fan <b>54</b> suctions air on a branch duct <b>52</b> side. Because
        of this, when the seat lower-side fan <b>54</b> is operated, at least a portion
        of the airflow W flowing through the rear foot duct <b>40</b> flows into the
        branch duct <b>52</b> as an airflow W<b>4</b> so that the flow of the airflow
        W towards the rear foot blower portion <b>42</b> side is either prevented
        or inhibited. Additionally, one end of a seat-side duct <b>56</b> is connected
        to the seat lower-side fan <b>54</b>. Air suctioned by the seat lower-side
        fan <b>54</b>, namely, the airflow W<b>4</b> is supplied to the seat-side
        duct <b>56</b> and flows through the seat-side duct <b>56</b><br />(19) Another
        end of the seat-side duct <b>56</b> is connected to one end of a seat interior
        duct <b>58</b> that forms part of a flow path <b>51</b>. The seat interior
        duct <b>58</b> is provided at an inner side of a seat cushion <b>60</b> that
        forms part of a seat main body of the front seat <b>10</b> and at an inner
        side of a seat back <b>62</b> that forms part of the seat main body of the
        front seat <b>10</b>. One end of the seat interior duct <b>58</b> opens onto
        a vehicle lower side end of the seat cushion <b>60</b>. Here, the seat-side
        duct <b>56</b> is formed, for example, in a bellows shape. Because of this,
        it is possible for the seat-side duct <b>56</b> to be deformed in such a way
        that the other end-side portion of the seat-side duct <b>56</b> moves in the
        vehicle front-rear direction and in the vehicle up-down direction relative
        to the one end-side portion of the seat-side duct <b>56</b>. As a consequence
        of this, without the position of the one end of the seat-side duct <b>56</b>
        being changed, the other end of the seat-side duct <b>56</b> is able to follow
        movement of the front seat <b>10</b> in the vehicle front-rear direction and
        in the vehicle up-down direction.<br />(20) As is shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG.
        <b>4</b></figref>, another end side of the seat interior duct <b>58</b> is
        disposed between a pad central portion <b>66</b> of a seat pad <b>64</b>,
        that forms part of the seat back <b>62</b> of the front seat <b>10</b>, and
        a back plate portion <b>70</b> of a backboard <b>68</b>. The other end portion
        of the seat interior duct <b>58</b> is connected to one end of a left-side
        duct <b>72</b>, that forms part of the flow path <b>51</b>, and a right-side
        duct <b>74</b>, that also forms part of the flow path <b>51</b>.<br />(21)
        Another end side of the left-side duct <b>72</b> extends towards the left
        side in the vehicle width direction, and the other end portion of the left-side
        duct <b>72</b> is disposed between a pad side portion <b>76</b> of the seat
        pad <b>64</b> and a side plate portion <b>78</b> of the backboard <b>68</b>
        at the left side in the vehicle width direction. A portion of the airflow
        W<b>4</b> passing through the seat interior duct <b>58</b> can be made to
        flow through an inside of the left-side duct <b>72</b> as an airflow W<b>5</b>
        and blown out towards the vehicle front side from the other end of the left-side
        duct <b>72</b>.<br />(22) A portion between a vehicle front-side end of the
        side plate portion <b>78</b> of the backboard <b>68</b> and the pad side portion
        <b>76</b> of the seat pad <b>64</b> forms a left-side blower portion <b>80</b>
        which is serving as a blower portion at the left side in the vehicle width
        direction. The airflow W<b>5</b> that is blown out from the other end of the
        left-side duct <b>72</b> is blown from the left-side blower portion <b>80</b>
        towards the vehicle front side, and flows towards the vehicle front side along
        a surface on the left side in the vehicle width direction of the pad side
        portion <b>76</b>.<br />(23) In contrast to this, another end side of the
        right-side duct <b>74</b> extends towards the right side in the vehicle width
        direction, and the other end portion of the right-side duct <b>74</b> is disposed
        between the pad side portion <b>76</b> of the seat pad <b>64</b> and the side
        plate portion <b>78</b> of the backboard <b>68</b> at the right side in the
        vehicle width direction. A portion of the airflow W<b>4</b> passing through
        the seat interior duct <b>58</b> can be made to flow through an inside of
        the right-side duct <b>74</b> as an airflow W<b>6</b> and blown out towards
        the vehicle front side from the other end of the right-side duct <b>74</b>.<br
        />(24) A portion between a vehicle front-side end of the side plate portion
        <b>78</b> of the backboard <b>68</b> and the pad side portion <b>76</b> of
        the seat pad <b>64</b> forms a right-side blower portion <b>82</b> which is
        serving as a blower portion at the right side in the vehicle width direction.
        The airflow W<b>6</b> that is blown out from the other end of the right-side
        duct <b>74</b> is blown from the right-side blower portion <b>82</b> towards
        the vehicle front side, and flows towards the vehicle front side along a surface
        on the right side in the vehicle width direction of the pad side portion <b>76</b>.<br
        />(25) In addition, as is shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>,
        the seat ventilation system <b>50</b> is provided with a seat cushion fan
        <b>84</b>, which is serving as an intake device, and a seat back fan <b>86</b>
        which is also serving as an intake device. The seat cushion fan <b>84</b>
        is provided inside the seat cushion <b>60</b> of the front seat <b>10</b>.
        When operated, the seat cushion fan <b>84</b> attempts to take in air from
        the vehicle upper side (i.e., the seat upper side) of the seat cushion fan
        <b>84</b>. Here, the upholstery covering of the seat cushion <b>60</b> is
        formed from a breathable fabric. Alternatively, if the upholstery covering
        of the seat cushion <b>60</b> is formed from a barely breathable material
        such as leather or the like, then a number of micro holes are formed penetrating
        the upholstery covering in the thickness direction thereof.<br />(26) Because
        of this, when the seat cushion fan <b>84</b> is operated, and air at the vehicle
        upper side of the seat cushion fan <b>84</b> is taken in by the seat cushion
        fan <b>84</b>, an airflow (not shown in the drawings) is generated flowing
        from the vehicle upper side of the seat cushion <b>60</b> through the upholstery
        covering and cushion material of the seat cushion <b>60</b> towards the vehicle
        lower side. Accordingly, if the seat cushion fan <b>84</b> is operated while,
        for example, the front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b> is sitting at the front
        seat <b>10</b>, then an airflow (not shown in the drawings) is generated passing
        from the vehicle front-upper side, the vehicle left-upper side, and the vehicle
        right-upper side and the like of the seat cushion <b>60</b> over the thigh
        and buttock portions of the front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b>.<br />(27)
        A portion of the airflow W<b>1</b> blown from the front face blower portion
        <b>26</b> towards the vehicle rear side merges with the airflow generated
        by the operation of the seat cushion fan <b>84</b>. As a consequence, a portion
        of the airflow W<b>1</b> flows onto the thigh and buttock portions of the
        front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b>. As a result, if the airflow W<b>1</b>
        is cool air, then a cooling sensation can be effectively imparted to the thigh
        and buttock portions of the front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b>.<br />(28)
        In contrast to this, the seat back fan <b>86</b> is provided inside the seat
        back <b>62</b> of the front seat <b>10</b>. When operated, the seat back fan
        <b>86</b> attempts to take in air from the vehicle front side of the seat
        back fan <b>86</b>. Here, the upholstery covering of the seat back <b>62</b>
        is formed from a breathable fabric. Alternatively, if the upholstery covering
        of the seat back <b>62</b> is formed from a barely breathable material such
        as leather or the like, then a number of micro holes are formed penetrating
        the upholstery covering in the thickness direction thereof.<br />(29) Because
        of this, when the seat back fan <b>86</b> is operated, and air at the vehicle
        front side of the seat back fan <b>86</b> is taken in by the seat back fan
        <b>86</b>, an airflow is generated flowing from the vehicle upper side of
        the seat cushion <b>60</b> through the upholstery covering and cushion material
        of the seat back <b>62</b> towards the vehicle lower side. Accordingly, as
        is shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, if the seat
        back fan <b>86</b> is operated while, for example, the front-side vehicle
        occupant <b>28</b> is sitting in the front seat <b>10</b>, then an airflow
        W<b>7</b> is generated passing from the vehicle front-left side and the vehicle
        front-right side and the like of the seat back <b>62</b> over both sides in
        the vehicle width direction of the body of the front-side vehicle occupant
        <b>28</b>.<br />(30) At least a portion of each of the airflow W<b>1</b> blown
        from the front face blower portion <b>26</b> toward the vehicle rear side,
        and the respective airflows W<b>5</b> and W<b>6</b> flowing towards the vehicle
        front side along both side surfaces in the vehicle width direction of the
        pad side portion <b>76</b> merges with the airflow W<b>7</b> generated by
        the operation of the seat back fan <b>86</b>. As a consequence, at least a
        portion of each of the airflows W<b>1</b>, W<b>5</b>, and W<b>6</b> flows
        onto the thigh and buttock portions of the front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b>.
        As a result, if the airflows W<b>1</b>, W<b>5</b>, and W<b>6</b> are cool
        air, then a cooling sensation can be effectively imparted to both side portions
        in the vehicle width direction and the like of the body of the front-side
        vehicle occupant <b>28</b>.<br />(31) On the other hand, as is shown in <figref
        idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG.
        <b>4</b></figref>, a rear-side duct <b>90</b> that forms part of the flow
        path <b>51</b> is provided in the vicinity of the other end portion of the
        seat interior duct <b>58</b>. As is shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG.
        <b>1</b></figref>, one end of the rear-side duct <b>90</b> is connected from
        the vehicle rear side to the seat interior duct <b>58</b> at a location where
        the one end portions of each of the left-side duct <b>72</b> and the right-side
        duct <b>74</b> are connected to the other end portion of the seat interior
        duct <b>58</b>. Because of this, a portion of the airflow W<b>4</b> passing
        through the seat interior duct <b>58</b> can be made to flow through an inside
        of the rear-side duct <b>90</b> as an airflow W<b>8</b> which is serving as
        conditioned air.<br />(32) Another end of the rear-side duct <b>90</b> is
        open, and is connected to the backboard <b>68</b> from the vehicle front side.
        An aperture <b>92</b> that corresponds to the other end of the rear-side duct
        <b>90</b> is formed at the backboard <b>68</b>. The aperture <b>92</b> is
        formed, for example, in a substantially rectangular shape that is elongated
        in the vehicle width direction, and is disposed further towards a vehicle
        upper side from the upper-side end of the vehicle rear-side end portion of
        the center console <b>32</b> (namely, at the vehicle upper side of the rear
        face blower portion <b>34</b> provided in the center console <b>32</b>). The
        airflow W<b>8</b> flowing through the inside of the rear-side duct <b>90</b>
        is blown towards the vehicle rear side of the seat back <b>62</b> by passing
        through the other end of the rear-side duct <b>90</b> and the aperture <b>92</b>.<br
        />(33) Furthermore, a cup holder <b>94</b>, which is serving as an opening/closing
        device, is provided at the backboard <b>68</b>. The cup holder <b>94</b> is
        provided with a plate <b>96</b> which is serving as a placement portion. The
        plate <b>96</b> is formed in a substantially rectangular, flat plate shape
        that is elongated in the vehicle width direction. A pair of side plates <b>98</b>
        are provided at both sides in the vehicle width direction, and on one side
        in the thickness direction of the plate <b>96</b>. These side plates <b>98</b>
        are formed in a planar shape, and the thickness direction of the respective
        side plates <b>98</b> is set along the longitudinal direction of the plate
        <b>96</b> (in other words, as the seat width direction). One side plate <b>98</b>
        is withdrawn to the right side in the vehicle width direction from an end
        at the left side of the plate <b>96</b>, and stands upright from the surface
        on one side in the thickness direction of the plate <b>96</b>. In contrast,
        the other side plate <b>98</b> is withdrawn to the left side in the vehicle
        width direction from an end at the right side of the plate <b>96</b>, and
        stands upright from the surface on the one side in the thickness direction
        of the plate <b>96</b>.<br />(34) An interval between the left and right side
        plates <b>98</b> is set shorter than a dimension in the longitudinal direction
        of the aperture <b>92</b> (i.e., in the vehicle width direction) in the backboard
        <b>68</b>, while a dimension in the longitudinal direction of each side plate
        <b>98</b> is set shorter than a dimension in the width direction of the aperture
        <b>92</b>. Because of this, the two side plates <b>98</b> can be disposed
        at the inner side of the aperture <b>92</b> in such a way that the longitudinal
        direction of each side plate <b>98</b> extends in the width direction of the
        aperture <b>92</b>.<br />(35) Furthermore, when the thickness direction of
        the plate <b>96</b> is extending roughly in the vehicle up-down direction,
        then the longitudinal direction of the two side plates <b>98</b> extends roughly
        in the vehicle front-rear direction. One end portions in the longitudinal
        direction of the two side plates <b>98</b>, which are the end portions at
        the vehicle front sides thereof when the two side plates <b>98</b> are in
        this state, are joined to the backboard <b>68</b> at vehicle lower-side end
        portions of the aperture <b>92</b>. Moreover, the two side plates <b>98</b>
        are rotatable in directions around an axis (i.e., in the direction shown by
        an arrow A and a direction shown by an arrow B in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG.
        <b>1</b></figref>) centered on the portions where the two side plates <b>98</b>
        are joined to the backboard <b>68</b>, with the axial direction of this rotation
        extending in the vehicle width direction.<br />(36) As a result of the two
        side plates <b>98</b> being rotated in a closing direction (i.e., in the direction
        shown by the arrow A in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>),
        the two side plates <b>98</b> can be inserted inside the aperture <b>92</b>
        in the backboard <b>68</b>. In this way, in a closed state which is when the
        two side plates <b>98</b> have been placed inside the aperture <b>92</b>,
        the thickness direction of the plate <b>96</b> of the cup holder <b>94</b>
        extends roughly in the vehicle front-rear direction, and the aperture <b>92</b>
        is covered from the vehicle rear side by the plate <b>96</b> and is closed
        off.<br />(37) Additionally, a pair of supporting mechanisms <b>100</b> are
        provided at the cup holder <b>94</b>. Each supporting mechanism <b>100</b>
        is provided with a pair of arms <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. These arms <b>102</b>
        and <b>104</b> are formed in a flat plate shape, and the thickness direction
        of the arms <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> is set as the vehicle width direction.
        One end portion in the longitudinal direction of the arms <b>102</b> is joined
        to another end portion in the longitudinal direction of the arms <b>104</b>,
        and the arms <b>102</b> are able to rotate relatively in directions around
        an axis centered on the portions where the arms <b>102</b> are joined to the
        arms <b>104</b>, with the axial direction of this rotation extending in the
        thickness direction of the arms <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>.<br />(38) Another
        end portion in the longitudinal direction of the arm <b>102</b> is joined
        to the backboard <b>68</b> at the upper-left side in the vehicle width direction
        at the inner side of the aperture <b>92</b>. In addition, one end portion
        in the longitudinal direction of the arm <b>104</b> is joined to the other
        end portion in the longitudinal direction of the side plate <b>98</b> on the
        left side in the vehicle width direction. In contrast, another end portion
        in the longitudinal direction of the arm <b>102</b> of the other supporting
        mechanism <b>100</b> is joined to the backboard <b>68</b> at the upper-right
        side in the vehicle width direction at the inner side of the aperture <b>92</b>.
        In addition, one end portion in the longitudinal direction of the arm <b>104</b>
        is joined to the other end portion in the longitudinal direction of the side
        plate <b>98</b> on the right side in the vehicle width direction.<br />(39)
        Furthermore, the arms <b>102</b> of the two supporting mechanisms <b>100</b>
        are able to be rotated relative to the backboard <b>68</b> in directions around
        an axis (i.e., in the direction shown by an arrow C and a direction shown
        by an arrow D in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) centered
        on the portions where the arms <b>102</b> are joined to the backboard <b>68</b>,
        with the axial direction of this rotation extending in the vehicle width direction.
        In contrast to this, the arms <b>104</b> of the two supporting mechanisms
        <b>100</b> are able to be rotated relative to the side plates <b>98</b> in
        directions around an axis (i.e., in the direction shown by an arrow E and
        a direction shown by an arrow F in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>)
        centered on the portions where the arms <b>104</b> are joined to the side
        plates <b>98</b>, with the axial direction of this rotation extending in the
        vehicle width direction.<br />(40) If the two side plates <b>98</b> of the
        cup holder <b>94</b> are rotated in the closing direction (i.e., in the direction
        shown by the arrow A in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>)
        around the portion where the side plates <b>98</b> are joined to the backboard
        <b>68</b>, the arms <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> are also rotated relatively.
        As a result of this, the arms <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> become folded such
        that the other end portion in the longitudinal direction of the arms <b>102</b>
        and the one end portion in the longitudinal direction of the arms <b>104</b>
        are mutually facing each other in the vehicle width direction, and are housed
        in this state inside the aperture <b>92</b>. When the aperture <b>92</b> is
        opened up from this closed state, the cup holder <b>94</b> is rotated in an
        opening direction (i.e., in the direction shown by the arrow B in <figref
        idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) towards the vehicle lower-rear
        side around the join portion where the side plates <b>98</b> are joined to
        the backboard <b>68</b>.<br />(41) In conjunction with the rotation of the
        cup holder <b>94</b> in the opening direction, the arms <b>102</b> are rotated
        relatively to the arms <b>104</b> around the join portions where the arms
        <b>102</b> are joined to the arms <b>104</b> such that the other end portions
        in the longitudinal direction of the arms <b>102</b> move away from the one
        end portions in the longitudinal direction of the arms <b>104</b>. When the
        join portions where the arms <b>102</b> are joined to the backboard <b>68</b>,
        and the join portions where the arms <b>102</b> are joined to the arms <b>104</b>,
        and the join portions where the arms <b>104</b> are joined to the side plates
        <b>98</b> are located at respective straight lines, then any further rotation
        in the opening direction of the cup holder <b>94</b> is restricted, and the
        cup holder <b>94</b> is in its open state.<br />(42) In this open state, the
        other end side in the longitudinal direction of the side plates <b>98</b>
        of the cup holder <b>94</b> are supported at the backboard <b>68</b> via the
        two supporting mechanisms <b>100</b>. In this state, the thickness direction
        of the plate <b>96</b> is roughly the same as the vehicle up-down direction,
        and a plastic drink bottle <b>106</b>, which is serving as a type of article,
        can be placed on the plate <b>96</b>.<br />(43) In addition, the cup holder
        <b>94</b> is provided with an inhibiting portion <b>108</b>. The inhibiting
        portion <b>108</b> is formed in a substantially rectangular plate shape that
        is elongated in the vehicle width direction. Both ends in the longitudinal
        direction of the inhibiting portion <b>108</b> are joined to end portions
        of the side plates <b>98</b> on the opposite side from the end portions thereof
        where the plate <b>96</b> is joined so that the inhibiting portion <b>108</b>
        is disposed facing the plate <b>96</b> while being separated from the plate
        <b>96</b>. A circular hole <b>110</b> is formed at the inhibiting portion
        <b>108</b>. A dimension of an inner diameter of the circular hole <b>110</b>
        is formed, for example, slightly larger than a dimension of an external diameter
        of a typical plastic drink bottle <b>106</b>. Because of this, when the cup
        holder <b>94</b> is in the open state, the plastic drink bottle <b>106</b>
        can be placed on the plate <b>96</b> of the cup holder <b>94</b> with the
        plastic drink bottle <b>106</b> inserted inside the circular hole <b>110</b>.<br
        />Action and Effects of the First Exemplary Embodiment<br />(44) In the vehicle
        <b>12</b> in which the present front seat <b>10</b> has been applied, if,
        for example, the HVAC unit <b>14</b> is operated in cooling mode, cool air
        is produced in the HVAC unit <b>14</b> as an airflow W of conditioned air.
        A portion of the airflow W flows through the front face duct <b>24</b>, and
        is blown as the airflow W<b>1</b> towards the vehicle rear side from the front
        face blower portion <b>26</b>. As a result, the airflow W<b>1</b> can be blown
        towards the upper body of the front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b>, for example,
        towards the vicinity of the face portion of the front-side vehicle occupant
        <b>28</b> who is sitting at the front seat <b>10</b>, so that a cooling sensation
        can be imparted to the front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b>.<br />(45) Moreover,
        in this state, the damper of the switching module <b>44</b> is set to the
        second state. In this state, the one ends of both the rear face duct <b>30</b>
        and the rear foot duct <b>40</b> are partially opened by the damper. As a
        result, the airflow W is split so as to flow to both the rear face duct <b>30</b>
        and the rear foot duct <b>40</b>.<br />(46) The airflow W flows through the
        rear face duct <b>30</b> and is then blown out towards the vehicle upper-rear
        side from the rear face blower portion <b>34</b>, provided at the upper side
        portion of the vehicle rear side end portion of the center console <b>32</b>,
        as the airflow W<b>2</b>. As a result, the airflow W<b>2</b> can be blown
        towards the upper body of the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b> who is
        sitting at the rear seat <b>36</b>, so that a cooling sensation can be imparted
        to the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b>.<br />(47) On the other hand,
        in the second state of the damper of the switching module <b>44</b>, the airflow
        W also flows through the rear foot duct <b>40</b>. In this state, the seat
        lower-side fan <b>54</b> of the seat ventilation system <b>50</b> is operated.
        Because of this, either the large majority of or all of the airflow W flowing
        through the rear foot duct <b>40</b> is suctioned by the seat lower-side fan
        <b>54</b>. As a result, the airflow W<b>4</b> that flows to the branch duct
        <b>52</b> side flows through the branch duct <b>52</b> and the seat-side duct
        <b>56</b> and is then supplied to the seat interior duct <b>58</b>. The airflow
        W<b>4</b> then flows inside the seat interior duct <b>58</b> from one end
        side to the other end side of the seat interior duct <b>58</b>.<br />(48)
        A portion of the airflow W<b>4</b> that arrives at the other end portion of
        the seat interior duct <b>58</b> flows through the left-side duct <b>72</b>
        to the other end side of the left-side duct <b>72</b> as the airflow W<b>5</b>,
        and through the right-side duct <b>74</b> to the other end of the right-side
        duct <b>74</b> as the airflow W<b>6</b>. The airflow W<b>5</b> that is blown
        towards the vehicle front side from the other end of the left-side duct <b>72</b>
        is then blown from the left-side blower portion <b>80</b> further towards
        the vehicle front side, and this airflow W<b>5</b> flows towards the vehicle
        front side along the left-side surface in the vehicle width direction of the
        pad side portion <b>76</b>. In contrast to this, the airflow W<b>6</b> that
        is blown towards the vehicle front side from the other end of the right-side
        duct <b>74</b> is then blown from the right-side blower portion <b>82</b>
        further towards the vehicle front side, and this airflow W<b>6</b> flows towards
        the vehicle front side along the right-side surface in the vehicle width direction
        of the pad side portion <b>76</b>.<br />(49) Here, in this state, the seat
        cushion fan <b>84</b> and the seat back fan <b>86</b> of the seat ventilation
        system <b>50</b> are operated. As a result of the seat cushion fan <b>84</b>
        being operated, on the seat cushion <b>60</b> side of the front seat <b>10</b>,
        an airflow (not shown in the drawings) is generated passing from the vehicle
        front-upper side, the vehicle left-upper side, and the vehicle right-upper
        side and the like of the seat cushion <b>60</b> over the thigh and buttock
        portions of the front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b>. A portion of the airflow
        W<b>1</b> blown from the front face blower portion <b>26</b> towards the vehicle
        rear side merges with the airflow generated by the operation of the seat cushion
        fan <b>84</b>. As a consequence, a portion of the airflow W<b>1</b>, namely,
        of the cool air flows onto the thigh and buttock portions of the front-side
        vehicle occupant <b>28</b>. As a result, a cooling sensation can be effectively
        imparted to the thigh and buttock portions of the front-side vehicle occupant
        <b>28</b>.<br />(50) In contrast, as a result of the seat back fan <b>86</b>
        being operated, air on the vehicle front side of the seat back <b>62</b> is
        taken inside the seat back <b>62</b>. As a consequence, an airflow W<b>7</b>
        is generated that passes from the vehicle left-front side and the vehicle
        right-front side and the like of the seat back <b>62</b> over both sides in
        the vehicle width direction of the body of the front-side vehicle occupant
        <b>28</b>.<br />(51) At least a portion of the above-described airflows W<b>1</b>,
        W<b>5</b> and W<b>6</b> merges with the airflow W<b>7</b> generated by the
        operation of the seat back fan <b>86</b>. As a consequence, at least a portion
        of each of the airflows W<b>1</b>, W<b>5</b>, and W<b>6</b>, namely, of the
        cool air flows at both side portions in the vehicle width direction and the
        like of the body of the front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b>. As a result,
        a cooling sensation can be effectively imparted to the both side portions
        in the vehicle width direction of the body of the front-side vehicle occupant
        <b>28</b>.<br />(52) In this state, if the cup holder <b>94</b> is then placed
        in the opened state, the aperture <b>92</b> of the backboard <b>68</b>, and
        as a consequence, the other end of the rear-side duct <b>90</b> are opened.
        In this state, a portion of the airflow W<b>4</b> that reaches the other end
        portion of the seat interior duct <b>58</b> flows through the interior of
        the rear-side duct <b>90</b> as the airflow W<b>8</b> to the other end side
        of the rear-side duct <b>90</b>. As a result, the airflow W<b>8</b> is blown
        out towards the vehicle rear side from the aperture <b>92</b> in the backboard
        <b>68</b>. As a result, the airflow W<b>8</b>, namely, the cool air can be
        blown onto the upper body of the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b> who
        is sitting at the rear seat <b>36</b>, and a cooling sensation can be imparted
        to the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b>.<br />(53) Moreover, when the
        damper of the switching module <b>44</b> is in the second state, the airflow
        W generated in the HVAC unit <b>14</b> (namely, the cool air) is split so
        as to flow to both the rear face duct <b>30</b> and the rear foot duct <b>40</b>.
        Additionally, in this state, the seat lower-side fan <b>54</b> of the seat
        ventilation system <b>50</b> is operated so that the airflow W is forcibly
        suctioned from the rear foot duct <b>40</b> side. Because of this, the airflow
        W flowing through the rear face duct <b>30</b> is reduced, and the result
        of this is that the airflow W<b>2</b> blown out from the rear face blower
        portion <b>34</b> is also reduced.<br />(54) However, in the present exemplary
        embodiment the airflow W on the rear foot duct <b>40</b> side that has been
        suctioned into the seat lower-side fan <b>54</b> flows through the interior
        of the seat interior duct <b>58</b> as the airflow W<b>4</b>, and a portion
        of this airflow W<b>4</b> additionally flows from the other end portion of
        the seat interior duct <b>58</b> through the rear-side duct <b>90</b> as the
        airflow W<b>8</b>, and is then blown out from the aperture <b>92</b> of the
        backboard <b>68</b> towards the vehicle rear side. As a result, a sufficient
        quantity of cool air, namely, the airflow W<b>2</b> and the airflow W<b>8</b>,
        can be blown onto the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b>, and a cooling
        sensation can be effectively imparted to the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b>.<br
        />(55) In other words, when, for example, the damper of the switching module
        <b>44</b> is in the second state, and when an airflow W having a flow rate
        of, for example, 10 is generated in the HVAC unit <b>14</b>, out of this flow
        rate of 10, an airflow W having a flow rate of, for example, 4 flows through
        the rear face duct <b>30</b>, and an airflow W having a flow rate of 6 flows
        through the rear foot duct <b>40</b>. Accordingly, in this case, although
        an airflow W having a flow rate of 10 is generated in the HVAC unit <b>14</b>,
        an airflow W having a flow rate of only 4 flows to the rear face duct <b>30</b>.<br
        />(56) On the other hand, in this case, an airflow W having a flow rate of
        6 flows to the rear foot duct <b>40</b>. Out of this airflow W having a flow
        rate of 6, an airflow W having a flow rate of, for example, 5 flows through
        the interior of the seat interior duct <b>58</b> as the airflow W<b>4</b>.
        Moreover, out of this airflow W<b>4</b> having a flow rate of 5, an airflow
        W<b>4</b> having a flow rate of 2 flows through the rear-side duct <b>90</b>
        as the airflow W<b>8</b>. Accordingly, although an airflow W having a flow
        rate of only 4 flows to the rear face duct <b>30</b>, the airflow W<b>8</b>
        having a flow rate of 2 flows through the rear-side duct <b>90</b> and is
        blown out towards the vehicle rear side. Because of this, in this case, cool
        air having a flow rate of 6, namely, the sum of the flow rate of 4 of the
        airflow W<b>2</b> blown out from the rear face blower portion <b>34</b> and
        the flow rate of 2 of the airflow W<b>8</b> flowing through the rear side
        duct <b>90</b> can be blown onto the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b>.
        Because of this, a cooling sensation can be more effectively imparted to the
        rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b> compared with a structure in which only
        the airflow W<b>2</b> having a flow rate of 4 is blown through the rear face
        duct <b>30</b> onto the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b>.<br />(57) Furthermore,
        if the airflow W<b>2</b> is blown out from the rear face blower portion <b>34</b>,
        then this airflow W<b>2</b> becomes diffused before it reaches the body of
        the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b> who is sitting at an end side in
        the vehicle width direction of the rear seat <b>36</b> (i.e., on a side closer
        to where one of the front seats <b>10</b> is placed than to the center in
        the vehicle width direction), and the force thereof is weakened. Here, the
        aperture <b>92</b> in the backboard <b>68</b> is provided at the vehicle front
        side of a sitting position at the end side in the vehicle width direction
        of the rear seat <b>36</b> (i.e., on a side closer to where one of the front
        seats <b>10</b> is placed than to the center in the vehicle width direction).<br
        />(58) Because of this, the aperture <b>92</b> in the backboard <b>68</b>
        is closer to the sitting position of the rear seat <b>36</b> than the rear
        face blower portion <b>34</b> provided at the center console <b>32</b> which
        is in the central portion in the vehicle width direction of the front seat
        <b>10</b>. Because of this, compared to the airflow W<b>2</b>, the airflow
        W<b>8</b> undergoes less diffusion prior to reaching the body of the rear-side
        vehicle occupant <b>38</b>, and the force of this airflow W<b>8</b> is maintained.
        In this way, by causing the airflow W<b>8</b> that has less diffusion and
        whose force is maintained to be blown onto the rear-side vehicle occupant
        <b>38</b>, a cooling sensation can be effectively imparted to the rear-side
        vehicle occupant <b>38</b>.<br />(59) Furthermore, the aperture <b>92</b>
        in the backboard <b>68</b> is provided at the vehicle upper side of the rear
        face blower portion <b>34</b> provided at the center console <b>32</b>. Because
        of this, the distance between the aperture <b>92</b> and the upper body portion
        of the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b> is made even closer than the distance
        between the rear face blower portion <b>34</b> and the upper body portion
        of the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b>. Because of this, the airflow
        W<b>8</b> undergoes less diffusion before reaching the upper body portion
        of the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b> than does the airflow W<b>2</b>,
        and the force thereof is also maintained. In this way, by causing the airflow
        W<b>8</b> that has less diffusion and whose force is maintained to be blown
        onto the upper body portion of the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b>, a
        cooling sensation can be effectively imparted to the rear-side vehicle occupant
        <b>38</b>.<br />(60) Furthermore, as has been described above, when the cup
        holder <b>94</b> is in an open state, an article such as the plastic drink
        bottle <b>106</b> or the like can be placed on the plate <b>96</b> of the
        cup holder <b>94</b>. In this state, the airflow W<b>8</b>, which is cool
        air, is blown out from the aperture <b>92</b> in the backboard <b>68</b>.
        Because of this, the plastic drink bottle <b>106</b> and, in turn, the drink
        inside the plastic drink bottle <b>106</b> can be chilled.<br />(61) Additionally,
        the plastic drink bottle <b>106</b> is inserted through the inner side of
        the circular hole <b>110</b> in the inhibiting portion <b>108</b> of the cup
        holder <b>94</b>. In this state, if the plastic drink bottle <b>106</b> is
        moved in the vehicle front-rear direction or in the vehicle width direction
        so that, as a result, the outer circumferential portion of the plastic drink
        bottle <b>106</b> comes up against the inner circumferential portion of the
        circular hole <b>110</b>, then any further movement of the plastic drink bottle
        <b>106</b> in the vehicle front-rear direction or in the vehicle width direction
        is inhibited. As a result, the attitude of the plastic drink bottle <b>106</b>
        on the late 96 can be kept stable.<br />(62) Furthermore, if no rear-side
        vehicle occupant <b>38</b> is sitting at the rear seat <b>36</b> so that,
        as a consequence, the aperture <b>92</b> in the backboard <b>68</b> is closed
        off by the cup holder <b>94</b>, the passage of the airflow W<b>8</b> through
        the aperture <b>92</b> is inhibited (or prevented). Accordingly, in this state,
        the airflow W<b>8</b> passing through the interior of the rear-side duct <b>90</b>
        is either reduced or stopped. As a result, the airflow W<b>5</b> flowing through
        the left-side duct <b>72</b> and the airflow W<b>6</b> flowing through the
        right-side duct <b>74</b> can be increased relatively. As a consequence, a
        cooling sensation can be effectively imparted to the front-side vehicle occupant
        <b>28</b> sitting at the front seat <b>10</b>.<br />(63) Note that in the
        present exemplary embodiment, a structure is employed in which the cup holder
        <b>94</b> is used as the opening/closing device, and the inhibiting portion
        <b>108</b> having the circular hole <b>110</b> is provided at the cup holder
        <b>94</b>. However, it is also possible to employ a structure in which the
        inhibiting portion <b>108</b> is not provided at the opening/closing device,
        and an article is simply placed on top of the plate <b>96</b>. Moreover, it
        is also possible to employ a structure in which, for example, in the open
        state, the portion of the plate <b>96</b> located on the opposite side thereof
        from the portion that is joined to the backboard <b>68</b> is not supported
        on the backboard <b>68</b>, in other words, a structure in which, in the open
        state, it is not possible for an article to be placed on top of the plate
        <b>96</b>.<br />Second Exemplary Embodiment<br />(64) In a second exemplary
        embodiment shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the
        one end of the rear-side duct <b>90</b> is joined to the seat interior duct
        <b>58</b> on the other end side of the seat interior duct <b>58</b> from the
        join portion where the left-side duct <b>72</b> (not shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG.
        <b>5</b></figref>) and the right-side duct <b>74</b> are joined to the seat
        interior duct <b>58</b>.<br />(65) In addition, the present exemplary embodiment
        is provided with a first damper device <b>120</b> which is serving as a restricting
        device. The first damper device <b>120</b> is provided with a first damper
        frame <b>122</b> that forms part of the flow path <b>51</b>. The first damper
        frame <b>122</b> is formed, for example, in a frame shape or a cylindrical
        shape whose opening faces in the vehicle up-down direction. The first damper
        frame <b>122</b> is provided between the join portion where the seat interior
        duct <b>58</b> is joined to the rear-side duct <b>90</b>, and the join portion
        where the seat interior duct <b>58</b> is joined to the left-side duct <b>72</b>
        and the right-side duct <b>74</b>. The airflow W<b>4</b> is able to pass through
        the first damper frame <b>122</b>.<br />(66) In addition, one or more (two
        in the present exemplary embodiment) first dampers <b>124</b> are provided
        at the first damper frame <b>122</b>. The first dampers <b>124</b> are formed
        in a plate shape that is elongated in the vehicle width direction, and portions
        located at both ends in a longitudinal direction of the respective first dampers
        <b>124</b>, each of the portions is located at a substantially central location
        in the width direction of the respective first dampers <b>124</b>, is supported
        at the first damper frame <b>122</b> so as to be able to rotate in directions
        around an axis (i.e., in the direction shown by an arrow G and a direction
        shown by an arrow H in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>),
        with the axial direction of this rotation extending in the vehicle width direction.<br
        />(67) A state in which the width direction of the first dampers <b>124</b>
        extends roughly in the vehicle up-down direction (i.e., the state shown by
        the solid lines in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) is the
        open state (i.e., is an unrestricted state) of the first damper device <b>120</b>.
        In this state, the airflow W<b>4</b> is able to pass through the first damper
        frame <b>122</b>. In contrast to this, a state in which the width direction
        of the first dampers <b>124</b> extends roughly in the vehicle front-rear
        direction (i.e., the state shown by the double-dot chain lines in <figref
        idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) is the closed state (i.e., is a
        restricted state) of the first damper device <b>120</b>. In this state, the
        inside of the first damper frame <b>122</b> is closed off by the first dampers
        <b>124</b>. Because of this, passage of the airflow W<b>4</b> through the
        first damper frame <b>122</b> is inhibited.<br />(68) A rotation shaft of
        the first dampers <b>124</b> is mechanically connected to an output shaft
        of a first damper motor (not shown in the drawings), and the first dampers
        <b>124</b> are rotated by drive force from the first damper motor. The first
        damper motor is electrically connected to a control device (not shown in the
        drawings), and this control device is further electrically connected to a
        first load sensor (not shown in the drawings) that is provided in the front
        seat <b>10</b> which is serving as a front passenger''s seat.<br />(69) The
        first load sensor detects a load that is applied to the front seat <b>10</b>.
        When the first load sensor detects that a load has been applied when the front-side
        vehicle occupant <b>28</b> sits at the front seat <b>10</b>, the first damper
        motor is driven by the control device such that the first damper device <b>120</b>
        is placed in the open state (i.e., in the unrestricted state). In contrast
        to this, when the front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b> is not sitting at
        the front seat <b>10</b>, the load that is applied when the front-side vehicle
        occupant <b>28</b> sits at the front seat <b>10</b> is not detected by the
        first load sensor. In this case, the first damper motor is driven by the control
        device such that the first damper device <b>120</b> is placed in the closed
        state (i.e., in the restricted state).<br />(70) In addition, the present
        exemplary embodiment is also provided with a second damper device <b>126</b>
        which is serving as an opening-closing device. The second damper device <b>126</b>
        is provided with a second damper frame <b>128</b> that forms part of the flow
        path <b>51</b>. The second damper frame <b>128</b> is formed, for example,
        in a frame shape or a cylindrical shape whose opening faces in the vehicle
        front-rear direction. The second damper frame <b>128</b> is attached to an
        end portion on the vehicle rear side of the rear-side duct <b>90</b>, and
        the airflow W<b>8</b> is able to pass through the second damper frame <b>128</b>.<br
        />(71) In addition, one or more (two in the present exemplary embodiment)
        second dampers <b>130</b> are provided at the second damper frame <b>128</b>.
        The second dampers <b>130</b> are formed in a plate shape that is elongated
        in the vehicle width direction, and portions located at both ends in a longitudinal
        direction of the respective second dampers <b>130</b>, each of the portions
        is located at a substantially central location in the width direction of the
        respective second dampers <b>130</b>, are supported at the second damper frame
        <b>128</b> so as to be able to rotate in directions around an axis (i.e.,
        in the direction shown by an arrow J and a direction shown by an arrow K in
        <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>), with the axial direction
        of this rotation extending in the vehicle width direction.<br />(72) A state
        in which the width direction of the second dampers <b>130</b> extends roughly
        in the vehicle front-rear direction (i.e., the state shown by the solid lines
        in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) is the open state of
        the second damper device <b>126</b>. In this state, the airflow W<b>8</b>
        is able to pass through the second damper frame <b>128</b>. In contrast to
        this, a state in which the width direction of the second dampers <b>130</b>
        extends roughly in the vehicle up-down direction (i.e., the state shown by
        the double-dot chain lines in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>)
        is the closed state of the second damper device <b>126</b>. In this state,
        the inside of the second damper frame <b>128</b> is closed off by the second
        dampers <b>130</b>. Because of this, passage of the airflow W<b>8</b> through
        the second damper frame <b>128</b> is inhibited.<br />(73) A rotation shaft
        of the second dampers <b>130</b> is mechanically connected to an output shaft
        of a second damper motor (not shown in the drawings), and the second dampers
        <b>130</b> are rotated by drive force from the second damper motor. The second
        damper motor is electrically connected to a control device (not shown in the
        drawings), and this control device is further electrically connected to a
        second load sensor (not shown in the drawings) that is provided in the rear
        seat <b>36</b>.<br />(74) The second load sensor detects a load that is applied
        to the rear seat <b>36</b>. When the second load sensor detects that a load
        has been applied when the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b> sits at the
        rear seat <b>36</b>, the second damper motor is driven by the control device
        such that the second damper device <b>126</b> is placed in the open state.
        In contrast to this, when the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b> is not
        sitting at the rear seat <b>36</b>, the load that is applied when the rear-side
        vehicle occupant <b>38</b> sits at the rear seat <b>36</b> is not detected
        by the second load sensor. In this case, the second damper motor is driven
        by the control device such that the second damper device <b>126</b> is placed
        in the closed state.<br />(75) Furthermore, the present exemplary embodiment
        is also provided with an airflow deflection device <b>132</b> which is serving
        as an opening-closing device. The airflow deflection device <b>132</b> is
        provided with a frame component <b>134</b> that forms part of the flow path
        <b>51</b>. The frame component <b>134</b> is formed, for example, in a frame
        shape or a cylindrical shape whose opening faces in the vehicle front-rear
        direction. An end portion on the vehicle front side of the frame component
        <b>134</b> is attached to an end portion on the vehicle rear side of the second
        damper frame <b>128</b> of the second damper device <b>126</b>, and the airflow
        W<b>8</b> that has passed through the second damper frame <b>128</b> is able
        to pass through the frame component <b>134</b>. In addition, an end portion
        on the vehicle rear side of the frame component <b>134</b> is inserted through
        the aperture <b>92</b> in the backboard <b>68</b> and is attached to the backboard
        <b>68</b>. Because of this, the airflow W<b>8</b> is blown out towards the
        vehicle rear side through the aperture <b>92</b> in the backboard <b>68</b>
        by passing through the frame component <b>134</b>.<br />(76) Plural first
        fins <b>136</b> which are serving as airflow deflection components are provided
        inside the frame component <b>134</b>. These first fins <b>136</b> are formed
        in a plate shape that is elongated in the vehicle width direction, and are
        arranged in a row at predetermined intervals from each other in the vehicle
        up-down direction. Portions located at both ends in the longitudinal direction
        of the respective first fins <b>136</b>, each of the portions is located at
        a substantially central portion in the width direction of the respective first
        fins <b>136</b>, are supported at the frame component <b>134</b> so as to
        be able to rotate in directions around an axis, with the axial direction of
        this rotation extending in the vehicle width direction.<br />(77) As a result
        of the first fins <b>136</b> being rotated, the angle of inclination in the
        vehicle up-down direction of the first fins <b>136</b> relative to the vehicle
        front-rear direction changes. As a result, when the airflow W<b>8</b> flows
        past the sides of the first fins <b>136</b>, the airflow W<b>8</b> flows along
        the width direction of the first fins <b>136</b> so that the direction of
        flow of the airflow W<b>8</b> changes in the vehicle up-down direction. Furthermore,
        when the first fins <b>136</b> have been rotated such that the width direction
        of the first fins <b>136</b> extends in the vehicle up-down direction, the
        gap between the first fins <b>136</b> that are mutually adjacent in the vehicle
        up-down direction is reduced to a minimum, and passage of the airflow W<b>8</b>
        past the sides of the first fins <b>136</b> is restricted.<br />(78) Plural
        second fins <b>138</b> (in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>,
        only one fin located substantially in the central portion in the vehicle width
        direction is shown), which are serving as airflow deflection components, are
        provided at the vehicle rear side of the first fins <b>136</b> inside the
        frame component <b>134</b>. These second fins <b>138</b> are formed in a plate
        shape that is elongated in the vehicle up-down direction, and are arranged
        in a row at predetermined intervals from each other in the vehicle width direction.
        Portions located at both ends in the longitudinal direction of the respective
        second fins <b>138</b>, each of the portions is located at a substantially
        central location in the width direction of the respective second fins <b>138</b>,
        are supported at the frame component <b>134</b> so as to be able to rotate
        in directions around an axis, with the axial direction of this rotation extending
        in the vehicle up-down direction.<br />(79) As a result of the second fins
        <b>138</b> being rotated, the angle of inclination in the vehicle width direction
        of the second fins <b>138</b> relative to the vehicle front-rear direction
        changes. As a result, when the airflow W<b>8</b> flows past the sides of the
        second fins <b>138</b>, the airflow W<b>8</b> flows along the width direction
        of the second fins <b>138</b> so that the direction of flow of the airflow
        W<b>8</b> change in the vehicle width direction. Furthermore, when the second
        fins <b>138</b> have been rotated such that the width direction of the second
        fins <b>138</b> extends in the vehicle width direction, the gap between the
        second fins <b>138</b> that are mutually adjacent in the vehicle width direction
        is reduced to a minimum, and passage of the airflow W<b>8</b> past the sides
        of the second fins <b>138</b> is restricted.<br />(80) Furthermore, the airflow
        deflection device <b>132</b> is also provided with an operating component
        (not shown in the drawings). The operating component is formed by a dial or
        lever or the like, and this is provided at an end portion at the vehicle rear
        side of the frame component <b>134</b>, or in a position at the backboard
        <b>68</b> where it can be operated by the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b>.
        The operating component is mechanically connected to a rotation shaft of the
        first fins <b>136</b> and to a rotation shaft of the second fins <b>138</b>,
        and the first fins <b>136</b> and the second fins <b>138</b> are rotated as
        a result of this operating component being operated. As a consequence, the
        rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b> is able to adjust the direction of flow
        of the airflow W<b>8</b>.<br />Action and Effects of the Second Exemplary
        Embodiment<br />(81) In the second exemplary embodiment having the structure
        described above, when the front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b> is not sitting
        at the front seat <b>10</b> (i.e., the front passenger''s seat), the load
        that is applied when the front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b> sits at the
        front seat <b>10</b> is not detected by the first load sensor. In this state,
        the first damper motor is driven by the control device such that the first
        damper device <b>120</b> is placed in the closed state (i.e., in the restricted
        state). As a result, the first dampers <b>124</b> are rotated such that the
        width direction of the first dampers <b>124</b> extends roughly in the vehicle
        front-rear direction. As a result, the interior of the first damper frame
        <b>122</b> is closed off by the first dampers <b>124</b>, and passage of the
        airflow W<b>4</b> through the damper frame <b>122</b> is either inhibited
        or prevented. As a result of the flow of the airflow W<b>4</b> towards the
        other end of the seat interior duct <b>58</b> being either inhibited or prevented
        in this way, the flow of the airflow W<b>5</b> inside the left-side duct <b>72</b>,
        and the flow of the airflow W<b>6</b> inside the right-side duct <b>74</b>
        are either inhibited or prevented.<br />(82) In this state, if the rear-side
        vehicle occupant <b>38</b> sits at the rear seat <b>36</b>, and the second
        load sensor detects the load that is applied when the rear-side vehicle occupant
        <b>38</b> is sitting at the rear seat <b>36</b>, then the second damper motor
        is driven by the control device such that the second damper device <b>126</b>
        is placed in the open state. As a result of this, the second dampers <b>130</b>
        are rotated such that the width direction of the second dampers <b>130</b>
        extends roughly in the vehicle front-rear direction. As a result, the interior
        of the second damper frame <b>128</b> is opened up, and the airflow W<b>8</b>
        is able to pass through the second damper frame <b>128</b>.<br />(83) Here,
        in this state, the flow of the airflow W<b>4</b> towards the other end of
        the seat interior duct <b>58</b> is inhibited, and the flow of the airflow
        W<b>5</b> inside the left-side duct <b>72</b> and also the flow of the airflow
        W<b>6</b> inside the right-side duct <b>74</b> are either inhibited or blocked.
        Because of this, the airflow W<b>4</b> flowing from the seat interior duct
        <b>58</b> towards the rear-side duct <b>90</b>, in other words, the airflow
        W<b>8</b> flowing through the rear-side duct <b>90</b> is increased relatively.
        As a result, the airflow W<b>8</b> blown from the vehicle rear-side end portion
        (i.e., the seat rear-side end portion) of the frame component <b>134</b> of
        the airflow deflection device <b>132</b> towards the vehicle rear side, can
        be increased, and a cooling sensation can be imparted effectively to the rear-side
        vehicle occupant <b>38</b> sitting at the rear seat <b>36</b>.<br />(84) Furthermore,
        if, in this state, the operating component of the airflow deflection device
        <b>132</b> is operated by the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b> so that
        the first fins <b>136</b> are rotated such that the width direction of the
        first fins <b>136</b> extends in the vehicle up-down direction, or if the
        second fins <b>138</b> are rotated such that the width direction of the second
        fins <b>138</b> extends in the vehicle width direction, then the passage of
        the airflow W<b>8</b> through the frame component <b>134</b> is either inhibited
        or prevented. As a result, the discharge of the airflow W<b>8</b> from the
        end portion on the vehicle rear side of the frame component <b>134</b> towards
        the vehicle rear side can be either inhibited or prevented. As a result, the
        airflow W<b>8</b> can be inhibited from being blown towards the rear-side
        vehicle occupant <b>38</b>.<br />(85) In contrast, when, for example, the
        rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b> is not sitting at the rear seat <b>36</b>,
        the load that is applied when the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b> sits
        at the rear seat <b>36</b> is not detected by the second load sensor. In this
        state, the second damper motor is driven by the control device such that the
        second damper device <b>126</b> is placed in the closed state. As a result,
        the second dampers <b>130</b> are rotated such that the width direction of
        the second dampers <b>130</b> extends roughly in the vehicle up-down direction.
        The interior of the second damper frame <b>128</b> is closed off by the second
        dampers <b>130</b>. As a consequence, passage of the airflow W<b>8</b> through
        the second damper frame <b>128</b> is either inhibited or prevented and, furthermore,
        the flow of the airflow W<b>4</b> from the seat interior duct <b>58</b> towards
        the rear-side duct <b>90</b> is also inhibited or prevented.<br />(86) In
        this state, if the front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b> sits at the front
        seat <b>10</b>, and the first load sensor detects the load that is applied
        when the front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b> is sitting at the front seat
        <b>10</b>, then the first damper motor is driven by the control device such
        that the first damper device <b>120</b> is placed in the open state (i.e.
        in the unrestricted state). As a result of this, the first dampers <b>124</b>
        are rotated such that the width direction of the first dampers <b>124</b>
        extends roughly in the vehicle up-down direction. The interior of the first
        damper frame <b>122</b> is opened up, and the airflow W<b>4</b> is able to
        pass through the first damper frame <b>122</b>.<br />(87) Here, in this state,
        the flow of the airflow W<b>4</b> from the seat interior duct <b>58</b> towards
        the rear-side duct <b>90</b> is inhibited. Because of this, the airflow W<b>4</b>
        flowing towards the other end of the seat interior duct <b>58</b>, in other
        words, the airflow W<b>5</b> flowing through the left-side duct <b>72</b>
        and also the airflow W<b>6</b> flowing though the right-side duct <b>74</b>
        increase relatively. As a consequence, the airflow W<b>5</b> blown out from
        the left-side blower portion <b>80</b>, and the airflow W<b>6</b> blown out
        from the right-side blower portion <b>82</b> can be increased. As a result
        of the increased airflows W<b>5</b> and W<b>6</b> merging into a flow with
        the airflow W<b>7</b> in this way, a cooling sensation can be effectively
        imparted to the front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b> sitting in the front
        seat <b>10</b>.<br />(88) Note that in the present exemplary embodiment, the
        drive device of the first damper device <b>120</b> that is used to rotate
        the first dampers <b>124</b> is the first damper motor, and the drive device
        of the second damper device <b>126</b> that is used to rotate the second dampers
        <b>130</b> is the second damper motor. However, it is also possible for these
        drive devices to be formed by solenoids in which a magnetic plunger is moved
        when supplied with electric power. In other words, provided that the drive
        device has a structure in which the first dampers <b>124</b> or the second
        dampers <b>130</b> can be rotated by drive force output from the drive device,
        then an optional type of drive device can be employed and the specific type
        thereof is not particularly restricted. In other words, it is also possible
        to employ a structure in which instead of using drive devices such as those
        described above, a damper operating component is provided at a position where
        it can be operated by the front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b> or the rear-side
        vehicle occupant <b>38</b>, and the first damper <b>124</b> or the second
        damper <b>130</b> are rotated as a result of the damper operating component
        being operated manually.<br />(89) Moreover, in the present exemplary embodiment,
        a structure is employed in which the first damper device <b>120</b> which
        is serving as a restricting device, and the second damper device <b>126</b>
        which is serving as an opening/closing device are both provided, however,
        it is also possible to employ a structure in which only one of the restricting
        device and the opening/closing device is provided.<br />(90) Furthermore,
        in the present exemplary embodiment, a structure that is provided with the
        airflow deflection device <b>132</b> is employed, however, it is also possible
        to employ a structure in which the airflow deflection device <b>132</b> is
        not provided. Additionally, this type of airflow deflection device <b>132</b>
        may also be used in the above-described first exemplary embodiment.<br />(91)
        Moreover, in each of the above-described embodiments, a structure is employed
        in which the rear face duct <b>30</b> is provided, and the airflow W<b>2</b>
        is blown towards the upper body portion of the rear-side vehicle occupant
        <b>38</b> from the rear face blower portion <b>34</b> provided at the vehicle
        rear-side end portion of the center console <b>32</b>. However, it is also
        possible to employ a structure in which the rear face duct <b>30</b> is not
        provided, and only the airflow W<b>8</b> that is blown from the rear-side
        duct <b>90</b> towards the vehicle rear side is blown towards the upper body
        portion of the rear-side vehicle occupant <b>38</b>.<br />(92) Furthermore,
        the seat ventilation system <b>50</b> of the above-described respective exemplary
        embodiments is formed such that the airflows W<b>1</b>, W<b>5</b>, and W<b>6</b>,
        which are airflows of cool air, are merged with an airflow generated as a

        W<b>7</b> generated as a result of the seat back fan <b>86</b> being operated,
        and this is used to supply cool air to the vicinity of the body of the front-side
        vehicle occupant <b>28</b>. However, it is also possible to employ a structure
        in which the airflow W<b>4</b>, which is an airflow of cool air, is discharged
        towards the body of the front-side vehicle occupant <b>28</b> from the seat
        cushion <b>60</b> and the seat back <b>62</b> of the front seat <b>10</b>.<br
        />(93) Moreover, in the above-described respective embodiments, a structure
        provided with the seat ventilation system <b>50</b> is employed. However,
        it is also possible to employ a structure in which the left-side duct <b>72</b>
        and the right-side duct <b>74</b> are not provided, and the entire airflow
        W<b>4</b> flowing through the seat interior duct <b>58</b> is supplied to
        the rear-side duct <b>90</b>, and is blown out as the airflow W<b>8</b> (namely,
        as cool air) towards the vehicle rear side of the front seat <b>10</b>.<br
        />(94) Furthermore, in the above-described respective embodiments, a structure
        is described in which the present disclosure is applied to the front seat
        <b>10</b> of the vehicle <b>12</b>. However, it is also possible, for example,
        in a vehicle <b>12</b> in which three or more rows of seats are provided in
        the vehicle front-rear direction of the vehicle <b>12</b>, for the present
        disclosure to be applied to the second and subsequent rows of seats from the
        vehicle front side. In other words, provided that the seat is mounted in the
        vehicle <b>12</b>, then the present disclosure is not limited to the front
        seat <b>10</b> and can be broadly applied.<br />(95) In addition, in the above-described
        respective exemplary embodiments, the respective directions that are based
        on the vehicle <b>12</b>, namely, the vehicle front-rear direction, the vehicle
        up-down direction, and the vehicle width direction, and the like are the same
        as the respective directions based on the front seat <b>10</b>, namely, the
        seat front-rear direction, the seat up-down direction, and the seat width
        direction. However, the present disclosure may also be applied to a vehicle
        <b>12</b> in which the respective directions based on the vehicle <b>12</b>
        and the respective directions based on the front seat <b>10</b> are not the
        same.<br />(96) Exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure have been

        />(1) The present disclosure relates to a vehicle seat that is mounted in
        a vehicle.<br />Related Art<br />(2) A vehicle disclosed, for example, in
        Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No. 2011-194908 is provided with
        a seat air-conditioning duct. One end of the seat air-conditioning duct is
        connected to an air-conditioning device, while another end of the seat air-conditioning
        duct is disposed inside a front seat. Conditioned air (for example, cool air)
        produced by the air-conditioning device flows through the seat air-conditioning
        duct and is subsequently blown out from the other end of the air-conditioning
        duct onto a seating surface side of a seat cushion of the front seat and a
        seat front surface side of a seat back of this front seat.<br />(3) A structure
        may also be considered in which one end of a rear air-conditioning duct, which
        is a different duct from the seat air-conditioning duct, is connected to the
        air-conditioning device, and another end of this rear air-conditioning duct
        opens, for example, at a vehicle rear-side surface of a center console of
        the vehicle so as to blow conditioned air towards the rear seat side.<br />(4)
        If the rear seat is formed by what is known as a bench seat, then vehicle
        occupant seating positions are set at both end sides in the vehicle width
        direction of the rear seat, in other words, at the vehicle rear side of a
        driver''s seat and at the vehicle rear side of a front passenger''s seat on
        the rear seat, and also in a central portion in the vehicle width direction
        on the rear seat.<br />(5) Generally, when vehicle occupants are sitting in
        the rear seat, the seating positions on both end sides in the vehicle width
        direction of the rear seat are used, while if, for example, three vehicle
        occupants are sitting in the rear seat, then the seating position in the central
        portion in the vehicle width direction is also used. In other words, generally,
        it is more common for the seating positions on both end sides in the vehicle
        width direction of the rear seat to be used than the seating position in the
        central portion in the vehicle width direction.<br />(6) Here, the seating
        positions on the end sides in the vehicle width direction of the rear seat
        are located diagonally on the vehicle rear-left side and diagonally on the
        vehicle rear-right side looking from the vehicle rear-side surface of the
        center console, and are somewhat distant from the vehicle rear-side surface
        of the center console. Because of this, it is difficult to ensure that the
        conditioned air blown out from the duct aperture located at the vehicle rear-side
        surface of the center console is supplied efficiently to vehicle occupants
        sitting in the positions on the two end sides in the vehicle width direction
        of the rear seat.<br />SUMMARY<br />(7) The present disclosure was conceived
        in view of the above-described circumstances and provides a vehicle seat that
        enables conditioned air to be supplied efficiently to vehicle occupants sitting
        in the sitting positions on the end sides in the vehicle width direction of
        the rear seat.<br />(8) A vehicle seat of a first aspect of the present disclosure
        includes a seat main body that has a seat back, and the seat main body is
        disposed at a vehicle front side of a seating position at an end side in a
        vehicle width direction of a rear seat; and a flow path having one end side
        and another end side, conditioned air flows through the one end side, the
        conditioned air is produced by an air-conditioning device mounted at the vehicle,
        the other end side is disposed inside the seat main body, another end of the
        flow path opens at a vehicle rear surface of the seat back, and the conditioned
        air flows through the inside of the flow path and is blown from the other
        end towards a vehicle rear side of the seat back.<br />(9) In the vehicle
        seat of the first aspect, conditioned air produced by an air-conditioning
        device flows through a flow path from one end side of that flow path. Another
        end of the flow path opens at a vehicle rear surface of a seat back of the
        seat main body, and conditioned air that flows through the flow path is blown
        from the other end towards the vehicle rear side of the seat back. Here, the
        seat main body is disposed at a vehicle front side of a seating position at
        an end side in the vehicle width direction of the rear seat. Because of this,
        compared with a structure in which the other end side of the flow path is
        situated closer to a central portion in the vehicle width direction than the
        seat main body, a distance between the other end side of the flow path and
        a vehicle occupant who is sitting at a sitting position of an end side in
        the vehicle width direction of the rear seat can be shortened. Accordingly,
        conditioned air can be supplied efficiently to vehicle occupants who are sitting
        at sitting positions of the two end sides in the vehicle width direction of
        the rear seat.<br />(10) A vehicle seat of a second aspect of the present
        disclosure is characterized in that, in the vehicle seat of the first aspect,
        there is provided an opening/closing device that is provided at the flow path
        or at the seat back so as to be able to open and close the flow path, and
        that, when in an open state, allows the conditioned air to be blown towards
        the vehicle rear side of the seat back, and when in a closed state, closes
        off the flow path so as to inhibit or prevent the conditioned air from being
        blown towards the vehicle rear side of the seat back.<br />(11) According
        to the vehicle seat of the second aspect, an opening/closing device is provided
        at the flow path or in the seat back. This opening/closing device is able
        to open and close the flow path, and when the opening/closing device is in
        an open state, it allows the conditioned air flowing through the flow path
        to be blown towards the vehicle rear side of the seat back. In contrast, when
        the opening/closing device is in a closed state, the flow path is closed off
        by the opening/closing device. As a consequence, the discharge of conditioned
        air towards the vehicle rear side of the seat back is either inhibited or
        prevented.<br />(12) A vehicle seat of a third aspect of the present disclosure
        is characterized in that, in the vehicle seat of the second aspect, the opening/closing
        device is provided with a placement portion that is provided at the seat back,
        and when the opening/closing device is in the closed state, the placement
        portion closes off the other end of the flow path, while when the opening/closing
        device is in the open state, the placement portion extends towards the vehicle
        rear side from the seat back, and an article is able to be placed on the placement
        portion at the vehicle rear side of the other end of the flow path.<br />(13)
        According to the vehicle seat of the third aspect, the opening/closing device
        is provided with a placement portion that is provided at the seat back. When
        the opening/closing device is in a closed state, the other end of the flow
        path is closed off by the placement portion. In contrast, when the opening/closing
        device is in an open state, the placement portion extends towards the vehicle
        rear side from the seat back. In this state, an article can be placed on the
        placement portion. Moreover, the article that is placed on the placement portion
        is disposed on the seat rear side of the other end of the flow path. Because
        of this, conditioned air can be blown against the article on the placement
        portion.<br />(14) The vehicle seat of the fourth aspect of the present disclosure
        is characterized in that, in the vehicle seat of the third aspect, the opening/closing
        device is provided with an inhibiting portion that is able to contact the
        article placed on the placement portion from a vehicle front-rear direction
        side and from a vehicle width direction side thereof, and the inhibiting portion,
        by contacting the article, is able to inhibit movement of the article in the
        vehicle front-rear direction and in the vehicle width direction.<br />(15)
        According to the vehicle seat of the fourth aspect, the opening/closing device
        is provided with an inhibiting portion. The inhibiting portion is able to
        contact an article placed on the placement portion from a vehicle front-rear
        direction side and from a vehicle width direction side thereof, and movement
        of the article in the seat front-rear directions and in the seat width directions
        is inhibited by the inhibiting portion coming into contact the article. As
        a result, the attitude of the article can be kept stable on top of the placement
        portion.<br />(16) The vehicle seat of the fifth aspect of the present disclosure
        is characterized in that, in the vehicle seat of any one of the first through
        fourth aspects, the other end of the flow path is disposed further toward
        a vehicle upper side than a vehicle rear-side end portion of a center console
        that is provided closer to a central portion in the vehicle width direction
        than the seat main body.<br />(17) According to the vehicle seat of the fifth
        aspect, the other end of the flow path is disposed at further toward a vehicle
        upper side than a vehicle rear-side end portion of a center console that is
        provided closer to a central portion in the vehicle width direction than the
        seat main body. Because of this, conditioned air can be effectively blown
        towards an upper body of a vehicle occupant who is sitting at a sitting position
        on an end portion side in the vehicle width direction of a rear seat.<br />(18)
        A vehicle seat of a sixth aspect of the present disclosure is characterized
        in that, in the vehicle seat of any one of the first through fifth aspects,
        a branch is formed at the flow path between the one end and the other end
        thereof so that the flow path is able to extend to both sides in the vehicle
        width direction of the seat back and opens at both sides of the seat back,
        and the conditioned air can be discharged through openings at both sides towards
        a vehicle front side of the seat back.<br />(19) According to the vehicle
        seat of the sixth aspect, the flow path is able to discharge conditioned air
        towards the vehicle front side of the seat back. Because of this, conditioned
        air can be supplied effectively to the body of a vehicle occupant sitting
        at the seat main body or to the vicinity of the occupant body.<br />(20) The
        vehicle seat of the seventh embodiment of the present disclosure is characterized
        in that, in the vehicle seat of any one of the first through sixth aspects,
        the vehicle seat further includes a restricting device that is provided at
        the flow path, and the restricting device is able to switch between an unrestricted
        state in which the conditioned air is capable of being blown towards the vehicle
        front side of the seat back, and a restricted state in which the blowing of
        the conditioned air towards the vehicle front side of the seat back is restricted.<br
        />(21) According to the vehicle seat of the seventh aspect, a restricting
        device is provided at the flow path, and the restricting device is able to
        switch between an unrestricted state and a restricted state. When the restricting
        device is in the unrestricted state, conditioned air can be blown towards
        the vehicle front side of the seat back. In contrast to this, when the restricting
        device is in the restricted state, the discharge of conditioned air towards
        the seat front side of the seat back is restricted. As a result, it is possible
        to increase the quantity of conditioned air discharged towards the seat rear
        side by reducing or eliminating the quantity of conditioned air discharged
        towards the vehicle front side of the seat back.<br />(22) As has been described
        above, the vehicle seat of the first aspect enables conditioned air to be
        supplied efficiently to a vehicle occupant sitting at a sitting position on
        an end side in the vehicle width direction of a rear seat.<br />(23) The vehicle
        seat of the second aspect enables conditioned air to be discharged towards
        a vehicle occupant sitting at a rear seat when an opening/closing device is
        in an open state, and enables the discharge of conditioned air towards the
        seat rear side of a seat back to be inhibited when the opening/closing device
        is in a closed state.<br />(24) The vehicle seat of the third aspect enables
        conditioned air to be blown against an article placed on a placement portion
        of the opening/closing device.<br />(25) The vehicle seat of the fourth aspect
        enables the attitude of an article to be kept stable.<br />(26) The vehicle
        seat of the fifth aspect enables conditioned air to be supplied effectively
        to an upper body of a vehicle occupant sitting at a rear seat.<br />(27) The
