        herein.<br />(15) DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br />(16)  The presently disclosed
        subject matter generally relates to an electrically powered fracturing system
        and a system and method for providing on-site electrical power and delivering
        fracturing fluid to a wellbore at a fracturing operation.<br />(17)  In a
        conventional fracturing operation, a &quot;slurry&quot; of fluids and additives
        is injected into a hydrocarbon bearing rock formation at a wellbore to propagate
        fracturing. Low pressure fluids are mixed with chemicals, sand, and, if necessary,
        acid, and then transferred at medium pressure and high rate to vertical and/or
        deviated portions of the wellbore via multiple high pressure, plunger style
        pumps driven by diesel fueled prime movers. The majority of the fluids injected
        will be flowed back through the wellbore and recovered, while the sand will
        remain in the newly created fracture, thus &quot;propping&quot; it open and
        providing a permeable membrane for hydrocarbon fluids and gases to flow through
        so they may be recovered.<br />(18)  According to the illustrative embodiments
        described herein, natural gas (either supplied to the site or produced on-site)
        can be used to drive a dedicated source of electrical power, such as a turbine
        generator, for hydrocarbon-producing wellbore completions. A scalable, electrically
        powered fracturing fleet is provided to deliver pressurized treatment fluid,
        such as fracturing fluid, to a wellbore in a fracturing operation, obviating
        the need for a constant supply of diesel fuel to the site and reducing the
        site footprint and infrastructure required for the fracturing operation, when
        compared with conventional operations. The treatment fluid provided for pressurized
        delivery to the wellbore can be continuous with the wellbore and with one
        or more components of the fracturing fleet, in certain illustrative embodiments.
        In these embodiments, continuous generally means that downhole hydrodynamics
        are dependent upon constant flow (rate and pressure) of the delivered fluids,
        and that there should not be any interruption in fluid flow during delivery
        to the wellbore if the fracture is to propagate as desired. However, it should
        not be interpreted to mean that operations of the fracturing fleet cannot
        generally be stopped and started, as would be understood by one of ordinary
        skill in the art. In certain illustrative embodiments, the treatment fluid
        can comprise a water-based fracturing fluid. In other illustrative embodiments,
        the treatment fluid can comprise a waterless liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)
        fracturing fluid, the use of which conserves water and can reduce formation
        damage caused by introducing water to the wellbore. In certain illustrative
        embodiments, the liquefied petroleum gas can comprise one or more gases from
        the group consisting of propane, butane, propylene and butylene. In other
        illustrative embodiments, the treatment fluid can suitably comprise, consist
        of, or consist essentially of: linear gelled water including but not limited
        to guar, hydroxypropyl guar (&quot;HPG&quot;) and/or carboxymethylhydroxypropyl
        guar (&quot;CMHPG&quot;), gelled water including but not limited to guar/borate,
        HPG/borate, guar/zirconium, HPG/zirconium and/or CMHPG/zirconium, gelled oil,
        slick water, slick oil, poly emulsion, foam/emulsion including but not limited
        to N.sub.2 foam, viscoelastic, and/or CO.sub.2 emulsion, liquid CO.sub.2,
        N.sub.2, binary fluid (CO.sub.2/N.sub.2) and/or acid.<br />(19)  With reference
        to FIG. 1, a site plan for a traditional fracturing operation on an onshore
        site is shown. Multiple trailers 5 are provided, each having at least one
        diesel tank mounted or otherwise disposed thereon. Each trailer 5 is attached
        to a truck 6 to permit refueling of the diesel tanks as required. Trucks 6
        and trailers 5 are located within region A on the fracturing site. Each truck
        6 requires a dedicated operator. One or more prime movers are fueled by the
        diesel and are used to power the fracturing operation. One or more separate
        chemical handling skids 7 are provided for housing of blending tanks and related
        equipment.<br />(20)  With reference to FIG. 2, an illustrative embodiment
        of a site plan for an electrically powered fracturing operation on an onshore
        site is shown. The fracturing operation includes one or more trailers 10,
        each housing one or more fracturing modules 20 (see FIG. 3). Trailers 10 are
        located in region B on the fracturing site. One or more natural gas-powered
        turbine generators 30 are located in region C on the site, which is located
        a remote distance D from region B where the trailers 10 and fracturing modules
        20 are located, for safety reasons. Turbine generators 30 replace the diesel
        prime movers utilized in the site plan of FIG. 1. Turbine generators 30 provide
        a dedicated source of electric power on-site. There is preferably a physical
        separation between the natural gas-based power generation in region C and
        the fracturing operation and wellbore located in region B. The natural gas-based
        power generation can require greater safety precautions than the fracturing
        operation and wellhead. Accordingly, security measures can be taken in region
        C to limit access to this more hazardous location, while maintaining separate
        safety standards in region B where the majority of site personnel are typically
        located. Further, the natural gas powered supply of electricity can be monitored
        and regulated remotely such that, if desired, no personnel are required to
        be within region C during operation.<br />(21)  Notably, the setup of FIG.
        2 requires significantly less infrastructure than the setup shown in FIG.
        1, while providing comparable pumping capacity. Fewer trailers 10 are present
        in region B of FIG. 2 than the trucks 6 and trailers 5 in region A of FIG.
        1, due to the lack of need for a constant diesel fuel supply. Further, each
        trailer 10 in FIG. 2 does not need a dedicated truck 6 and operator as in
        FIG. 1. Fewer chemical handling skids 7 are required in region B of FIG. 2
        than in region A of FIG. 1, as the skids 7 in FIG. 2 can be electrically powered.
        Also, by removing diesel prime movers, all associated machinery necessary
        for power transfer can be eliminated, such as the transmission, torque converter,
        clutch, drive shaft, hydraulic system, etc. . . . , and the need for cooling
        systems, including circulating pumps and fluids, is significantly reduced.
        In an illustrative embodiment, the physical footprint of the on-site area
        in region B of FIG. 2 is about 80% less than the footprint for the conventional
        system in region A of FIG. 1.<br />(22)  With reference to the illustrative
        embodiments of FIG. 3, trailer 10 for housing one or more fracturing modules
        20 is shown. Trailer 10 can also be a skid, in certain illustrative embodiments.
        Each fracturing module 20 can include an electric motor 21 and a fluid pump
        22 coupled thereto. During fracturing, fracturing module 20 is operatively
        associated with turbine generator 30 to receive electric power therefrom.
        In certain illustrative embodiments, a plurality of electric motors 21 and
        pumps 22 can be transported on a single trailer 10. In the illustrative embodiments
        of FIG. 3, four electric motors 21 and pumps 22 are transported on a single
        trailer 10. Each electric motor 21 is paired to a pump 22 as a single fracturing
        module 20. Each fracturing module 20 can be removably mounted to trailer 10
        to facilitate ease of replacement as necessary. Fracturing modules 20 utilize
        electric power from turbine generator 30 to pump the fracturing fluid directly
        to the wellbore.<br />(23)  Electrical Power Generation<br />(24)  The use
        of a turbine to directly drive a pump has been previously explored. In such
        systems, a transmission is used to regulate turbine power to the pump to allow
        for speed and torque control. In the present operation, natural gas is instead
        used to drive a dedicated power source in the production of electricity. In
        illustrative embodiments, the dedicated power source is an on-site turbine
        generator. The need for a transmission is eliminated, and generated electricity
        can be used to power the fracturing modules, blenders, and other on-site operations
        as necessary.<br />(25)  Grid power may be accessible on-site in certain fracturing
        operations, but the use of a dedicated power source is preferred. During startup
        of a fracturing operation, massive amounts of power are required such that
        the use of grid power would be impractical. Natural gas powered generators
        are more suitable for this application based on the likely availability of
        natural gas on-site and the capacity of natural gas generators for producing
        large amounts of power. Notably, the potential for very large instantaneous
        adjustments in power drawn from the grid during a fracturing operation could
        jeopardize the stability and reliability of the grid power system. Accordingly,
        a site-generated and dedicated source of electricity provides a more feasible
        solution in powering an electric fracturing system. In addition, a dedicated
        on-site operation can be used to provide power to operate other local equipment,
        including coiled tubing systems, service rigs, etc. . . .<br />(26)  In an
        illustrative embodiment, a single natural gas powered turbine generator 30,
        as housed in a restricted area C of FIG. 2, can generate sufficient power
        (for example 31 MW at 13,800 volts AC power) to supply several electric motors
        21 and pumps 22, avoiding the current need to deliver and operate each fluid
        pump from a separate diesel-powered truck. A turbine suitable for this purpose
        is a TM2500+ turbine generator sold by General Electric. Other generation
        packages could be supplied by Pratt &amp; Whitney or Kawasaki for example.
        Multiple options are available for turbine power generation, depending on
        the amount of electricity required. In an illustrative embodiment, liquid
        fuels such as condensate can also be provided to drive turbine generator 30
        instead of, or in addition to, natural gas. Condensate is less expensive than
        diesel fuels, thus reducing operational costs.<br />(27)  Fracturing Module<br
        />(28)  With reference to FIGS. 4A and 4B, an illustrative embodiment of fracturing
        module 20 is provided. Fracturing module 20 can include an electric motor
        21 coupled to one or more electric pumps 22, in certain illustrative embodiments.
        A suitable pump is a quintiplex or triplex plunger style pump, for example,
        the SWGS-2500 Well Service Pump sold by Gardner Denver, Inc.<br />(29)  Electric
        motor 21 is operatively associated with turbine generator 30, in certain embodiments.
        Typically, each fracturing module 20 will be associated with a drive housing
        for controlling electric motor 21 and pumps 22, as well as an electrical transformer
        and drive unit 50 (see FIG. 3) to step down the voltage of the power from
        turbine generator 30 to a voltage appropriate for electric motor 21. The electrical
        transformer and drive unit 50 can be provided as an independent unit for association
        with fracturing module 20, or can be permanently fixed to the trailer 10,
        in various embodiments. If permanently fixed, then transformer and drive unit
        50 can be scalable to allow addition or subtraction of pumps 22 or other components
        to accommodate any operational requirements.<br />(30)  Each pump 22 and electric
        motor 21 are modular in nature so as to simplify removal and replacement from
        fracturing module 20 for maintenance purposes. Removal of a single fracturing
        module 20 from trailer 10 is also simplified. For example, any fracturing
        module 20 can be unplugged and unpinned from trailer 10 and removed, and another
        fracturing module 20 can be installed in its place in a matter of minutes.<br
        />(31)  In the illustrative embodiment of FIG. 3, trailer 10 can house four
        fracturing modules 20, along with a transformer and drive unit 50. In this
        particular configuration, each single trailer 10 provides more pumping capacity
        than four of the traditional diesel powered fracturing trailers 5 of FIG.
        1, as parasitic losses are minimal in the electric fracturing system compared
        to the parasitic losses typical of diesel fueled systems. For example, a conventional
        diesel powered fluid pump is rated for 2250 hp. However, due to parasitic
        losses in the transmission, torque converter and cooling systems, diesel fueled
        systems typically only provide 1800 hp to the pumps. In contrast, the present
        system can deliver a true 2500 hp directly to each pump 22 because pump 22
        is directly coupled to electric motor 21. Further, the nominal weight of a
        conventional fluid pump is up to 120,000 lbs. In the present operation, each
        fracturing module 20 weighs approximately 28,000 lbs., thus allowing for placement
        of four pumps 22 in the same physical dimension (size and weight) as the spacing
        needed for a single pump in conventional diesel systems, as well as allowing
        for up to 10,000 hp total to the pumps. In other embodiments, more or fewer
        fracturing modules 20 may be located on trailer 10 as desired or required
        for operational purposes.<br />(32)  In certain illustrative embodiments,
        fracturing module 20 can include an electric motor 21 that is an AC permanent
        magnet motor capable of operation in the range of up to 1500 rpms and up to
        20,000 ft/lbs of torque. Fracturing module 20 can also include a pump 22 that
        is a plunger-style fluid pump coupled to electric motor 21. In certain illustrative
        embodiments, fracturing module 20 can have dimensions of approximately 136''''
        width.times.108'''' length.times.100'''' height. These dimensions would allow
        fracturing module 20 to be easily portable and fit with a ISO intermodal container
        for shipping purposes without the need for disassembly. Standard sized ISO
        container lengths are typically 20'', 40'' or 53''. In certain illustrative
        embodiments, fracturing module 20 can have dimensions of no greater than 136''''
        width.times.108'''' length.times.100'''' height. These dimensions for fracturing
        module 20 would also allow crew members to easily fit within the confines
        of fracturing module 20 to make repairs, as illustrated in FIG. 4b. In certain
        illustrative embodiments, fracturing module 20 can have a width of no greater
        than 102'''' to fall within shipping configurations and road restrictions.
        In a specific embodiment, fracturing module 20 is capable of operating at
        2500 hp while still having the above specified dimensions and meeting the
        above mentioned specifications for rpms and ft/lbs of torque.<br />(33)  Electric
        Motor<br />(34)  With reference to the illustrative embodiments of FIGS. 2
        and 3, a medium low voltage AC permanent magnet electric motor 21 receives
        electric power from turbine generator 30, and is coupled directly to pump
        22. In order to ensure suitability for use in fracturing, electric motor 21
        should be capable of operation up to 1,500 rpm with a torque of up to 20,000
        ft/lbs, in certain illustrative embodiments. A motor suitable for this purpose
        is sold under the trademark TeraTorq.RTM. and is available from Comprehensive
        Power, Inc. of Marlborough, Mass. A compact motor of sufficient torque will
        allow the number of fracturing modules 20 placed on each trailer 10 to be
        maximized.<br />(35)  Blender<br />(36)  For greater efficiency, conventional
        diesel powered blenders and chemical addition units can be replaced with electrically
        powered blender units. In certain illustrative embodiments as described herein,
        the electrically powered blender units can be modular in nature for housing
        on trailer 10 in place of fracturing module 20, or housed independently for
        association with each trailer 10. An electric blending operation permits greater
        accuracy and control of fracturing fluid additives. Further, the centrifugal
        blender tubs typically used with blending trailers to blend fluids with proppant,
        sand, chemicals, acid, etc. . . . prior to delivery to the wellbore are a
        common source of maintenance costs in traditional fracturing operations.<br
        />(37)  With reference to FIGS. 5A-5E and FIGS. 6-7, illustrative embodiments
        of a blender module 40 and components thereof are provided. Blender module
        40 can be operatively associated with turbine generator 30 and capable of
        providing fractioning fluid to pump 22 for delivery to the wellbore. In certain
        embodiments, blender module 40 can include at least one fluid additive source
        44, at least one fluid source 48, and at least one centrifugal blender tub
        46. Electric power can be supplied from turbine generator 30 to blender module
        40 to effect blending of a fluid from fluid source 48 with a fluid additive
        from fluid additive source 44 to generate the fracturing fluid. In certain
        embodiments, the fluid from fluid source 48 can be, for example, water, oils
        or methanol blends, and the fluid additive from fluid additive source 44 can
        be, for example, friction reducers, gellents, gellent breakers or biocides.<br
        />(38)  In certain illustrative embodiments, blender module 40 can have a
        dual configuration, with a first blender unit 47a and a second blender unit
        47b positioned adjacent to each other. This dual configuration is designed
        to provide redundancy and to facilitate access for maintenance and replacement
        of components as needed. In certain embodiments, each blender unit 47a and
        47b can have its own electrically-powered suction and tub motors disposed
        thereon, and optionally, other electrically-powered motors can be utilized
        for chemical additional and/or other ancillary operational functions, as discussed
        further herein.<br />(39)  For example, in certain illustrative embodiments,
        first blender unit 47a can have a plurality of electric motors including a
        first electric motor 43a and a second electric motor 41a that are used to
        drive various components of blender module 40. Electric motors 41a and 43a
        can be powered by turbine generator 30. Fluid can be pumped into blender module
        40 through an inlet manifold 48a by first electric motor 43a and added to
        tub 46a. Thus, first electric motor 43a acts as a suction motor. Second electric
        motor 41a can drive the centrifugal blending process in tub 46a. Second electric
        motor 41a can also drive the delivery of blended fluid out of blender module
        40 and to the wellbore via an outlet manifold 49a. Thus, second electric motor
        41a acts as a tub motor and a discharge motor. In certain illustrative embodiments,
        a third electric motor 42a can also be provided. Third electric motor 42a
        can also be powered by turbine generator 30, and can power delivery of fluid
        additives to blender 46a. For example, proppant from a hopper 44a can be delivered
        to a blender tub 46a, for example, a centrifugal blender tub, by an auger
        45a, which is powered by third electric motor 42a.<br />(40)  Similarly, in
        certain illustrative embodiments, second blender unit 47b can have a plurality
        of electric motors including a first electric motor 43b and a second electric
        motor 41b that are used to drive various components of blender module 40.
        Electric motors 41b and 43b can be powered by turbine generator 30. Fluid
        can be pumped into blender module 40 through an inlet manifold 48b by first
        electric motor 43b and added to tub 46b. Thus, second electric motor 43a acts
        as a suction motor. Second electric motor 41b can drive the centrifugal blending
        process in tub 46b. Second electric motor 41b can also drive the delivery
        of blended fluid out of blender module 40 and to the wellbore via an outlet
        manifold 49b. Thus, second electric motor 41b acts as a tub motor and a discharge
        motor. In certain illustrative embodiments, a third electric motor 42b can
        also be provided. Third electric motor 42b can also be powered by turbine
        generator 30, and can power delivery of fluid additives to blender 46b. For
        example, proppant from a hopper 44b can be delivered to a blender tub 46b,
        for example, a centrifugal blender tub, by an auger 45b, which is powered
        by third electric motor 42b.<br />(41)  Blender module 40 can also include
        a control cabin 53 for housing equipment controls for first blender unit 47a
        and second blender unit 47b, and can further include appropriate drives and
        coolers as required.<br />(42)  Conventional blenders powered by a diesel
        hydraulic system are typically housed on a forty-five foot tractor trailer
        and are capable of approximately 100 bbl/min. In contrast, the dual configuration
        of blender module 40 having first blender unit 47a and second blender unit
        47b can provide a total output capability of 240 bbl/min in the same physical
        footprint as a conventional blender, without the need for a separate backup
        unit in case of failure.<br />(43)  Redundant system blenders have been tried
        in the past with limited success, mostly due to problems with balancing weights
        of the trailers while still delivering the appropriate amount of power. Typically,
        two separate engines, each approximately 650 hp, have been mounted side by
        side on the nose of the trailer. In order to run all of the necessary systems,
        each engine must drive a mixing tub via a transmission, drop box and extended
        drive shaft. A large hydraulic system is also fitted to each engine to run
        all auxiliary systems such as chemical additions and suction pumps. Parasitic
        power losses are very large and the hosing and wiring is complex.<br />(44)  In
        contrast, the electric powered blender module 40 described in certain illustrative
        embodiments herein can relieve the parasitic power losses of conventional
        systems by direct driving each piece of critical equipment with a dedicated
        electric motor. Further, the electric powered blender module 40 described
        in certain illustrative embodiments herein allows for plumbing routes that
        are unavailable in conventional applications. For example, in certain illustrative
        embodiments, the fluid source can be an inlet manifold 48 that can have one
        or more inlet crossing lines 51 (see FIG. 6) that connect the section of inlet
        manifold 48 dedicated to delivering fluid to first blender unit 47a with the
        section of inlet manifold 48 dedicated to delivering fluid to second blender
        unit 47b. Similarly, in certain illustrative embodiments, outlet manifold
        49 can have one or more outlet crossing lines 50 (see FIG. 7) that connect
        the section of outlet manifold 49 dedicated to delivering fluid from first
        blender unit 47a with the section of outlet manifold 49 dedicated to delivering
        fluid from second blender unit 47b. Crossing lines 50 and 51 allow flow to
        be routed or diverted between first blender unit 47a and second blender unit
        47b. Thus, blender module 40 can mix from either side, or both sides, and/or
        discharge to either side, or both sides, if necessary. As a result, the attainable
        rates for the electric powered blender module 40 are much larger that of a
        conventional blender. In certain illustrative embodiments, each side (i.e.,
        first blender unit 47a and second blender unit 47b) of blender module 40 is
        capable of approximately 120 bbl/min. Also, each side (i.e., first blender
        unit 47a and second blender unit 47b) can move approximately 15 t/min of sand,
        at least in part because the length of auger 45 is shorter (approximately
        6'') as compared to conventional units (approximately 12'').<br />(45)  In
        certain illustrative embodiments, blender module 40 can be scaled down or
        &quot;downsized&quot; to a single, compact module comparable in size and dimensions
        to fracturing module 20 described herein. For smaller fracturing or treatment
        jobs requiring fewer than four fracturing modules 20, a downsized blender
        module 40 can replace one of the fracturing modules 20 on trailer 10, thus
        reducing operational costs and improving transportability of the system.<br
        />(46)  Control System<br />(47)  A control system can be provided for regulating
        various equipment and systems within the electric powered fractioning operation.
        For example, in certain illustrative embodiments, the control system can regulate
        fracturing module 20 in delivery of treatment fluid from blender module 30
        to pumps 22 for delivery to the wellbore. Controls for the electric-powered
        operation described herein are a significant improvement over that of conventional
        diesel powered systems. Because electric motors are controlled by variable
        frequency drives, absolute control of all equipment on location can be maintained
        from one central point. When the system operator sets a maximum pressure for
        the treatment, the control software and variable frequency drives calculate
        a maximum current available to the motors. Variable frequency drives essentially
        &quot;tell&quot; the motors what they are allowed to do.<br />(48)  Electric
        motors controlled via variable frequency drive are far safer and easier to
        control than conventional diesel powered equipment. For example, conventional
        fleets with diesel powered pumps utilize an electronically controlled transmission
        and engine on the unit. There can be up to fourteen different parameters that
        need to be monitored and controlled for proper operation. These signals are
        typically sent via hardwired cable to an operator console controlled by the
        pump driver. The signals are converted from digital to analog so the inputs
        can be made via switches and control knobs. The inputs are then converted
        from analog back to digital and sent back to the unit. The control module
        on the unit then tells the engine or transmission to perform the required
        task and the signal is converted to a mechanical operation. This process takes
        time.<br />(49)  Accidental over-pressures are quite common in these conventional
        operations, as the signal must travel to the console, back to the unit and
        then perform a mechanical function. Over-pressures can occur in milliseconds
        due to the nature of the operations. These are usually due to human error,
        and can be as simple as a single operator failing to react to a command. They
        are often due to a valve being closed, which accidentally creates a &quot;deadhead&quot;
        situation.<br />(50)  For example, in January of 2011, a large scale fractioning
        operation was taking place in the Horn River Basin of north-eastern British
        Columbia, Canada. A leak occurred in one of the lines and a shutdown order
        was given. The master valve on the wellhead was then closed remotely. Unfortunately,
        multiple pumps were still rolling and a system over-pressure ensued. Treating
        iron rated for 10,000 psi was taken to well over 15,000 psi. A line attached
        to the well also separated, causing it to whip around. The incident caused
        a shutdown interruption to the entire operation for over a week while investigation
        and damage assessment were performed.<br />(51)  The control system provided
        according to the present illustrative embodiments, being electrically powered,
        virtually eliminates these types of scenarios from occurring. A maximum pressure
        value set at the beginning of the operation is the maximum amount of power
        that can be sent to electric motor 21 for pump 22. By extrapolating a maximum
        current value from this input, electric motor 21 does not have the available
        power to exceed its operating pressure. Also, because there are virtually
        no mechanical systems between pump 22 and electric motor 21, there is far
        less &quot;moment of inertia&quot; of gears and clutches to deal with. A near
        instantaneous stop of electric motor 21 results in a near instantaneous stop
        of pump 22.<br />(52)  An electrically powered and controlled system as described
        herein greatly increases the ease in which all equipment can be synced or
        slaved to each other. This means a change at one single point will be carried
        out by all pieces of equipment, unlike with diesel equipment. For example,
        in conventional diesel powered operations, the blender typically supplies
        all the necessary fluids to the entire system. In order to perform a rate
        change to the operation, the blender must change rate prior to the pumps changing
        rates. This can often result in accidental overflow of the blender tubs and/or
        cavitation of the pumps due to the time lag of each piece of equipment being
        given manual commands.<br />(53)  In contrast, the present operation utilizes
        a single point control that is not linked solely to blender operations, in
        certain illustrative embodiments. All operation parameters can be input prior
        to beginning the fractioning. If a rate change is required, the system will
        increase the rate of the entire system with a single command. This means that
        if pumps 22 are told to increase rate, then blender module 40 along with the
        chemical units and even ancillary equipment like sand belts will increase
        rates to compensate automatically.<br />(54)  Suitable controls and computer
        monitoring for the entire fracturing operation can take place at a single
        central location, which facilitates adherence to pre-set safety parameters.
        For example, a control center 40 is indicated in FIG. 2 from which operations
        can be managed via communications link 41. Examples of operations that can
        be controlled and monitored remotely from control center 40 via communications
        link 41 can be the power generation function in Area B, or the delivery of
        treatment fluid from blender module 40 to pumps 22 for delivery to the wellbore.<br
        />(55) COMPARISON EXAMPLE<br />(56)  Table 1, shown below, compares and contrasts
        the operational costs and manpower requirements for a conventional diesel
        powered operation (such as shown in FIG. 1) with those of a electric powered
        operation (such as shown in FIG. 2).<br />(57)   TABLE-US-00001 TABLE 1 Comparison
        of Conventional Diesel Powered Operation vs. Electric Powered Operation Diesel
        Powered Operation\tElectric Powered Operation Total fuel cost (diesel) -\tTotal
        fuel cost (natural gas) - about $80,000 per day\tabout $2,300 per day Service
        interval for diesel engines -\tService interval for electric motor - about
        every 200-300 hours\tabout every 50,000 hours Dedicated crew size -\tDedicated
        crew size - about 40 people\tabout 10 people<br />(58)  In Table 1, the &quot;Diesel
        Powered Operation&quot; utilizes at least 24 pumps and 2 blenders, and requires
        at least 54,000 hp to execute the fracturing program on that location. Each
        pump burns approximately 300-400 liters per hour of operation, and the blender
        units burn a comparable amount of diesel fuel. Because of the fuel consumption
        and fuel capacity of this conventional unit, it requires refueling during
        operation, which is extremely dangerous and presents a fire hazard. Further,
        each piece of conventional equipment needs a dedicated tractor to move it
        and a driver/operator to run it. The crew size required to operate and maintain
        a conventional operation such as the one in FIG. 1 represents a direct cost
        for the site operator.<br />(59)  In contrast, the electric powered operation
        as described herein utilizes a turbine that only consumes about 6 mm scf of
        natural gas per 24 hours. At current market rates (approximately $2.50 per
        mmbtu), this equates to a reduction in direct cost to the site operator of
        over $77,000 per day compared to the diesel powered operation. Also, the service
        interval on electric motors is about 50,000 hours, which allows the majority
        of reliability and maintainability costs to disappear. Further, the need for
        multiple drivers/operators is reduced significantly, and electric powered
        operation means that a single operator can run the entire system from a central
        location. Crew size can be reduced by around 75%, as only about 10 people
        are needed on the same location to accomplish the same tasks as conventional
        operations, with the 10 people including off-site personnel maintenance personnel.
        Further, crew size does not change with the amount of equipment used. Thus,
        the electric powered operation is significantly more economical.<br />(60)
        Modular Design and Alternate Embodiments<br />(61)  As discussed above, the
        modular nature of the electric powered fracturing operation described herein
        provides significant operational advantages and efficiencies over traditional
        fracturing systems. Each fracturing module 20 sits on trailer 10 which houses
        the necessary mounts and manifold systems for low pressure suctions and high
        pressure discharges. Each fracturing module 20 can be removed from service
        and replaced without shutting down or compromising the fractioning spread.
        For instance, pump 22 can be isolated from trailer 10, removed and replaced
        by a new pump 22 in just a few minutes. If fracturing module 20 requires service,
        it can be isolated from the fluid lines, unplugged, un-pinned and removed
        by a forklift. Another fracturing module 20 can be then re-inserted in the
        same fashion, realizing a drastic time savings. In addition, the removed fracturing
        module 20 can be repaired or serviced in the field. In contrast, if one of
        the pumps in a conventional diesel powered system goes down or requires service,
        the tractor/trailer combination needs to be disconnected from the manifold
        system and driven out of the location. A replacement unit must then be backed
        into the line and reconnected. Maneuvering these units in these tight confines
        is difficult and dangerous.<br />(62)  The presently described electric powered
        fracturing operation can be easily adapted to accommodate additional types
        of pumping capabilities as needed. For example, a replacement pumping module
        can be provided that is adapted for removable mounting on trailer 10. Replacement
        pumping module can be utilized for pumping liquid nitrogen, carbon dioxide,
        or other chemicals or fluids as needed, to increase the versatility of the
        system and broaden operational range and capacity. In a conventional system,
        if a nitrogen pump is required, a separate unit truck/trailer unit must be
        brought to the site and tied into the fractioning spread. In contrast, the
        presently described operation allows for a replacement nitrogen module with
        generally the same dimensions as fractioning module 20, so that the replacement
        module can fit into the same slot on the trailer as fractioning module 20
        would. Trailer 10 can contain all the necessary electrical power distributions
        as required for a nitrogen pump module so no modifications are required. The
        same concept would apply to carbon dioxide pump modules or any other pieces
        of equipment that would be required. Instead of another truck/trailer, a specialized
        replacement module can instead be utilized.<br />(63)  Natural gas is considered
        to be the cleanest, most efficient fuel source available. By designing and
        constructing &quot;fit for purpose equipment&quot; that is powered by natural
        gas, it is expected that the fracturing footprint, manpower, and maintenance
        requirements can each be reduced by over 60% when compared with traditional
        diesel-powered operations.<br />(64)  In addition, the presently described
        electric powered fracturing operation resolves or mitigates environmental
        impacts of traditional diesel-powered operations. For example, the presently
        described natural gas powered operation can provide a significant reduction
        in carbon dioxide emissions as compared to diesel-powered operations. In an
        illustrative embodiment, a fractioning site utilizing the presently described
        natural gas powered operation would have a carbon dioxide emissions level
        of about 2200 kg/hr, depending upon the quality of the fuel gas, which represents
        an approximately 200% reduction from carbon dioxide emissions of diesel-powered
        operations. Also, in an illustrative embodiment, the presently described natural
        gas powered operation would produces no greater than about 80 decibels of
        sound with a silencer package utilized on turbine 30, which meets OSHA requirements
        for noise emissions. By comparison, a conventional diesel-powered fractioning
        pump running at full rpm emits about 105 decibels of sound. When multiple
        diesel-powered fractioning pumps are running simultaneously, noise is a significant
        hazard associated with conventional operations.<br />(65)  In certain illustrative
        embodiments, the electric-powered fractioning operation described herein can
        also be utilized for offshore oil and gas applications, for example, fracturing
        of a wellbore at an offshore site. Conventional offshore operations already
        possess the capacity to generate electric power on-site. These vessels are
        typically diesel over electric, which means that the diesel powerplant on
        the vessel generates electricity to meet all power requirements including
        propulsion. Conversion of offshore pumping services to run from an electrical
        power supply will allow transported diesel fuel to be used in power generation
        rather than to drive the fracturing operation, thus reducing diesel fuel consumption.
        The electric power generated from the offshore vessel''s power plant (which
        is not needed during station keeping) can be utilized to power one or more
        fracturing modules 10. This is far cleaner, safer and more efficient than
        using diesel powered equipment. Fracturing modules 10 are also smaller and
        lighter than the equipment typically used on the deck of offshore vessels,
        thus removing some of the current ballast issues and allowing more equipment
        or raw materials to be transported by the offshore vessels.<br />(66)  In
        a deck layout for a conventional offshore stimulation vessel, skid based,
        diesel powered pumping equipment and storage facilities on the deck of the
        vessel create ballast issues. Too much heavy equipment on the deck of the
        vessel causes the vessel to have higher center of gravity. Also, fuel lines
        must be run to each piece of equipment greatly increasing the risk of fuel
        spills. In illustrative embodiments of a deck layout for an offshore vessel
        utilizing electric-powered fractioning operations as described herein, the
        physical footprint of the equipment layout is reduced significantly when compared
        to the conventional layout. More free space is available on deck, and the
        weight of equipment is dramatically decreased, thus eliminating most of the
        ballast issues. A vessel already designed as diesel-electric can be utilized.
        When the vessel is on station at a platform and in station keeping mode, the
        vast majority of the power that the ship''s engines are generating can be
        run up to the deck to power modules. The storage facilities on the vessel
        can be placed below deck, further lowering the center of gravity, while additional
        equipment, for instance, a 3-phase separator, or coiled tubing unit, can be
        provided on deck, which is difficult in existing diesel-powered vessels. These

        />(2)  1. Field of Invention<br />(3)  This invention relates generally to
        hydraulic stimulation of underground hydrocarbon-bearing formations, and more
        particularly, to the generation and use of electrical power to deliver fracturing
        fluid to a wellbore.<br />(4)  2. Description of the Related Art<br />(5)  Over
        the life cycle of a typical hydrocarbon-producing wellbore, various fluids
        (along with additives, proppants, gels, cement, etc. . . . ) can be delivered
        to the wellbore under pressure and injected into the wellbore. Surface pumping
        systems must be able to accommodate these various fluids. Such pumping systems
        are typically mobilized on skids or tractor-trailers and powered using diesel
        motors.<br />(6)  Technological advances have greatly improved the ability
        to identify and recover unconventional oil and gas resources. Notably, horizontal
        drilling and multi-stage fracturing have led to the emergence of new opportunities
        for natural gas production from shale formations. For example, more than twenty
        fractured intervals have been reported in a single horizontal wellbore in
        a tight natural gas formation. However, significant fracturing operations
        are required to recover these resources.<br />(7)  Currently contemplated
        natural gas recovery opportunities require considerable operational infrastructure,
        including large investments in fracturing equipment and related personnel.
        Notably, standard fluid pumps require large volumes of diesel fuel and extensive
        equipment maintenance programs. Typically, each fluid pump is housed on a
        dedicated truck and trailer configuration. With average fracturing operations
        requiring as many as fifty fluid pumps, the on-site area, or &quot;footprint&quot;,
        required to accommodate these fracturing operations is massive. As a result,
        the operational infrastructure required to support these fracturing operations
        is extensive. Greater operational efficiencies in the recovery of natural
        gas would be desirable.<br />(8)  When planning large fracturing operations,
        one major logistical concern is the availability of diesel fuel. The excessive
        volumes of diesel fuel required necessitates constant transportation of diesel
        tankers to the site, and results in significant carbon dioxide emissions.
        Others have attempted to decrease fuel consumption and emissions by running
        large pump engines on &quot;Bi-Fuel&quot;, blending natural gas and diesel
        fuel together, but with limited success. Further, attempts to decrease the
        number of personnel on-site by implementing remote monitoring and operational
        control have not been successful, as personnel are still required on-site
        to transport the equipment and fuel to and from the location.<br />(9) SUMMARY<br

        DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br />(14)  FIG. 1 depicts an example of an analysis system
        130 that automatically generates models for normal network session activity
        and uses the models to identify outliers and detect significant web session
        events. The analysis system 130 accesses stored web session events data 118
        from a database referred to as a session archive 132. Web session events data
        118 may contain important information about user experiences during the web
        sessions 100. However, as explained above, revealing this information may
        not be straightforward. For example, a drop in online sales may be associated
        with a group of web session events happening coherently at certain periods.
        In this case it is practically impossible to detect and explain this anomaly
        by cherry-picking and monitoring individual events data. Moreover, other web
        session events 118 incorrectly selected from session archive 132 may produce
        other error messages preventing an operator from correlating the significance
        of particular user interface events data with the drop in sales.<br />(15)  Analysis
        system 130 deals with these problems by analyzing the whole set of available
        web session events and by automatically selecting only those events that are
        informationally important for the model. This way, analysis system 130 actually
        turns the problems associated with too many web session events into an asset
        by using the large number of different web session events to generate a more
        holistic model of the e-commerce system while at the same time isolating the
        most likely causes of abnormal e-commerce system behavior.<br />(16)  Analysis
        system 130 generates a network session model 136 that models normal operating
        web sessions. Model 136 may identify outliers in the model space that indicate
        unusual web session operations and identify the list of web session events
        142 that have the highest contributions to the outliers.<br />(17)  The web
        session modeling can also minimize the number of false alarms. For example,
        certain events may appear to be outliers when analyzed individually. However,
        the multivariate web session model can determine that such web session conditions
        are associated with normal web site operations or can determine that certain
        web session events have little significance to an abnormal web session condition.
        Analysis system 130 can also identify duplicate web session events that may
        operate in a same manner in the web session model but may be given different
        event names. For example, events producing the same results can be inadvertently
        created by different departments of the company. One of the duplicated events
        can then be removed from further capture operations.<br />(18)  Web Session
        Events<br />(19)  Web sessions 100 may be conducted between a web application
        104 operating on a web server 102 and different user devices 110. Web application
        104 may be configured for any type of online session such as online purchases
        or online financial services. Of course, these are just examples, and any
        type of electronic web based transaction or online activity may be performed
        using web application 104.<br />(20)  User device 110 may comprise a Personal
        Computer (PC), laptop computer, wireless Personal Digital Assistant (PDA),
        cellular telephone, or any other wired or wireless device that accesses and
        exchanges information with web application 104. It should be understood that
        multiple user devices 110 may conduct different web sessions 100 with web
        application 104. However, for explanation purposes, only one user device 110
        is shown in FIG. 1.<br />(21)  User device 110 may communicate with web application
        104 over a network connection 108. Network connection 108 may comprise any
        combination of connections over an Internet network, a wireless network, a
        telephone network, Public Services Telephone Network (PSTN), a cellular network,
        a Wi-Fi network, a cable network, a Wide Area Network (WAN), a Local Area
        Network (LAN), or the like, or any combination thereof.<br />(22)  In one
        example, user device 110 may send a Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request
        to web application 104 over network connection 108. Web application 104 may
        send back one or more of webpages 106 in response to the HTTP request and
        user device 110 may display the webpages 106 via a web browser 112 on a screen
        of user device 110. A user may generate user interface (UI) events during
        the web session 100. For example, the user may select links on displayed webpages
        106 or enter keystrokes that insert data into fields within the displayed
        webpages 106. Web application 104 may send additional webpages 106 and/or
        responses to user device 110 in response to the user interface events.<br
        />(23)  Different web session monitors 116 and/or 120 may capture web session
        events 118 during web sessions 100. Web session events 118 may comprise the
        user interface events generated on user device 110 and any network data transferred
        over network connection 108 between user device 100 and web application 104.
        For example, the web session events 118 may comprise the HTTP requests and
        other data requests sent from user device 110 to web application 104 and the
        webpages and other responses sent back to user device 110 from web application
        104.<br />(24)  Some of the web session events 118 may never be transferred
        over network connection 108. For example, some of the user interface events,
        such as mouse clicks, keystrokes, alpha-numeric data entered into webpage
        fields, selection of webpage icons, or the like, or any combination thereof,
        may change a current state of webpage 106 without sending any data over network
        connection 108. In another example, a batch data transfer of only completed
        information from webpage 106 may be transferred to web application 104 over
        network connection 108.<br />(25)  Some of the web session events 118 may
        comprise data sent from web application 104 in response user interface events.
        For example, web session events 118 may include airline scheduling data used
        for populating a drop down menu in a previously downloaded webpage 106. The
        airline scheduling data may have been sent by web application 104 in response
        to a user entering a city destination into an airline destination field of
        displayed webpage 106.<br />(26)  Other web session events 118 may comprise
        webpage logic/code sent by web application 104 along with the webpages 106
        to user device 110 that further determine the different states or operations
        in the webpage. The webpage logic may autonomously change the state of webpages
        106 or the state of web session 100 on user device 110 without ever sending
        a request or information back over network connection 108 to web application
        104.<br />(27)  In another example, some web session events 118 may comprise
        Document Object Model (DOM) changes within webpages 106. For example, changes
        in the DOM of displayed webpage 106 may be captured by UI event monitor 116
        as some of web session events 118. In yet another example, web session events
        118 may comprise operating parameters and any other logged data in user device
        110 and/or server 102. For example, web session events 118 may comprise network
        bandwidth indicators, processor bandwidth indicators, network condition indicators,
        computer operating conditions, or the like, or any combination thereof.<br
        />(28)  In one example, network session monitor 120 may capture the network
        data, such as the webpages 106, requests, responses, and/or logic exchanged
        between user device 110 and web application 104 over network connection 108.
        User Interface (UI) monitor 116 may capture the user interface events generated
        locally at user device 110. In another example, UI monitor 116 also may capture
        some or all of the network data exchanged between user device 110 and web
        application 104 over network connection 108.<br />(29)  In yet another example,
        UI event monitor 116 and/or network session monitor 120 may not capture some
        or all the actual web session events 118 but may only detect occurrences of
        some web session events 118. In this example, monitors 116 and 120 may send
        unique identifiers identifying occurrences of web session events 118 and may
        send timestamps indicating when the web session events were detected.<br />(30)  Examples
        of systems for capturing and/or identifying web session events are described
        in U.S. Pat. No. 6,286,030 issued Sep. 4, 2001, entitled: Systems and Methods

        No. 13/419,179 filed Mar. 13, 2012, entitled: Method and Apparatus for Intelligent
        Capture of Document Object Model Events which are all herein incorporated
        by reference in their entirety.<br />(31)  Web Session Modeling and Monitoring<br
        />(32)  Web session modeling and monitoring consists of two separate modules:
        modeling and monitoring. The modeling module works with historical data and
        creates the model of normal activity. The monitoring module uses the model
        saved by the modeling module and works with the current web session data,
        such as web session events captured during the last hour.<br />(33)  During
        a model generation phase, analysis system 130 may operate a model generator
        134 for generating network session model 136 from web session events 133 associated
        with a historical model generation time period for web sessions 100. For example,
        such historical period may comprise the last one to three months data on web
        sessions 100. Network session model 136 may model a normal operating condition
        for web sessions 100 and the computer system operating web sessions 100.<br
        />(34)  Analysis system 130 may generate reports 140 listing the outliers
        of the normal operating conditions and identifying web session events 142
        associated with the outliers. Network session model 136 also may identify
        which web session events 142 have the highest impact in the associated outliers.<br
        />(35)  Model generator 134 may select which captured web session events 133
        in session archive 132 to use for generating network session model 136. For
        example, some web session events 118 may be associated with temporary operating
        conditions, such as a yearly sales promotion. The sales promotion events may
        not be associated with normal online operating conditions and may be removed
        from generating model 136 and from reports 140.<br />(36)  During a second
        monitoring phase, analysis system 130 may use web session model 136 to monitor
        new web session events 138 from web sessions 100. For example, new web session
        events 138 may comprise web session events periodically captured and aggregated
        over a last several minutes, hour, day, week, etc. The number of occurrences
        for each type of web session event 138 may be aggregated over the monitoring
        time period. For example, there may be 157 online purchases detected during
        a last one hour monitoring time period.<br />(37)  Web session events 138
        for the monitoring time period are applied to network session model 136 and
        may operate within the found normal operating model boundaries or as an outlier
        operating outside the model boundaries. Statistical significance of an outlier
        being outside the model boundaries may be set to the values that suggest some
        real business reasons for abnormal behavior. Detected outlier reports 140
        are sent to a pre-defined list of addressees. The most influential web session
        events 142 either for the outlier or for the normal operating time period
        may be identified in reports 140.<br />(38)  The time periods, thresholds,
        and other parameters used for generating model 136 and for identifying outliers
        within model 136 may be preconfigured in a configuration file 135. Configuration
        file 135 also may identify black-listed web session events that are removed
        prior to generating model 136 or removed from reports 140.<br />(39)  The
        first modeling module (model creation) can either be executed manually or
        scheduled to be executed automatically. In the latter case the periodicity
        of model re-creation depends on the length of the historical period used for
        the model generation. For example, if one month of data is used to create
        a model, then the model may be re-created at least every 3 weeks or every
        month. For the second module, web session monitoring is typically scheduled
        to run automatically and the periodicity of monitoring depends on aggregation
        granularity. For example, the monitor should be scheduled to run hourly if
        web session events are aggregated on an hourly basis. In the fully automated
        mode, after the initial setup, the system may run and provide valuable business
        insights without any additional human interaction.<br />(40)  Analysis system
        130 may be configured to catch and use newly created web session events on
        the fly. After initial setup, analysis system 130 may operate automatically,
        or an operator may choose to manually create web session model 136 by selecting
        specific web session events 118. However, the operator is not required to
        pre-select any web session events 118, facts, or any other specific information
        regarding web sessions 100. The operator also does not need to manually correlate
        or analyze any data distribution results. Thus, the operator does not need
        to manually pre-select between thousands of possible web session events for
        analysis.<br />(41)  Analysis system 130 provides a powerful and easy-to-use
        and to easy-to-interpret system for automatically monitoring the health of
        e-commerce systems. Multivariate modeling may be used to increase scalability
        over univariate approaches, since using a wider variety of web session events
        118 can model more business aspects of the e-commerce system and create a
        better holistic representation of user experiences during web sessions 100.<br
        />(42)  FIG. 2 depicts an example process for generating a web session model
        for the first module of the system, the model creation. In operation 148,
        the analysis system may recreate a new model each historical modeling period.
        For example, a new model may be recreated each month. In operation 150, a
        configuration file may be checked to identify any model parameters used for
        generating the model. For example, parameters in the configuration file 135
        in FIG. 1 may designate threshold levels used for identifying web session
        outliers, details on the ODBC connection to the web session database, email
        server configuration for alert notification and so on.<br />(43)  In operation
        152, web session events may be extracted from the session archive database
        for the historical model period. For example, the web session events may have
        associated timestamps and the analysis system may extract the web session
        events from the session archive for the last month of timestamps. In operation
        154, the extracted web session events are processed. For example, not all
        web session events may occur every hour. Missing events are usually not present
        in the extracted data for a given timestamp. The operation 154 includes processing
        the missed events and other data cleaning procedures. In operation 156, the
        model generator may calculate the web session model from the processed web
        session events. For example, the model generator may generate a multivariate
        mathematical model from occurrences of the web session events.<br />(44)  In
        operation 158, outliers are detected for the web session model. For example,
        the data point associated with a certain timestamp period may be projected
        by the modeling transformation outside of a normal operating threshold of
        the model. The outlying timestamp periods are identified in operation 158.
        Reports may be generated in operation 160 that identify the most significant
        web session events for the detected outliers. Such reports contain the outlier
        timestamps and the list of the highest contributing events for each outlier
        timestamp.<br />(45)  In operation 162, the created multivariate model together
        with all transformation parameters used to create the model and thresholds
        used to detect the outliers, are saved onto the hard drive for subsequent
        usage by the second module of the system, the real-time monitoring module.<br
        />(46)  FIG. 3 depicts example operations for processing the web session events
        prior to generating the web session model. In operation 170, the web session
        events are extracted from the session archive database for the modeling time
        period. The session archive may be open to any source of data, including flat
        files. In one example, a Microsoft.RTM. SQL database may be used, and an Open
        Database Connectivity (ODBC) may be used for connection to the database.<br
        />(47)  In operation 172, the number of occurrences for each web session event
        may be accumulated for sub-portions of the configurable historical time period.
        For example, the number of occurrences for each web session event may be aggregated
        for each hour over a last month of captured historical data. The aggregated
        web session events may be assigned associated timestamps and listed in a table.
        The number of occurrences for the web session events may be counted by the
        monitoring system prior to the aggregated web session events being processed
        by the analysis system.<br />(48)  In operation 174, the count values for
        the web session events may be reshaped into a wide table so that every row
        represents a certain timestamp and every column represents a certain event.
        Web session events are represented in the columns of the wide table with a
        unique code (UNIQUEID-coded event variable).<br />(49)  In operation 176,
        the web session events may be filtered. For example, there may be no occurrences
        of certain web session events for certain one hour periods. A non-occurrence
        is alternatively referred to as a Not Applicable (NA). Web session events
        that only rarely happen might be filtered from the wide table in operation
        176. For example, any web session events that have more than X % of NA values
        may be removed from the wide table. The X % value may be a selectable value
        specified in the configuration file 135 in FIG. 1 and in one example may have
        a default value of X=50%. The rationale for this is that a model is created
        of normal behavior, not exceptional behavior. Events that are rare but important
        can be monitored by the operator on an individual basis. All remaining NA
        values after these operations are replaced with zeroes, representing zero
        occurrences of corresponding events.<br />(50)  In operation 178, some web
        session events may be removed from web session model generation, monitoring
        and/or alerting. For example one of the web session events may be caused by
        an attempt to redeem cash bonus with not enough credits. This event might
        be fired at abnormal count levels as a result of an ad-hoc marketing campaign.
        A large number of these events may cause the web session model to produce
        unnecessary alarms. To avoid annoying alarms the user can temporarily add
        the event to the blacklist.<br />(51)  If created during a historical period
        that overlaps with the marketing campaign, the web session model may be too
        lousy and allow too many outliers to pass unnoticed. In either case, the operator
        may black-list the web session event to prevent the model from identifying
        outliers that are usually associated with normal web session operations. The
        remaining web session events may be used in operation 180 to generate the
        web session model.<br />(52)  In operation 182, duplicate web session events
        may be identified. For example, some web session events may have different
        unique identifiers but may represent the same web session event. For example,
        two different divisions in an enterprise may have created two different events
        for capturing the same web session data. The identified web session events
        may be identified during creation of the web session model and displayed to
        the operator in operation 182. The operator may reconfigure the monitoring
        system so that one of the duplicate events is no longer captured and stored
        in the session archive. This may reduce the amount of processing for capturing,
        storing, and analyzing duplicate web session events.<br />(53)  FIG. 4A depicts
        an example of a first table 190 identifying occurrences of web session events
        for a particular one hour time period as it looks after extraction from the
        database. In this example, column 192 identifies hour-long time periods. Column
        194 lists the unique identifiers associated with each of the different web
        session events. Column 196 lists the number of occurrences for each of the
        different web session events for the hour-long time period identified in column
        190.<br />(54)  FIG. 4B depicts an example of a second wide table 200 listing
        all the web session events for the entire historical modeling period after
        the data reshaping process 174. For example, row 202 may list the number of
        occurrences for each of the different web session events for a first one hour
        time period starting at 7:00 pm on Oct. 29, 2011 as previously shown in table
        190 of FIG. 4A. Column 204 lists all of the individual one hour time periods
        during the historical modeling period that in one example may be one month.
        Column 206 lists the number of occurrences for each of the web session events
        for each of the one hour time periods listed in column 204.<br />(55)  For
        example, the web session event assigned unique identifier V.1 had 284,262
        occurrences during the one hour time period starting at 2:00 am on Oct. 30,
        2011. In another example, the web session event assigned unique identifier
        V.22 had zero occurrences during the one hour time periods starting at 11:00
        pm on Oct. 29, 2011; 3:00 am on Oct. 30, 2011; and 5:00 am on Oct. 30, 2011.
        Web session event V.22 has few NA''s during the period displayed on FIG. 4B,
        but still passed through the sparsity filter and is included in data modeling
        and monitoring process.<br />(56)  FIG. 5 depicts an example of a process
        for generating the web session model. In operation 220, the number of occurrences
        of the web session events may be normalized. As explained above, the web session
        model may represent a normal web session behavior. For different web session
        events a normal range or occurrences may be different. For example, a normal
        average number of occurrences for a first web session event per hour may be
        10,000 and a normal average number of occurrences for a second web session
        event per hour may be 5. Thus, the event counts may be normalized in operation
        220 to be centered at mean and ranged to fall between 0 and 1.<br />(57)  In
        operation 222, a covariance matrix may be calculated for the normalized occurrences
        of the web session events and in operation 224 eigenvectors may be calculated
        from the covariance matrix. The eigenvectors of the covariance matrix provide
        the principle components for the web session model.<br />(58)  In operation
        226, a cross-validation is performed on the data. Cross-validation may consist
        of repeated exclusion of data for some of the timestamp periods (timestamp
        data) and calculation of a total variance ratio retained after application
        of the principal components to the remaining dataset. This procedure allows
        estimating a level of noise penetrated into the web session model which is
        opposite to the predictive power of the model. The cross-validation results
        may also be used to determine the optimal number of principal components for
        the model.<br />(59)  A number of principle components for the model are selected
        in operation 228. The number of principal components can be selected based
        on different criteria. For example, the number of principal components may
        be based on a retained variance ratio reaching a pre-defined amount, such
        as a default value of 85%. Alternatively, the number of principle components
        can be determined to maximize the predictive power of the model as revealed
        by the cross-validation process 226. Normalizing data, calculating a covariance
        matrix and eigenvectors, cross-validating data, and selecting principle components
        from the data are operations known to those skilled in data processing.<br
        />(60)  Some operations described below for generating a model may be manually
        performed using existing software systems and may be described in more detail
        in L. Eriksson, E. Johansson, N. Kettaneh-Wold, J. Trygg, C. Wikstroem, S.
        Wold &quot;Multi- and Megavariate Data Analysis&quot; 2006, Umetrics (Eriksson)
        which is herein incorporated by reference. To create a fully automated modeling
        component for the system, original software was developed to implement the
        described algorithms.<br />(61)  FIG. 6A depicts an example histogram for
        a pertained variance ratio 240 of the timestamp data. Pertained variance ratio
        240 grows steadily with each new principal component added to the web session
        model. Each principal component is a weighted linear combination of the web
        session events.<br />(62)  A second histogram represents a cross-validation
        242 and indicates a predictive power of the web session model. Noise in the
        data may reduce the relative pertained variance ratio. In one example, principal
        components may be calculated until the cross-validation ratio 242 reaches
        a pre-defined threshold portion of the pertained variance ratio. For example,
        principal components may be added until cross-validation ratio 242 reaches
        a default of 85% of the pertained variance ratio 240. This may indicate a
        threshold value where additional principal components may only add noise into
        the web session model and effectively decrease the predictive power of the
        model.<br />(63)  FIG. 6B depicts is a projection of the observations data
        onto the two-dimensional plane defined by the first two principal components
        from the web session model. Elements 244 represent timestamped web session
        event observations and an ellipse 243 represents the statistical confidence
        ellipsoid as projected onto the same plane. A default confidence level may
        be 95%, meaning that all the observation points outside the ellipsoid represent
        statistically abnormal activity with 95% confidence level. Any elements 244
        located outside of ellipse 243 may therefore be investigated further as possible
        outliers.<br />(64)  In practice, outlier detection is performed not on the
        projection plane like shown on FIG. 6B, but in the whole principal components
        space. Two formulas may be used for generating thresholds in multivariate
        principal component space for the outlier detection.<br />(65)  A first model
        is based on the notion of Hotelling T.sup.2 distance in the model space. Let
        us denote the total number of model principal components as A and the total
        number of the time-stamped web events observations in the wide table as N.
        The Hotelling T.sup.2 distance for the i-th observation is defined as:<br
        />(66)  .times..times. ##EQU00001##  where t.sub.a is the model scores vector
        and s.sub.ia.sup.2 is the variance of t.sub.a. It is described in Eriksson
        et al. that T.sub.i.sup.2N(N-A)/A(N.sup.2-1) satisfies F-distribution with
        A and (N-A) degrees of freedom. Therefore, the threshold for the outlier detection
        with 95% confidence level may be calculated as: T.sub.threshold=A(N.sup.2-1)/N(N-A)F.sub.critical(p=0.05)<br
        />(67)  The second criterion is based on the notion of distance to model.
        If K denotes the total number of web events included into the model, then
        normalized distance to the model for the i-th observation is defined as:<br
        />(68)   ##EQU00002## .times..times. ##EQU00002.2## .times. ##EQU00002.3##  where
        E={e.sub.ij} is the residual matrix for the model. The threshold value for
        DmodX may be determined based on the fact that s.sub.i.sup.2/s.sub.0.sup.2
        satisfies F-distribution with the degrees of freedom of observations and the
        model.<br />(69)  FIG. 7A depicts a visual representation of the Hotelling
        T.sup.2 model identifying distances of elements 246 inside of a model space
        with the optimum number of principal components identified in FIG. 6A. Ellipsoid
        250 represents the model boundary as defined by the threshold of the Hotelling
        T.sup.2 distance. FIG. 7B depicts a visual representation of the DmodX model
        that identifies distances of elements 246 to the model space. The plane DC2
        in FIG. 7B represents an A-dimensional principal components sub-space in K-dimensional
        space of observations. Each plane DC1 and DC3 represents the DmodX thresholds
        around the model space that is used to detect the outliers by the distance-to-model
        method.<br />(70)  Elements 246 in the two model spaces of FIGS. 7A and 7B
        represent timestamp data observations and the timestamp data observations
        represent the set of web session events for the given timestamp period, such
        as a one hour time period. Observation 248 may be identified as an outlier
        when an associated distance extends beyond threshold 250 for the Hotelling
        T.sup.2 in FIG. 7A or beyond a threshold associated with the DmodX model in
        FIG. 7B. The thresholds multipliers may be specified by the user in the configuration
        file 135 in FIG. 1. The threshold multipliers may be used to control the volume
        of outlier notifications, if needed.<br />(71)  FIG. 8A depicts an example
        of a chart 260 having a y-axis identifying the different timestamps and a
        x-axis identifying the Hotelling T.sup.2 distances of the timestamps for the
        model shown in FIG. 7A. A second chart (not shown) may identify the timestamps
        and the distances of the timestamps to the model space for the DmodX model
        shown in FIG. 7B in the same manner. A threshold 264 in chart 260 represents
        the boundary for the Hotelling T.sup.2 model. A timestamp outlier 266 may
        be any point above the statistical threshold 264 defined for the Hotelling
        T.sup.2 model. Several consecutive outlying timestamps 262 may be considered
        as one outlier with a duration of several hours. In the case of a prolonged
        outlier, the timestamp with the maximum distance may be used for the most
        significant contributors analysis described below.<br />(72)  FIG. 8B depicts
        an example of a contribution chart 270 showing the relative contribution of
        the different web session events to the timestamp outlier 266 shown in FIG.
        8A. The x-axis in chart 270 represents the different web session events and
        the y-axis represents the normalized contributions of the different web session
        events to timestamp outlier 266 in FIG. 8A. For example, chart 270 may identify
        the weighted contribution of each of the web session events to the one hour
        timestamp outlier 266. As shown in FIG. 8B, a web session event V60 has a
        largest contribution and a web session event V1242 has a second large contribution.<br
        />(73)  FIG. 8C depicts a chart 280 also showing the contribution of the web
        session events to timestamp outlier 266 in FIG. 8A. In this example, the y-axis
        identifies the web session events and the x-axis identifies the different
        web session events in decreasing order of contribution to outlier 266. The
        most significant contributors to the outlier that exceed the pre-defined number
        of standard deviations above the mean for the chart 280 are referred to as
        top contributors. If there are no such events, the maximum contributor may
        be considered a single top mover.<br />(74)  FIG. 8D depicts an example of
        a table 290 showing the top contributing web session events 292 for timestamp
        outlier 266 in FIG. 8A. The web session events 292 may be listed in table
        290 in order of contribution amount to the Hotelling T.sup.2 distance of outlier
        266 and may represent web session events that have the most influence in causing
        the web sessions to operate outside of normal operating conditions. Web session
        event V.60 was identified as having the most significant contribution to outlier
        266 in FIG. 8A and web session event V.1242 was identified as having the second
        most significant contribution to outlier 266.<br />(75)  For example, the
        most significant web session event V.60 may be associated with an error message
        indicating a rental car fare was not found, the second most significant web
        session event V.1242 may be associated with an error message requesting a
        user to select a pick-up time, a third most signification event may be associated
        with an error message requesting a user to select a drop-off time; and a fourth
        most signification event may indicate a user has been connected to the web
        application beyond some define time period.<br />(76)  FIG. 8E depicts an
        example of a chart 294 plotting one of the most significant web session events
        V.186 contributing to the timestamp outlier 266 in FIG. 8A. Classic univariate
        Shewart control charts may be calculated for the most significant web session
        events. Univariate control charts may be calculated for already found outliers
        and only for demonstration purposes. This is one primary difference between
        multivariate modeling and traditional univariate control: outliers are found
        by multivariate modeling and charts may only be performed on the reporting
        stage. The time and number of occurrences 296 of web session event V.186 associated
        with timestamp outlier 266 may be marked with a red box. Additional charts
        can be plotted for the other significant contributors 292 and the timestamps
        and number of occurrences associated with the timestamp outlier 266 may be
        marked similarly to event V186.<br />(77)  FIG. 9 summarizes operations for
        identifying the most significant contributors for timestamp outliers. In operation
        300, outliers are identified by the multivariate web session modeling. In
        operation 302, contributions of the web session events to the timestamp outliers
        are calculated. In operation 304, the most significant web session event contributors
        are identified as shown in FIG. 8C. In operation 306, the most significant
        web session events may be plotted in charts identifying the time and number
        of occurrences of the web session events associated with the timestamp outliers.<br
        />(78)  FIG. 10 depicts an example of the second module of the system that
        provides the real-time monitoring of web sessions using the previously created
        multivariate model of normal web session activity. In operation 348, the multivariate
        model previously saved by the first module, is imported into the second module.
        In operation 350, the analysis system extracts web session events from the
        session archive database in the same manner previously described above for
        generating the web session model. However, the web session events may only
        be for a current monitoring time period and not the entire historical time
        period. For example, instead of using a month of web session events for generating
        the model, only a last hour of web session events may be extracted from the
        session database.<br />(79)  In operation 352, the extracted web session events
        are processed in a same manner as described above where the first module generates
        the web session model. For example, occurrences for the last hour of web session
        events may be reshaped to produce a single-row matrix that is normalized,
        filtered, and transformed using the model parameters. In operation 354, the
        processed web session events are applied to the web session model. Application
        of the saved parameters ensures that the newly extracted web session data
        is processed by exactly the same method that was applied for the model creation.<br
        />(80)  In operation 356, the two indicative distances to the model may be
        calculated for the timestamp element in the model space. For example, the
        Hotelling T2 and DmodX distances to the model may be calculated for the timestamp
        representing the one hour monitoring period and then compared to the restored
        thresholds. The timestamp may be identified as an outlier if the distance
        is outside of the threshold for either distance to the model. In operation
        358, a report may be generated identifying the most significant web session
        events contributors to the timestamp element.<br />(81)  The outlier notification
        process is controlled by the parameters stored into the configuration file
        135 on FIG. 1. This file contains, among others, the email server configuration
        and email addresses of the persons responsible for the outlier notification
        response. The configuration file may also contain verbosity parameter that
        controls the level of notification that should be applied to the system. The
        current timestamp may be or may not be an outlier. In operation 358, the analysis
        system still may list the most significant N movers in a report and plot the
        most significant web session events in graphs. If the timestamp element is
        not an outlier in operation 360, the graphs identifying the top movers may
        be displayed in a first color. If the verbosity parameter is equal to 2 (high),
        an informational email may be sent to the addressees identified in the configuration
        file. If the timestamp is identified as an outlier in operation 360, the graphs
        identifying the top movers may be displayed in a second color and an alert
        message may be sent to the correspondent email addressees in operation 362.
        For example, the reports and graphs may be emailed to marketing personnel
        when no outliers are identified and the reports may also be emailed to IT
        personnel and management personnel when outliers are identified.<br />(82)  Thus,
        the analysis system identifies the web session events having a highest impact
        in causing abnormal web session operations. Less significant web session events
        may not be periodically monitored and/or reported. As explained above, some
        of the events may be excluded from the reports if the operator knows those
        events are known to create abnormal system operating conditions, such as a
        one day promotion.<br />(83)  The modeling and monitoring modules can be operated
        automatically as autonomous scripts. In one example, the scripts may be scheduled
        to automatically run approximately half of the historical modeling period
        used for creating the model. For example, if web session events are retained
        for one month, the web session model may be automatically refreshed every
        2-3 weeks. The monitoring periods also may be programmed to automatically
        generate reports for programmable time periods, such as for each hour of captured
        web session events. Any other indicators of model deviation can be used to
        update the model. For example, the model may be automatically updated after
        unusual web session activities, such as after a marketing promotion or after
        a holiday.<br />(84)  FIG. 11 depicts one example of how significant user
        interface events may be identified. A group of user interface events 380 may
        be captured for a historical model generation period or for a more frequent
        monitoring period. User interface events may include selecting a buy button
        icon 380A, clicking on a link #1 380B, entering characters into a field #5
        380C, selecting a product checkout icon button 380D, and clicking on a link
        #6 380E. These are of course just examples of any user interface events that
        may be captured during the web sessions.<br />(85)  The number of occurrences
        for each of user interface events 380 is counted and the occurrences processed
        as described above. The processed user interface events may be used to generate
        web session activity model 382 and/or may be applied to an existing web session
        model 382. A timestamp data point distance for user interface events 380 is
        identified and the significance of user interface events 380 to the derived
        distance are determined as explained above. The timestamp data observation
        may or may not be identified as an outlier.<br />(86)  A report 384 may be
        generated listing the user interface events 380 in order of their significance
        to the timestamp observation distance to the model. For example, user interface
        event 380C may have been identified as having a most significant influence
        to the timestamp. The occurrences of user interface event 380A may have been
        identified as having a second most significant influence to the timestamp
        and occurrences of user interface event 380F for selecting a product tab may
        have been identified as having a third most significant influence. If the
        timestamp observation is identified as an outlier, an alert may be sent along
        with report 384.<br />(87)  The most significant user inter interface events
        380 may provide information on which user interface events are most likely
        to cause abnormal web session operations or may identify user interface events
        that are most difficult for users to successfully complete for normal web
        session operations. For example, the most significant user interface events
        380 may be associated with web sessions that did not result in online purchases.
        Results of reports 384 may be used for customer experience segmentation. For
        example, user interface events associated with particular web browsers may
        be segmented and analyzed to determine if user operating errors may be associated
        with particular web session environments.<br />(88)  Other operations may
        be initiated based on report 384. For example, a portion of the web session
        associated with an outlier may be replayed. At least some of the network data
        associated with the outlier may be synchronized with replaying at least some
        of the user interface events associated with the outlier in substantially
        a same order as previously occurring during the web sessions. Replay may provide
        additional information regarding why the web session operated outside of normal
        operating boundaries. Capturing and replaying web session events are described
        in U.S. Pat. No. RE41903 and U.S. Pat. No. 8,127,000 which have both been
        herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br />(89)  The system
        and apparatus described above may use dedicated processor systems, micro controllers,
        programmable logic devices, microprocessors, or any combination thereof, to
        perform some or all of the operations described herein. Some of the operations
        described above may be implemented in software and other operations may be
        implemented in hardware. One or more of the operations, processes, and/or
        methods described herein may be performed by an apparatus, a device, and/or
        a system substantially similar to those as described herein and with reference
        to the illustrated figures.<br />(90)  The processing device may execute instructions
        or &quot;code&quot; stored in memory. The memory may store data as well. The
        processing device may include, but may not be limited to, an analog processor,
        a digital processor, a microprocessor, a multi-core processor, a processor
        array, a network processor, or the like. The processing device may be part
        of an integrated control system or system manager, or may be provided as a
        portable electronic device configured to interface with a networked system
        either locally or remotely via wireless transmission.<br />(91)  The processor
        memory may be integrated together with the processing device, for example
        RAM or FLASH memory disposed within an integrated circuit microprocessor or
        the like. In other examples, the memory may comprise an independent device,
        such as an external disk drive, a storage array, a portable FLASH key fob,
        or the like. The memory and processing device may be operatively coupled together,
        or in communication with each other, for example by an I/O port, a network
        connection, or the like, and the processing device may read a file stored
        on the memory. Associated memory may be &quot;read only&quot; by design (ROM)
        by virtue of permission settings, or not. Other examples of memory may include,
        but may not be limited to, WORM, EPROM, EEPROM, FLASH, or the like, which
        may be implemented in solid state semiconductor devices. Other memories may
        comprise moving parts, such as a conventional rotating disk drive. All such
        memories may be &quot;machine-readable&quot; and may be readable by a processing
        device.<br />(92)  Operating instructions or commands may be implemented or
        embodied in tangible forms of stored computer software (also known as &quot;computer
        program&quot; or &quot;code&quot;). Programs, or code, may be stored in a
        digital memory and may be read by the processing device. &quot;Computer-readable
        storage medium&quot; (or alternatively, &quot;machine-readable storage medium&quot;)
        may include all of the foregoing types of memory, as well as new technologies
        of the future, as long as the memory may be capable of storing digital information
        in the nature of a computer program or other data, at least temporarily, and
        as long at the stored information may be &quot;read&quot; by an appropriate
        processing device. The term &quot;computer-readable&quot; may not be limited
        to the historical usage of &quot;computer&quot; to imply a complete mainframe,
        mini-computer, desktop or even laptop computer. Rather, &quot;computer-readable&quot;
        may comprise storage medium that may be readable by a processor, a processing
        device, or any computing system. Such media may be any available media that
        may be locally and/or remotely accessible by a computer or a processor, and
        may include volatile and non-volatile media, and removable and non-removable
        media, or any combination thereof.<br />(93)  A program stored in a computer-readable
        storage medium may comprise a computer program product. For example, a storage
        medium may be used as a convenient means to store or transport a computer
        program. For the sake of convenience, the operations may be described as various
        interconnected or coupled functional blocks or diagrams. However, there may
        be cases where these functional blocks or diagrams may be equivalently aggregated
        into a single logic device, program or operation with unclear boundaries.<br
        />(94)  Having described and illustrated the principles of various examples,
        it should be apparent that the examples may be modified in arrangement and
        detail without departing from such principles. We claim all modifications
        and variation coming within the spirit and scope of the following claims.","claimsHtml":"1.
