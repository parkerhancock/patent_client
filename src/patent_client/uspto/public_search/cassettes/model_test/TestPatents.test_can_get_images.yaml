      present invention provides a multilayered wafer 10 such as an SOI wafer having
      a novel implanted layer. This implanted layer is removable and provides a resulting
      wafer having a substantially uniform surface. The wafer includes a bulk substrate
      11 and an insulating layer 13 formed overlying the bulk substrate 15. A film
      of semiconductor material is formed overlying the insulating layer. Surface
      non-uniformities are formed overlying and in the film of semiconductor material.
      The non-uniformities are implanted, and are bordered by a substantially uniform
      interface 17 at a selected depth underlying the surface non-uniformities. The
      substantially uniform interface provides a substantially uniform resulting surface
      for the SOI wafer.","descriptionHtml":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br
      />FIG. 1 is a simplified cross-sectional view diagram of an SOI wafer having
      a non-uniform surface; and<br />FIGS. 2-7 are simplified cross-sectional view
      diagrams of the above SOI wafer according to the present invention.<br />(1)
      DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS<br />(2) According to the present invention,
      a technique including a method and device for removing surface non-uniformities
      on a surface(s) of a substrate such as an SOI wafer is provided. In exemplary
      embodiments, the technique also removes impurities from the bulk material of
      the SOI wafer, as well as removing surface roughness and non-uniformities. More
      particularly, the invention uses an implanting technique, which causes implant
      damage to a thickness of material having surface &quot;roughness,&quot; where
      the thickness of material is later selectively removed, thereby leaving a substantially
      uniform surface on the SOI wafer. The SOI wafer is made by way of a variety
      of techniques including a &quot;blister&quot; process such as Smart Cut.sup..TM.  or
      preferably a controlled cleaving process.<br />(3) FIG. 1 is a simplified cross-sectional
      view diagram of a partially completed SOI wafer 10 having an implanted material
      region according to the present invention. This diagram is merely an illustration
      and should not limit the scope of the claims herein. One of ordinary skill in
      the art would recognize other modifications, alternatives, and variations.<br
      />(4) The SOI wafer 10 is a partially completed wafer, which has a novel implanted
      layer 21. Among other elements, the SOI wafer includes a bulk substrate 11,
      which can be made of a variety of materials such as silicon, glass, and others.
      Overlying the bulk substrate 11 is an insulating layer 13, which is often made
      of oxide, but can also be other materials such as silicon nitride, multi-layered
      materials, and the like. A film of semiconductor material 15 (e.g., single crystal
      silicon) overlies the insulating layer 13.<br />(5) The semiconductor material
      15 includes an implanted layer 21, which can have a lower material density than
      the bulk of the semiconductor material 15. As shown, the implanted layer includes
      an interface region defined by the dotted line and shown by reference numeral
      17. This interface region is a substantially uniform plane relative to the bulk
      of semiconductor material. Additionally, average density of the region overlying
      the interface region shown by reference numeral 17 is less than average density
      of the material in the bulk region 15. By way of different properties of layer
      21 and layer 15, layer 21 can be selectively removed by way of a variety of
      semiconductor processing techniques such as etching, and others. In a specific
      embodiment, the implanted layer 21 is oxidized into a silicon dioxide layer,
      but can be converted to other materials. By removing the implanted layer 21
      having non-uniformities, a fully planarized and substantially uniform substrate
      surface 17 can be made according to the present invention.<br />(6) In preferred
      embodiments, the implanted layer can also remove impurities by way of a gettering
      action from the bulk semiconductor material region 15, as well as other regions.
      These impurities include, among others, metals such as copper, nickel, silver,
      gold, or iron, and other mobile particles, which migrate within the semiconductor
      material region 15. With enhanced diffusion at elevated temperatures, impurities
      are trapped in the implanted layer by way of the rough or implanted structure.
      Alternatively, the type of material of the implanted layer attracts and holds
      impurities into the layer. The implanted layer therefore acts as a gettering
      layer for impurities, which become trapped in the implanted layer. These impurities
      can be eliminated by removing the implanted layer from the semiconductor material
      by way of selective etching and other fabrication techniques. Details of these
      fabrication techniques for this partially completed substrate, as well as completed
      fully planarized substrates are discussed below.<br />(7) FIGS. 2-7 are simplified
      diagrams of a method for fabricating the above SOI wafer according to the present
      invention. These diagrams are merely illustrations and should not limit the
      scope of the claims herein. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize
      other modifications, alternatives, and variations. The present invention provides
      a novel implanted layer, which can be removed, thereby leaving a substantially
      uniform SOI wafer, as well as eliminate impurities from active regions subsequently
      formed in the SOI wafer.<br />(8) A variety of techniques can be used to form
      the implanted layer and rough surface on the SOI wafer, for example. FIG. 2
      shows a simplified illustration of a cleaving or cut process, which effectively
      removes a portion 201 of a donor wafer from a thin film of detached material
      15. Depending upon the type of cleaving or cut process, surface 205 can be relatively
      non-uniform and have imperfections thereon, as shown. For example, donor substrate
      portion 201 is removed by way of a blister technique commonly termed Smart Cut.TM..
      An example of this blister technique for removing film material 15 from donor
      substrate portion 201 is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,374,564, entitled, Process
      For The Production Of Thin Semiconductor Material Films, by Michel Bruel, issued
      Dec. 20, 1994 (the &quot;Bruel&quot; patent). The Bruel patent generally describes
      a process for globally raising the temperature of an implanted wafer to blister
      a film off of a wafer by way of expanding microbubbles. This technique can often
      form non-uniformities 205 or surface roughness and imperfections in the wafer
      surface, as shown. Additionally, the blister process produces a non-uniform
      layer, which has lateral and vertical roughness or non-uniformities. The non-uniformities
      must be removed before beginning the fabrication of active integrated circuit
      devices in the SOI wafer. The blister process forms implant damaged layer 203,
      which has a substantially uniform interface region 17. This uniform interface
      region is formed by way of the vertical straggle of the ion implant process
      used for a Smart Cut.TM..<br />(9) In an alternative specific embodiment, an
      implanted layer 303 including the surface roughness can be made by way of a
      controlled cleaving process. This process allows an initiation of a cleaving
      process on a substrate using a single or multiple cleave region(s) through the
      use of controlled energy (e.g., spatial distribution) and selected conditions
      to allow an initiation of a cleave front(s) and to allow it to propagate through
      the substrate to remove a thin film of material 15 from the substrate. The process
      is described in Henley et al, entitled A CONTROLLED CLEAVAGE PROCESS AND RESULTING
      DEVICE, filed May 12, 1997 (&quot;Henley&quot;) (Attorney Docket No. 18419-000100)
      and hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes. The controlled cleaving
      process provides a more uniform surface on the film as compared to the blister
      method described by Bruel, noted above. Additionally, the controlled cleaving
      process produces a uniform layer, which has limited lateral roughness that can
      be removed using the present technique. The controlled cleaving process also
      forms implant damaged layer 203, which has a substantially uniform interface
      region 17. This uniform interface region is formed by way of the straggle of
      the ion implant or plasma immersion implant process used for the controlled
      cleaving process.<br />(10) In still a further alternative embodiment, the implanted
      layer having the non-uniform surface is made by lower energy implantation of
      a non-uniform film, as shown by FIG. 3. As shown, a substrate 300, which includes
      the film of material 15, includes surface roughness or non-uniformities 305.
      Energetic impurities or particles 301 can be introduced into the film of material
      15 using one of numerous techniques. These techniques include beam line ion
      implantation, plasma immersion ion implantation, and others. The energetic particles
      cause implant damage to the film of material 303 having the surface non-uniformities
      305. As merely an example, the energetic particles include, among other materials,
      charged (positive or negative) and/or neutral atoms or molecules, or electrons,
      or the like. In a specific embodiment, the particles can be neutral and/or charged
      particles including ions such as H+ ions, rare gas ions such as helium and its
      isotopes, and neon, and deuterium. The particles can also be derived from compounds
      such as gases, e.g., hydrogen gas, water vapor, methane, hydrides, and hydrogen
      compounds, and other atomic mass particles. Alternatively, the particles can
      be any combination of the above particles, and/or ions and/or molecular species
      and/or atomic species. The particles generally have sufficient kinetic energy
      to enter into material 15 to create the implanted layer 303 having a substantially
      uniform interface 17. The substantially uniform interface is enhanced when the
      lateral straggle of the implant is greater than the characteristic size of the
      surface roughness.<br />(11) FIG. 3A is a more detailed diagram of FIG. 3 (or
      a detailed diagram similar to FIG. 2). This diagram is merely an illustration
      and should not limit the scope of the claims herein. One of ordinary skill in
      the art would recognize other variations, alternatives, and modifications. As
      shown, the implanted layer 303 includes the interface 17 at (z.sub.i), which
      is substantially uniform from the vertical straggle and the lateral straggle
      of the implant. The surface roughness 305 has an outer region defined at (z.sub.n)
      and an inner region defined by (z.sub.l). In most embodiments, the distance
      (defined by reference letter A) between the outer region and the inner region
      is less than the distance (defined by reference letter B) between the outer
      region and the interface. In a specific embodiment, the distance B is at least
      1.0 or 1.5 times the distance A. Alternatively, the distance B is at least 2
      times the distance A. Alternatively, the distance B is at least 3 times the
      distance of A. Of course, the particular relative distances will depend upon
      the application. An explanation of implant straggle is explained in, for example,
      C. J. John Peng and N. W. Cheung, &quot;Two Dimensional Implantation Profile
      Simulator--RETRO,&quot; Nuclear Instrum. Methods, Vol. B74, pp. 222-225 (1993),
      which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br />(12) After forming a film (e.g.,
      303) having implanted surface non-uniformities such as anyone of the above SOI
      substrates, the material comprising the implanted surface non-uniformities is
      converted into another material, as illustrated by FIG. 4, for example. That
      is, the implanted surface non-uniformities made by silicon can be converted
      into silicon dioxide by way of an oxidation process. Oxidation occurs in a thermal
      annealing furnace using either oxygen or steam. Thermal annealing converts the
      implanted surface non-uniformities made of silicon into silicon dioxide. As
      shown, the surface includes non-uniformities 19 (or reference number 305 or
      205) in the layer of silicon dioxide 21. A substantially uniform interface 17
      is defined between the silicon dioxide 21 and silicon substrate material 15.
      The substantially uniform interface generally has a uniformity less than about
      0.5% or more preferably less than about 0.3%.<br />(13) In order to better understand
      this technique of forming this substantially uniform interface 17, it may be
      helpful to describe the oxidation of silicon process in more detail using FIGS.
      5 and 6. FIG. 5 is a more detailed diagram of FIG. 4, and FIG. 6 is a diagram
      illustrating a density of the non-uniform implanted layer in silicon before
      oxidation. Referring to FIG. 5, for example, the SOI wafer includes, among other
      elements, the film of material 15, the interface 17, and the silicon dioxide
      layer 21, which includes the surface non-uniformities 19. The interface layer
      is defined along a horizontal plane at (z.sub.i) and the surface has an upper
      height at (z.sub.m). The lower height is defined by (z.sub.l). As shown, the
      silicon dioxide layer, which is previously silicon, converts into silicon dioxide,
      leaving a substantially uniform interface 17 in the silicon dioxide 21 layer,
      which is defined as the film of silicon 15.<br />(14) Before converting the
      silicon into silicon dioxide, the surface non-uniformities are implanted. By
      way of implanting, which causes implant damage, the density of the region having
      the non-uniformities is less than the density of the bulk silicon material.
      To illustrate the difference in densities between the implanted layer and the
      bulk silicon material, FIG. 6 is provided. As shown, the vertical axis represents
      the density of the materials, where .rho..sub.s represents the density of the
      bulk substrate and .rho..sub.t represents the density of the implanted layer.
      As shown, the density of the bulk substrate is greater than the density of the
      implanted layer. At the interface region (z.sub.i), the density of the substrate
      structure decreases to the density of the implanted layer until a lateral distance
      (z.sub.m), which is defined as the outer most point of the surface non-uniformities.
      This difference in densities allows oxygen molecules or ions to diffuse through
      and react with the implanted layer at a much faster rate than the diffusion
      of oxygen into the bulk silicon material. Since the diffusion or mass transfer
      rate of the oxygen is faster through the implanted layer, the oxygen converts
      substantially all of the silicon in the implanted layer into silicon dioxide
      before beginning to convert any of the silicon in the bulk substrate, which
      has a higher density. By way of limitations in mass transfer rates in the bulk
      silicon layer, oxidation of the bulk silicon layer essentially stops or slows
      down to a point where the interface 17 region forms in a substantially uniform
      manner.<br />(15) In a specific embodiment, the oxidized (or implanted) non-uniform
      layer also works as a gettering layer. For example, the non-uniform layer includes
      a surface roughness and an interface region, which can attract and trap impurities,
      that migrate in the subsequently formed active regions of the SOI wafer. Accordingly,
      the non-uniform layer can accumulate impurities such as metal contaminates from
      the active region. These impurities can be eliminated as the non-uniform layer
      is removed. This removal process is described in more detail below.<br />(16)
      Subsequent to oxidation of the non-uniform implanted layer, a selective removal
      process can be used to remove the non-uniform implanted layer from the bulk
      substrate 15, as shown in FIG. 7. For example, since the non-uniform implanted
      layer is made of oxide and the bulk substrate is made of silicon, a selective
      etchant can be used to selectively remove the oxide from the bulk silicon substrate.
      As merely an example, the selective etchant can include a variety of solutions
      such as hydrofluoric acid or the like, if a wet process is desired. Alternatively,
      the oxide can be selectively removed by way of a plasma etching or reactive
      ion etching or a plasma immersion process. Using a plasma process, an etchant
      includes, among other materials, a fluorine bearing compound(s), e.g., CF.sub.4,
      SF.sub.6. Of course, the type of etchant used will depend upon the<br />(17)  application.<br
      />(18) The etching process selectively removes the non-uniformities from the
      material region to leave a substantially uniform surface 701, for example. This
      substantially uniform surface has a surface uniformity less than about 0.5%,
      or less than about 0.3% and lower, if needed. Preferably, the selective removal
      process is used with the controlled cleaving process, which generally provides
      a detached surface that is more uniform than those made by way of the blister
      technique such as Smart Cut.TM. and others.<br />(19) In an alternative embodiment,
      a final polishing step can be performed before using the wafer for integrated
      circuit processing. For example, the detached surface of the film of silicon
      material can be slightly rough and may need finishing, which occurs using a
      combination of grinding and/or polishing techniques. In some embodiments, the
      detached surface undergoes a step of grinding using, for examples, techniques
      such as rotating an abrasive material overlying the detached surface to remove
      any imperfections or surface roughness therefrom. A machine such as a &quot;back
      grinder&quot; made by a company called Disco may provide this technique.<br
      />(20) Alternatively, chemical mechanical polishing or planarization techniques
      finish the detached surface of the film. In CMP, a slurry mixture is applied
      directly to a polishing surface which is attached to a rotating platen. This
      slurry mixture can be transferred to the polishing surface by way of a metering
      pump, which is coupled to a slurry source. The slurry is often a solution containing
      an abrasive and an oxidizer, e.g., H.sub.2 O.sub.2, KIO.sub.3, ferric nitrate.
      The abrasive is often a borosilicate glass, titanium dioxide, titanium nitride,
      aluminum oxide, aluminum trioxide, iron nitrate, cerium oxide, silicon dioxide
      (colloidal silica), silicon nitride, silicon carbide, graphite, diamond, and
      any mixtures thereof. This abrasive is mixed in a solution of deionized water
      and oxidizer or the like. Preferably, the solution is acidic. Of course, the
      technique used to completely finish the surface of the wafer depends upon the
      application.<br />(21) While the above is a full description of the specific
      embodiments, various modifications, alternative constructions and equivalents
      may be used. Therefore, the above description and illustrations should not be
      taken as limiting the scope of the present invention which is defined by the

      The present invention relates to the manufacture of integrated circuits. More
      particularly, the present invention provides a technique for planarizing substrates
      using a novel implanting technique. This invention is illustrated using, for
      example, silicon-on-insulator wafers, but can be applied to other types of substrates.<br
      />(3) Integrated circuits are fabricated on chips of semiconductor material.
      These integrated circuits often contain thousands, or even millions, of transistors
      and other devices. In particular, it is desirable to put as many transistors
      as possible within a given area of semiconductor because more transistors typically
      provide greater functionality, and a smaller chip means more chips per wafer
      and lower costs.<br />(4) Some integrated circuits are fabricated on a slice
      or wafer, of single-crystal (monocrystalline) silicon, commonly termed a &quot;bulk&quot;
      silicon wafer. Devices on such &quot;bulk&quot; silicon wafer typically are
      isolated from each other. A variety of techniques have been proposed or used
      to isolate these devices from each other on the bulk silicon wafer, such as
      a local oxidation of silicon (&quot;LOCOS&quot;) process, trench isolation,
      and others. These techniques, however, are not free from limitations. For example,
      conventional isolation techniques consume a considerable amount of valuable
      wafer surface area on the chip, and often generate a non-planar surface as an
      artifact of the isolation process. Either or both of these considerations generally
      limit the degree of integration achievable in a given chip. Additionally, trench
      isolation often requires a process of reactive ion etching, which is extremely
      time consuming and can be difficult to achieve accurately.<br />(5) An approach
      to achieving very-large scale integration (&quot;VLSI&quot;) or ultra-large
      scale integration (&quot;ULSI&quot;) is by using a semiconductor-on-insulator
      (&quot;SOI&quot;) wafer. An SOI wafer typically has a layer of silicon on top
      of a layer of an insulator material. A variety of techniques have been proposed
      or used for fabricating the SOI wafer. These techniques include, among others,
      growing a thin layer of silicon on a sapphire substrate, bonding a layer of
      silicon to an insulating substrate, and forming an insulating layer beneath
      a silicon layer in a bulk silicon wafer. In an SOI integrated circuit, essentially
      complete device isolation is often achieved using conventional device processing
      methods by surrounding each device, including the bottom of the device, with
      an insulator. An advantage SOI wafers have over bulk silicon wafers is that
      the area required for isolation between devices on an SOI wafer is less than
      the area typically required for isolation on a bulk silicon wafer.<br />(6)
      SOI offers other advantages over bulk silicon technologies as well. For example,
      SOI offers a simpler fabrication sequence compared to a bulk silicon wafer.
      Devices fabricated on an SOI wafer may also have better radiation resistance,
      less photo-induced current, and less cross-talk than devices fabricated on bulk
      silicon wafers. Many problems, however, that have already been solved regarding
      fabricating devices on bulk silicon wafers remain to be solved for fabricating
      devices on SOI wafers.<br />(7) Numerous limitations still exist with the use
      of SOI wafers for the fabrication of integrated circuits. For example, devices
      within integrated circuits in SOI wafers are very sensitive to the presence
      of even minute concentrations of some impurities. For example, metals, such
      as copper, nickel, silver, gold, or iron, within the active region of a device
      typically degrade several device characteristics, including leakage current
      and breakdown voltage. These and other metals rapidly diffuse through silicon
      at temperatures typical of semiconductor device fabrication processes. These
      impurities often become trapped in the active region of the SOI wafer. That
      is, the SOI wafer includes a dielectric layer or insulating layer underlying
      the active region that tends to keep impurities in the active layer, rather
      than diffusing down into the bulk silicon. Accordingly, SOI wafers are prone
      to device and reliability problems caused by the presence of impurities that
      cannot diffuse out of the active region.<br />(8) SOI wafers generally must
      also be polished to remove any surface irregularities from the film of silicon
      overlying the insulating layer. Polishing generally includes, among others,
      chemical mechanical polishing, commonly termed CMP. CMP is generally time consuming
      and expensive, and can be difficult to perform cost efficiently to remove surface
      non-uniformities. That is, a CMP machine is expensive and requires large quantities
      of slurry mixture, which is also expensive.<br />(9) Furthermore, the film of
      silicon on the insulator layer is often polished by way of polishing techniques
      such as chemical mechanical polishing and others. Polishing is often required
      to clean the silicon surface and remove any non-uniformities therefrom. Polishing,
      however, is extremely time consuming and expensive. Polishing also introduces
      the wafer to a slurry mixture, which can be highly acidic or caustic. Accordingly,
      the slurry mixture can influence functionality and reliability of devices that
      are fabricated on the SOI wafer.<br />(10) From the above, it is seen that an
      improved technique for manufacturing a substrate such as an SOI wafer is highly
      desirable.<br />(11) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br />(12) According to the present
      invention, a technique including a method and device for removing surface non-uniformities
      and impurities from a substrate such as an SOI wafer is provided. In an exemplary
      embodiment, the technique uses a novel implanting step to provide an implanted
      layer with surface roughness that can be planarized. Planarization occurs by
      way of processing steps such as oxidation and selective removal of the non-uniform
      film.<br />(13) In a specific embodiment, the present invention provides a method
      for fabricating a substrate such as a silicon-on-insulator wafer using a novel
      implanting step, which enhances film uniformity. The method uses a step of providing
      a semiconductor substrate, which includes a thickness of material having a surface.
      The surface of the semiconductor substrate includes non-uniformities or &quot;roughness&quot;
      formed from, for example, a detachment process, that is, the non-uniformities
      can be made by way of a process such as a controlled cleaving process, or a
      process called Smart Cut.TM., or any others. The thickness of material has a
      volume defined by the surface and a selected depth, which has a substantially
      uniform surface at the selected depth. The thickness of material is also characterized
      by implant damage (e.g., structural, change in material property) which extends
      from the surface to the selected depth. The thickness of material is converted
      into an insulating material such as silicon dioxide at least up to the selected
      depth. The insulating material is selectively removed (e.g., wet or dry etching)
      from the semiconductor substrate to provide a substantially uniform surface
      overlying the semiconductor substrate.<br />(14) In an alternative specific
      embodiment, the present invention provides a substrate such as an SOI wafer
      having a novel implanted layer to provide a uniform surface on the wafer. The
      wafer includes a bulk substrate and an insulating layer formed overlying the
      bulk substrate. A film of semiconductor material is formed overlying the insulating
      layer. Surface non-uniformities (e.g., roughness) are formed overlying a thickness
      of material in the film. The thickness of material has a volume defined by a
      selected depth, which has a substantially uniform planar surface at that selected
      depth. The thickness of material is characterized by implant damage, which extends
      from the surface to the selected depth. This implant<br />(15)  damaged thickness
      of material can be removed by way of oxidation and selective etching techniques,
      thereby leaving a substantially uniform surface.<br />(16) In still a further
      embodiment, the present invention generally provides a method and resulting
      (and intermediary) structures for planarizing a substrate or film overlying
      the substrate (e.g., silicon wafer). The substrate or film includes a thickness
      of material having surface non-uniformities or roughness. Particles are implanted
      into the thickness of material through the surface non-uniformities to a selected
      depth, which has a substantially planar surface. The implanted thickness of
      material includes damage therein, e.g., structural or change in composition.
      The thickness of material is converted into another material such as an oxide
      layer, which can be selectively removed by processing techniques such as etching
      or the like. By way of selective removal of the implanted thickness of material,
      a substantially planar surface remains on the film of material or the substrate.<br
      />(17) Numerous benefits are achieved using the present invention over pre-existing
      techniques. For example, the present invention provides an efficient technique
      for forming a substantially uniform surface on an SOI wafer. Additionally, the
      substantially uniform surface is made by way of common oxidation and etching
      techniques. Furthermore, the present invention provides a novel non-uniform
      layer, which can act as a gettering layer for removing impurities from to be
      active regions of the SOI wafer. These and other benefits are described throughout
      the present specification and more particularly below.<br />(18) These and other
      embodiments of the present invention, as well as other advantages and features
      are described in more detail in conjunction with the text below and attached
