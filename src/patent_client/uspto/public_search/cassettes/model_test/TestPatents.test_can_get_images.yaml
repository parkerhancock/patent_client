        present invention provides a multilayered wafer 10 such as an SOI wafer having
        a novel implanted layer. This implanted layer is removable and provides a
        resulting wafer having a substantially uniform surface. The wafer includes
        a bulk substrate 11 and an insulating layer 13 formed overlying the bulk substrate
        15. A film of semiconductor material is formed overlying the insulating layer.
        Surface non-uniformities are formed overlying and in the film of semiconductor
        material. The non-uniformities are implanted, and are bordered by a substantially
        uniform interface 17 at a selected depth underlying the surface non-uniformities.
        The substantially uniform interface provides a substantially uniform resulting
        surface for the SOI wafer.","descriptionHtml":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br
        />FIG. 1 is a simplified cross-sectional view diagram of an SOI wafer having
        a non-uniform surface; and<br />FIGS. 2-7 are simplified cross-sectional view
        diagrams of the above SOI wafer according to the present invention.<br />(1)
        DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS<br />(2) According to the present invention,
        a technique including a method and device for removing surface non-uniformities
        on a surface(s) of a substrate such as an SOI wafer is provided. In exemplary
        embodiments, the technique also removes impurities from the bulk material
        of the SOI wafer, as well as removing surface roughness and non-uniformities.
        More particularly, the invention uses an implanting technique, which causes
        implant damage to a thickness of material having surface &quot;roughness,&quot;
        where the thickness of material is later selectively removed, thereby leaving
        a substantially uniform surface on the SOI wafer. The SOI wafer is made by
        way of a variety of techniques including a &quot;blister&quot; process such
        as Smart Cut.sup..TM.  or preferably a controlled cleaving process.<br />(3)
        FIG. 1 is a simplified cross-sectional view diagram of a partially completed
        SOI wafer 10 having an implanted material region according to the present
        invention. This diagram is merely an illustration and should not limit the
        scope of the claims herein. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize
        other modifications, alternatives, and variations.<br />(4) The SOI wafer
        10 is a partially completed wafer, which has a novel implanted layer 21. Among
        other elements, the SOI wafer includes a bulk substrate 11, which can be made
        of a variety of materials such as silicon, glass, and others. Overlying the
        bulk substrate 11 is an insulating layer 13, which is often made of oxide,
        but can also be other materials such as silicon nitride, multi-layered materials,
        and the like. A film of semiconductor material 15 (e.g., single crystal silicon)
        overlies the insulating layer 13.<br />(5) The semiconductor material 15 includes
        an implanted layer 21, which can have a lower material density than the bulk
        of the semiconductor material 15. As shown, the implanted layer includes an
        interface region defined by the dotted line and shown by reference numeral
        17. This interface region is a substantially uniform plane relative to the
        bulk of semiconductor material. Additionally, average density of the region
        overlying the interface region shown by reference numeral 17 is less than
        average density of the material in the bulk region 15. By way of different
        properties of layer 21 and layer 15, layer 21 can be selectively removed by
        way of a variety of semiconductor processing techniques such as etching, and
        others. In a specific embodiment, the implanted layer 21 is oxidized into
        a silicon dioxide layer, but can be converted to other materials. By removing
        the implanted layer 21 having non-uniformities, a fully planarized and substantially
        uniform substrate surface 17 can be made according to the present invention.<br
        />(6) In preferred embodiments, the implanted layer can also remove impurities
        by way of a gettering action from the bulk semiconductor material region 15,
        as well as other regions. These impurities include, among others, metals such
        as copper, nickel, silver, gold, or iron, and other mobile particles, which
        migrate within the semiconductor material region 15. With enhanced diffusion
        at elevated temperatures, impurities are trapped in the implanted layer by
        way of the rough or implanted structure. Alternatively, the type of material
        of the implanted layer attracts and holds impurities into the layer. The implanted
        layer therefore acts as a gettering layer for impurities, which become trapped
        in the implanted layer. These impurities can be eliminated by removing the
        implanted layer from the semiconductor material by way of selective etching
        and other fabrication techniques. Details of these fabrication techniques
        for this partially completed substrate, as well as completed fully planarized
        substrates are discussed below.<br />(7) FIGS. 2-7 are simplified diagrams
        of a method for fabricating the above SOI wafer according to the present invention.
        These diagrams are merely illustrations and should not limit the scope of
        the claims herein. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize other
        modifications, alternatives, and variations. The present invention provides
        a novel implanted layer, which can be removed, thereby leaving a substantially
        uniform SOI wafer, as well as eliminate impurities from active regions subsequently
        formed in the SOI wafer.<br />(8) A variety of techniques can be used to form
        the implanted layer and rough surface on the SOI wafer, for example. FIG.
        2 shows a simplified illustration of a cleaving or cut process, which effectively
        removes a portion 201 of a donor wafer from a thin film of detached material
        15. Depending upon the type of cleaving or cut process, surface 205 can be
        relatively non-uniform and have imperfections thereon, as shown. For example,
        donor substrate portion 201 is removed by way of a blister technique commonly
        termed Smart Cut.TM.. An example of this blister technique for removing film
        material 15 from donor substrate portion 201 is described in U.S. Pat. No.
        5,374,564, entitled, Process For The Production Of Thin Semiconductor Material
        Films, by Michel Bruel, issued Dec. 20, 1994 (the &quot;Bruel&quot; patent).
        The Bruel patent generally describes a process for globally raising the temperature
        of an implanted wafer to blister a film off of a wafer by way of expanding
        microbubbles. This technique can often form non-uniformities 205 or surface
        roughness and imperfections in the wafer surface, as shown. Additionally,
        the blister process produces a non-uniform layer, which has lateral and vertical
        roughness or non-uniformities. The non-uniformities must be removed before
        beginning the fabrication of active integrated circuit devices in the SOI
        wafer. The blister process forms implant damaged layer 203, which has a substantially
        uniform interface region 17. This uniform interface region is formed by way
        of the vertical straggle of the ion implant process used for a Smart Cut.TM..<br
        />(9) In an alternative specific embodiment, an implanted layer 303 including
        the surface roughness can be made by way of a controlled cleaving process.
        This process allows an initiation of a cleaving process on a substrate using
        a single or multiple cleave region(s) through the use of controlled energy
        (e.g., spatial distribution) and selected conditions to allow an initiation
        of a cleave front(s) and to allow it to propagate through the substrate to
        remove a thin film of material 15 from the substrate. The process is described
        in Henley et al, entitled A CONTROLLED CLEAVAGE PROCESS AND RESULTING DEVICE,
        filed May 12, 1997 (&quot;Henley&quot;) (Attorney Docket No. 18419-000100)
        and hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes. The controlled cleaving
        process provides a more uniform surface on the film as compared to the blister
        method described by Bruel, noted above. Additionally, the controlled cleaving
        process produces a uniform layer, which has limited lateral roughness that
        can be removed using the present technique. The controlled cleaving process
        also forms implant damaged layer 203, which has a substantially uniform interface
        region 17. This uniform interface region is formed by way of the straggle
        of the ion implant or plasma immersion implant process used for the controlled
        cleaving process.<br />(10) In still a further alternative embodiment, the
        implanted layer having the non-uniform surface is made by lower energy implantation
        of a non-uniform film, as shown by FIG. 3. As shown, a substrate 300, which
        includes the film of material 15, includes surface roughness or non-uniformities
        305. Energetic impurities or particles 301 can be introduced into the film
        of material 15 using one of numerous techniques. These techniques include
        beam line ion implantation, plasma immersion ion implantation, and others.
        The energetic particles cause implant damage to the film of material 303 having
        the surface non-uniformities 305. As merely an example, the energetic particles
        include, among other materials, charged (positive or negative) and/or neutral
        atoms or molecules, or electrons, or the like. In a specific embodiment, the
        particles can be neutral and/or charged particles including ions such as H+
        ions, rare gas ions such as helium and its isotopes, and neon, and deuterium.
        The particles can also be derived from compounds such as gases, e.g., hydrogen
        gas, water vapor, methane, hydrides, and hydrogen compounds, and other atomic
        mass particles. Alternatively, the particles can be any combination of the
        above particles, and/or ions and/or molecular species and/or atomic species.
        The particles generally have sufficient kinetic energy to enter into material
        15 to create the implanted layer 303 having a substantially uniform interface
        17. The substantially uniform interface is enhanced when the lateral straggle
        of the implant is greater than the characteristic size of the surface roughness.<br
        />(11) FIG. 3A is a more detailed diagram of FIG. 3 (or a detailed diagram
        similar to FIG. 2). This diagram is merely an illustration and should not
        limit the scope of the claims herein. One of ordinary skill in the art would
        recognize other variations, alternatives, and modifications. As shown, the
        implanted layer 303 includes the interface 17 at (z.sub.i), which is substantially
        uniform from the vertical straggle and the lateral straggle of the implant.
        The surface roughness 305 has an outer region defined at (z.sub.n) and an
        inner region defined by (z.sub.l). In most embodiments, the distance (defined
        by reference letter A) between the outer region and the inner region is less
        than the distance (defined by reference letter B) between the outer region
        and the interface. In a specific embodiment, the distance B is at least 1.0
        or 1.5 times the distance A. Alternatively, the distance B is at least 2 times
        the distance A. Alternatively, the distance B is at least 3 times the distance
        of A. Of course, the particular relative distances will depend upon the application.
        An explanation of implant straggle is explained in, for example, C. J. John
        Peng and N. W. Cheung, &quot;Two Dimensional Implantation Profile Simulator--RETRO,&quot;
        Nuclear Instrum. Methods, Vol. B74, pp. 222-225 (1993), which is hereby incorporated
        by reference.<br />(12) After forming a film (e.g., 303) having implanted
        surface non-uniformities such as anyone of the above SOI substrates, the material
        comprising the implanted surface non-uniformities is converted into another
        material, as illustrated by FIG. 4, for example. That is, the implanted surface
        non-uniformities made by silicon can be converted into silicon dioxide by
        way of an oxidation process. Oxidation occurs in a thermal annealing furnace
        using either oxygen or steam. Thermal annealing converts the implanted surface
        non-uniformities made of silicon into silicon dioxide. As shown, the surface
        includes non-uniformities 19 (or reference number 305 or 205) in the layer
        of silicon dioxide 21. A substantially uniform interface 17 is defined between
        the silicon dioxide 21 and silicon substrate material 15. The substantially
        uniform interface generally has a uniformity less than about 0.5% or more
        preferably less than about 0.3%.<br />(13) In order to better understand this
        technique of forming this substantially uniform interface 17, it may be helpful
        to describe the oxidation of silicon process in more detail using FIGS. 5
        and 6. FIG. 5 is a more detailed diagram of FIG. 4, and FIG. 6 is a diagram
        illustrating a density of the non-uniform implanted layer in silicon before
        oxidation. Referring to FIG. 5, for example, the SOI wafer includes, among
        other elements, the film of material 15, the interface 17, and the silicon
        dioxide layer 21, which includes the surface non-uniformities 19. The interface
        layer is defined along a horizontal plane at (z.sub.i) and the surface has
        an upper height at (z.sub.m). The lower height is defined by (z.sub.l). As
        shown, the silicon dioxide layer, which is previously silicon, converts into
        silicon dioxide, leaving a substantially uniform interface 17 in the silicon
        dioxide 21 layer, which is defined as the film of silicon 15.<br />(14) Before
        converting the silicon into silicon dioxide, the surface non-uniformities
        are implanted. By way of implanting, which causes implant damage, the density
        of the region having the non-uniformities is less than the density of the
        bulk silicon material. To illustrate the difference in densities between the
        implanted layer and the bulk silicon material, FIG. 6 is provided. As shown,
        the vertical axis represents the density of the materials, where .rho..sub.s
        represents the density of the bulk substrate and .rho..sub.t represents the
        density of the implanted layer. As shown, the density of the bulk substrate
        is greater than the density of the implanted layer. At the interface region
        (z.sub.i), the density of the substrate structure decreases to the density
        of the implanted layer until a lateral distance (z.sub.m), which is defined
        as the outer most point of the surface non-uniformities. This difference in
        densities allows oxygen molecules or ions to diffuse through and react with
        the implanted layer at a much faster rate than the diffusion of oxygen into
        the bulk silicon material. Since the diffusion or mass transfer rate of the
        oxygen is faster through the implanted layer, the oxygen converts substantially
        all of the silicon in the implanted layer into silicon dioxide before beginning
        to convert any of the silicon in the bulk substrate, which has a higher density.
        By way of limitations in mass transfer rates in the bulk silicon layer, oxidation
        of the bulk silicon layer essentially stops or slows down to a point where
        the interface 17 region forms in a substantially uniform manner.<br />(15)
        In a specific embodiment, the oxidized (or implanted) non-uniform layer also
        works as a gettering layer. For example, the non-uniform layer includes a
        surface roughness and an interface region, which can attract and trap impurities,
        that migrate in the subsequently formed active regions of the SOI wafer. Accordingly,
        the non-uniform layer can accumulate impurities such as metal contaminates
        from the active region. These impurities can be eliminated as the non-uniform
        layer is removed. This removal process is described in more detail below.<br
        />(16) Subsequent to oxidation of the non-uniform implanted layer, a selective
        removal process can be used to remove the non-uniform implanted layer from
        the bulk substrate 15, as shown in FIG. 7. For example, since the non-uniform
        implanted layer is made of oxide and the bulk substrate is made of silicon,
        a selective etchant can be used to selectively remove the oxide from the bulk
        silicon substrate. As merely an example, the selective etchant can include
        a variety of solutions such as hydrofluoric acid or the like, if a wet process
        is desired. Alternatively, the oxide can be selectively removed by way of
        a plasma etching or reactive ion etching or a plasma immersion process. Using
        a plasma process, an etchant includes, among other materials, a fluorine bearing
        compound(s), e.g., CF.sub.4, SF.sub.6. Of course, the type of etchant used
        will depend upon the<br />(17)  application.<br />(18) The etching process
        selectively removes the non-uniformities from the material region to leave
        a substantially uniform surface 701, for example. This substantially uniform
        surface has a surface uniformity less than about 0.5%, or less than about
        0.3% and lower, if needed. Preferably, the selective removal process is used
        with the controlled cleaving process, which generally provides a detached
        surface that is more uniform than those made by way of the blister technique
        such as Smart Cut.TM. and others.<br />(19) In an alternative embodiment,
        a final polishing step can be performed before using the wafer for integrated
        circuit processing. For example, the detached surface of the film of silicon
        material can be slightly rough and may need finishing, which occurs using
        a combination of grinding and/or polishing techniques. In some embodiments,
        the detached surface undergoes a step of grinding using, for examples, techniques
        such as rotating an abrasive material overlying the detached surface to remove
        any imperfections or surface roughness therefrom. A machine such as a &quot;back
        grinder&quot; made by a company called Disco may provide this technique.<br
        />(20) Alternatively, chemical mechanical polishing or planarization techniques
        finish the detached surface of the film. In CMP, a slurry mixture is applied
        directly to a polishing surface which is attached to a rotating platen. This
        slurry mixture can be transferred to the polishing surface by way of a metering
        pump, which is coupled to a slurry source. The slurry is often a solution
        containing an abrasive and an oxidizer, e.g., H.sub.2 O.sub.2, KIO.sub.3,
        ferric nitrate. The abrasive is often a borosilicate glass, titanium dioxide,
        titanium nitride, aluminum oxide, aluminum trioxide, iron nitrate, cerium
        oxide, silicon dioxide (colloidal silica), silicon nitride, silicon carbide,
        graphite, diamond, and any mixtures thereof. This abrasive is mixed in a solution
        of deionized water and oxidizer or the like. Preferably, the solution is acidic.
        Of course, the technique used to completely finish the surface of the wafer
        depends upon the application.<br />(21) While the above is a full description
        of the specific embodiments, various modifications, alternative constructions
        and equivalents may be used. Therefore, the above description and illustrations
        should not be taken as limiting the scope of the present invention which is
        defined by the appended claims.","claimsHtml":"1. A method for fabricating

        />(2) The present invention relates to the manufacture of integrated circuits.
        More particularly, the present invention provides a technique for planarizing
        substrates using a novel implanting technique. This invention is illustrated
        using, for example, silicon-on-insulator wafers, but can be applied to other
        types of substrates.<br />(3) Integrated circuits are fabricated on chips
        of semiconductor material. These integrated circuits often contain thousands,
        or even millions, of transistors and other devices. In particular, it is desirable
        to put as many transistors as possible within a given area of semiconductor
        because more transistors typically provide greater functionality, and a smaller
        chip means more chips per wafer and lower costs.<br />(4) Some integrated
        circuits are fabricated on a slice or wafer, of single-crystal (monocrystalline)
        silicon, commonly termed a &quot;bulk&quot; silicon wafer. Devices on such
        &quot;bulk&quot; silicon wafer typically are isolated from each other. A variety
        of techniques have been proposed or used to isolate these devices from each
        other on the bulk silicon wafer, such as a local oxidation of silicon (&quot;LOCOS&quot;)
        process, trench isolation, and others. These techniques, however, are not
        free from limitations. For example, conventional isolation techniques consume
        a considerable amount of valuable wafer surface area on the chip, and often
        generate a non-planar surface as an artifact of the isolation process. Either
        or both of these considerations generally limit the degree of integration
        achievable in a given chip. Additionally, trench isolation often requires
        a process of reactive ion etching, which is extremely time consuming and can
        be difficult to achieve accurately.<br />(5) An approach to achieving very-large
        scale integration (&quot;VLSI&quot;) or ultra-large scale integration (&quot;ULSI&quot;)
        is by using a semiconductor-on-insulator (&quot;SOI&quot;) wafer. An SOI wafer
        typically has a layer of silicon on top of a layer of an insulator material.
        A variety of techniques have been proposed or used for fabricating the SOI
        wafer. These techniques include, among others, growing a thin layer of silicon
        on a sapphire substrate, bonding a layer of silicon to an insulating substrate,
        and forming an insulating layer beneath a silicon layer in a bulk silicon
        wafer. In an SOI integrated circuit, essentially complete device isolation
        is often achieved using conventional device processing methods by surrounding
        each device, including the bottom of the device, with an insulator. An advantage
        SOI wafers have over bulk silicon wafers is that the area required for isolation
        between devices on an SOI wafer is less than the area typically required for
        isolation on a bulk silicon wafer.<br />(6) SOI offers other advantages over
        bulk silicon technologies as well. For example, SOI offers a simpler fabrication
        sequence compared to a bulk silicon wafer. Devices fabricated on an SOI wafer
        may also have better radiation resistance, less photo-induced current, and
        less cross-talk than devices fabricated on bulk silicon wafers. Many problems,
        however, that have already been solved regarding fabricating devices on bulk
        silicon wafers remain to be solved for fabricating devices on SOI wafers.<br
        />(7) Numerous limitations still exist with the use of SOI wafers for the
        fabrication of integrated circuits. For example, devices within integrated
        circuits in SOI wafers are very sensitive to the presence of even minute concentrations
        of some impurities. For example, metals, such as copper, nickel, silver, gold,
        or iron, within the active region of a device typically degrade several device
        characteristics, including leakage current and breakdown voltage. These and
        other metals rapidly diffuse through silicon at temperatures typical of semiconductor
        device fabrication processes. These impurities often become trapped in the
        active region of the SOI wafer. That is, the SOI wafer includes a dielectric
        layer or insulating layer underlying the active region that tends to keep
        impurities in the active layer, rather than diffusing down into the bulk silicon.
        Accordingly, SOI wafers are prone to device and reliability problems caused
        by the presence of impurities that cannot diffuse out of the active region.<br
        />(8) SOI wafers generally must also be polished to remove any surface irregularities
        from the film of silicon overlying the insulating layer. Polishing generally
        includes, among others, chemical mechanical polishing, commonly termed CMP.
        CMP is generally time consuming and expensive, and can be difficult to perform
        cost efficiently to remove surface non-uniformities. That is, a CMP machine
        is expensive and requires large quantities of slurry mixture, which is also
        expensive.<br />(9) Furthermore, the film of silicon on the insulator layer
        is often polished by way of polishing techniques such as chemical mechanical
        polishing and others. Polishing is often required to clean the silicon surface
        and remove any non-uniformities therefrom. Polishing, however, is extremely
        time consuming and expensive. Polishing also introduces the wafer to a slurry
        mixture, which can be highly acidic or caustic. Accordingly, the slurry mixture
        can influence functionality and reliability of devices that are fabricated
        on the SOI wafer.<br />(10) From the above, it is seen that an improved technique
        for manufacturing a substrate such as an SOI wafer is highly desirable.<br
        />(11) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br />(12) According to the present invention,
        a technique including a method and device for removing surface non-uniformities
        and impurities from a substrate such as an SOI wafer is provided. In an exemplary
        embodiment, the technique uses a novel implanting step to provide an implanted
        layer with surface roughness that can be planarized. Planarization occurs
        by way of processing steps such as oxidation and selective removal of the
        non-uniform film.<br />(13) In a specific embodiment, the present invention
        provides a method for fabricating a substrate such as a silicon-on-insulator
        wafer using a novel implanting step, which enhances film uniformity. The method
        uses a step of providing a semiconductor substrate, which includes a thickness
        of material having a surface. The surface of the semiconductor substrate includes
        non-uniformities or &quot;roughness&quot; formed from, for example, a detachment
        process, that is, the non-uniformities can be made by way of a process such
        as a controlled cleaving process, or a process called Smart Cut.TM., or any
        others. The thickness of material has a volume defined by the surface and
        a selected depth, which has a substantially uniform surface at the selected
        depth. The thickness of material is also characterized by implant damage (e.g.,
        structural, change in material property) which extends from the surface to
        the selected depth. The thickness of material is converted into an insulating
        material such as silicon dioxide at least up to the selected depth. The insulating
        material is selectively removed (e.g., wet or dry etching) from the semiconductor
        substrate to provide a substantially uniform surface overlying the semiconductor
        substrate.<br />(14) In an alternative specific embodiment, the present invention
        provides a substrate such as an SOI wafer having a novel implanted layer to
        provide a uniform surface on the wafer. The wafer includes a bulk substrate
        and an insulating layer formed overlying the bulk substrate. A film of semiconductor
        material is formed overlying the insulating layer. Surface non-uniformities
        (e.g., roughness) are formed overlying a thickness of material in the film.
        The thickness of material has a volume defined by a selected depth, which
        has a substantially uniform planar surface at that selected depth. The thickness
        of material is characterized by implant damage, which extends from the surface
        to the selected depth. This implant<br />(15)  damaged thickness of material
        can be removed by way of oxidation and selective etching techniques, thereby
        leaving a substantially uniform surface.<br />(16) In still a further embodiment,
        the present invention generally provides a method and resulting (and intermediary)
        structures for planarizing a substrate or film overlying the substrate (e.g.,
        silicon wafer). The substrate or film includes a thickness of material having
        surface non-uniformities or roughness. Particles are implanted into the thickness
        of material through the surface non-uniformities to a selected depth, which
        has a substantially planar surface. The implanted thickness of material includes
        damage therein, e.g., structural or change in composition. The thickness of
        material is converted into another material such as an oxide layer, which
        can be selectively removed by processing techniques such as etching or the
        like. By way of selective removal of the implanted thickness of material,
        a substantially planar surface remains on the film of material or the substrate.<br
        />(17) Numerous benefits are achieved using the present invention over pre-existing
        techniques. For example, the present invention provides an efficient technique
        for forming a substantially uniform surface on an SOI wafer. Additionally,
        the substantially uniform surface is made by way of common oxidation and etching
        techniques. Furthermore, the present invention provides a novel non-uniform
        layer, which can act as a gettering layer for removing impurities from to
        be active regions of the SOI wafer. These and other benefits are described
        throughout the present specification and more particularly below.<br />(18)
