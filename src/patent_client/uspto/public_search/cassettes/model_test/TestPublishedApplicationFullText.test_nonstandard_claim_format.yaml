        2</figref>. OTDR configuration shows pulsed light injected into distributed
        fiber sensor. The resulting trace resulting from the Rayleigh backscatter
        in the fiber is shown as the black curve. If the laser is highly coherent,
        the trace develops \u201Cripples\u201D (red curve) resulting from interference
        of the scattered light. Such signals can be processed in a manner analogous
        to processing seismic signals, using sophisticated programs and computationally
        fast machines.<br />DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE<br />[0073] The
        disclosure provides a novel method of well ranging using DAS sensors. DAS
        transforms nearly any fiber-optic cable into a distributed array of acoustic
        sensors. To record data requires a specialized Coherent Optical Time Domain
        Reflectometer (C-OTDR) unit referred to as an \u201CInterrogator Unit\u201D
        or \u201CIU\u201D, which is connected to the fiber used for measurement.<br
        />[0074] Currently, an entire (\u02DC4 km) cable can be sampled at a rate
        of up to 20 kHz. At this rate, the IU injects laser pulses into the fiber,
        and as the fiber is strained by external acoustic disturbances, the IU processes
        and records the changes in the back-scattered light. Processing divides the
        fiber into a distributed array of acoustic sensors, which results in data
        that is comparable to conventional seismic data recorded on geophones.<br
        />[0075] An optical pulse is launched into the fiber and minute portions of
        the light traveling outward are (Rayleigh) scattered backwards in a distributed
        manner such that this scattered light returning may be measured temporally
        with a fast receiver to produce a record or trace of distributed loss of the
        fiber out to distances of 10's of Km.<br />[0076] If the optical pulses are
        made with a narrow line width, high coherence laser, then these scattered
        return light signals will interfere with each other causing signal ripples
        that superimpose the loss trace. This is shown in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG.
        2</figref>. These ripples, because they are related to the fixed Rayleigh
        scatter sites within a fiber, are static as long as the fiber is static. If
        the fiber experiences any perturbations, or external forces, which strain
        the fiber, the positions of the scatter sites change. This in turn changes
        the interferometric induced ripples.<br />[0077] Dynamic sensitivities down
        to the few angstrom levels are achievable. The result is a highly sensitive
        distributed sensing mechanism, known as Coherent Optical Time Domain Reflectometry
        (COTDR), and more recently known as Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS).<br
        />[0078] Because light in an optical fiber travels at approximately 0.2 m/ns,
        a 10-ns pulse of light occupies about 2 m in the fiber as it propagates. The
        potential of DAS is that each 10 nanoseconds of time in the optical echo response
        can be associated with reflections coming from a 1-m portion of the fiber
        (two-way time of 10 ns). By generating a repeated pulse every 100 \u03BCs
        and continuously processing the returned optical signal, one can, in principle,
        interrogate each meter of up to 10 km of fiber at a 10-kHz sample rate. Local
        changes in the optical backscatter because of changes in the environment of
        the fiber can thus become the basis for using the fiber as a continuous array
        of sensors with nearly continuous sampling in both space and time.<br />[0079]
        Preferably, the system digitally records both the amplitude, frequency and
        phase of the acoustic fields up to tens of kilohertz at every location along
        and, hence, can \u201Clisten\u201D to every point along the fiber. The system
        can offer 1 meter spatial resolution with a wide dynamic range of more than
        90 dB and with no cross-talk. The fiber thus acts as an acoustic antenna and
        can be deployed in multi-dimensional configurations to enhance its sensitivity,
        directionality and frequency response.<br />[0080] Silixa (Hertfordshire UK),
        for example sells the iDas\u2122 system with a new optoelectronics architecture
        that collects the true acoustic signal\u2014amplitude, frequency and phase\u2014to
        accurately and rapidly measure backscattered signal with a precision and speed
        that allows acoustic measurements. In addition, all sensing points are phase-matched,
        therefore the acoustic response along the fiber can be combined to enhance
        the detection sensitivity by two-orders of magnitude, which would enable to
        step beyond the performance of current point sensors and as well as achieving
        highly directional information.<br />[0081] One of the challenges is processing
        a large volume of the data collected at high speeds. For 10 km of fiber, 1
        m intervals at 10 kHz sampling, the minimum data rate is 100 MSamples/s. A
        number of fast signal processing techniques have been developed to analyze
        the acoustic spectrum of the signal along the entire length of fiber and identify
        flow characteristics along the wellbore. In addition using coherent phase
        array processing techniques, the propagation of the acoustic energy along
        the wellbore can be analyzed in space-frequency domain (k-\u03C9) to determine
        the speed of sound and, thereby, measure the fluid composition and velocity.<br
        />[0082] DAS systems currently use single-mode fiber, as opposed to the multimode
        fiber typically used for DTS, but the type of fiber does not affect deployment,
        and multiple fibers are easily deployed in a single capillary tube.<br />[0083]
        A DAS fiber optic cable is deployed in the Reference Well to determine relative
        distance and direction from Active Well, which is e.g., being actively drilled.
        Neither dedicated installation of fiber nor any optimization of the cable
        construction or connectors is needed, and we used wireline to deploy the DAS
        cable, although other methods can be used.<br />[0084] Unlike the fiber cables
        used in the communication industry, fiber optics designed for oil and gas
        wells utilize specialized glass chemistry, coatings and construction to withstand
        downhole conditions. DAS fiber optic cable suitable for use herein is available
        from a number of suppliers, including OFS (Norcross Ga.); Halliburton (Houston
        Tex.), Schlumberger (Houston Tex.); BMP Enterprises (Belleville Tex.) and
        the like.<br />[0085] The DAS cable is connected at the surface to a C-OTDR,
        which receives, records and processes the signals. OTDR instruments are available
        from many manufacturers, including Anritsu America (Richardson Tex.), PiMON
        (Munich Germany); AFL Global (Duncan S.C.). Further, most of the companies
        selling the DAS fiber optic cable for downhole use also sell the OTDR units
        and have dedicated software thereon for the signal analysis algorithms unique
        to this industry.<br />[0086] Drilling noise and any other acoustic emissions
        generated in the Active Well (e.g. drilling, perforations, hydraulic fracturing,
        etc.) are recorded and processed by the OTDR using the DAS fiber in the Reference
        Well and based on that information, the drilling of the Active Well can be
        steered toward the Reference Well if intersection is desired, or steered to
        be parallel thereto, for example in SAGD wellpairs, or otherwise steered for
        the well configuration that is needed.<br />[0087] For a given acoustic source
        emission location in the Active Well, a unique signal pattern will be generated
        and recorded by the DAS system in the Reference Well. A variety of pattern
        recognition, signal processing, and event location techniques may then be
        used to determine the range between the Reference and Active wells to high
        precision.<br />[0088] To date, we have tested the above concept using ______
        and found that the system is accurate up to ______ inches. Recordings were
        made while tools were run in hole, during drilling, perfing and fracking and
        the technology proved sufficiently reliable and sensitive to detect these
        in-well activities and use that information to determine distance and direction
        from the reference well hosting the DAS cable.<br />[0089] The present invention
        is exemplified with respect to an Active Well that was drilled for test purposes.
        However, this is exemplary only, and the invention can be broadly applied
        to control any desired well configuration. The following examples are intended
        to be illustrative only, and not unduly limit the scope of the appended claims.<br
        />Test 1<br />[0090] For the testing of the system described herein, we will
        deploy DAS cable into a Reference Well using wirelines. 2000 meters of cable
        is deployed into a local well, and signals recorded using a C-OTDR. An Active
        well is initiated 50 m from the original Reference wellpad, with a pathway
        intended to intersect the Reference well. Signals received by the DAS cable
        in the reference well are interpreted. Our preliminary results are expected
        to show complete accuracy, such that the wells intersect as planned.<br />[0091]
        Using OTDR technology, it is possible to determine an amount of backscattered
        light arriving from any point along the fiber optic cable. Although the duration
        of the light pulse determines the lower limit on the spatial resolution, the
        resulting signal can be used to extract information at any larger interval.
        This can be accomplished by dividing the backscattered light signal into a
        series of bins in time. The data within each bin is summed to give information
        about the average strain on the length of fiber between the endpoints of the
        bin. These bins can be made arbitrarily large to sample longer sections of
        the fiber.<br />[0092] The bins may be equally sized and continuously spread
        over the entire length of the fiber with the end of one bin becoming the start
        of the next, but if desired, the size and position of each bin, in addition
        to the spacing between consecutive bins, can be tailored to yield the optimum
        desired spatial sampling resolution and sensitivity. [0093] Thus, by time-gating
        the received backscattered signal, each fiber optic cable can be treated as
        a plurality of discrete, distributed acoustic \u201Csensors\u201D (DAS), with
        each sensor corresponding to a section of cable. The time-gating can be controlled
        to produce sections/sensors that are as long or as short as desired. For example,
        one portion of the cable can sense at high resolution, using relatively short
        sections of cable having lengths L\u2212.sub.1, while another portion of cable
        can sense at a lower resolution, using relatively long sections of cable having
        lengths L.sub.2. In some embodiments, higher-resolution section length L.sub.1
        preferably falls within the range 0.1 to 10 m and lower-resolution section
        length L.sub.2 preferably falls within the range 10 to 1000+ m. [0094] One
        of the challenges is processing a large volume of the data collected at high
        speeds. For 10 km of fiber, 1 m intervals at 10 kHz sampling, the minimum
        data rate is 100 MSamples/s. A number of fast signal processing techniques
        have been developed to analyze the acoustic spectrum of the signal along the
        entire length of fiber and identify flow characteristics along the wellbore.
        In addition using coherent phase array processing techniques, the propagation
        of the acoustic energy along the wellbore can be analyzed in space-frequency
        domain (k-\u03C9) to determine the speed of sound and, thereby, measure distance,
        etc.<br />[0095] One example of a suitable DAS technology is a system called
        Blue Rose. This system exploits the physical phenomenon of Rayleigh optical
        scattering, which occurs naturally in optical fibers used traditionally for
        OTDR techniques. Blue Rose detects backscattered light and uses the signal
        to give information about acoustic events caused by activities near the cable.
        The sensor is a single strand of single-mode optical fiber with an elastomeric,
        polymeric, metallic, ceramic, or composite coating that is buried in the ground
        at a depth of approximately nine inches. Alternatively, coherent OTDR (C-OTDR)
        processes can be used to obtain similar acoustic information from an optical
        system, as disclosed in US Application No. 20090114386. [0096] In other embodiments,
        an optical system such as that described in U.S. application Ser. No. 2008277568
        can be used. That system uses pulsed pairs of light signals that have different
        frequencies and are separated in time. If used, such a system allows processing
        of the signal to be carried out more easily and with a greater signal-to noise
        ratio than is the case if radiation of a single frequency backscattered from
        different positions along the length of optical fiber is used to generate
        a signal at a photodetector by interferometery.<br />[0097] The present disclosure
        also relates to a computing apparatus for performing the operations herein.

        processing, or it may comprise a general-purpose computer selectively activated

        memories (RAMs), EPROMs, EEPROMs, magnetic or optical cards, or any type of
        media suitable for storing electronic instructions, each coupled to a computer
        system bus.<br />[0098] In one embodiment, the computer system or apparatus
        may include graphical user interface (GUI) components such as a graphics display
        and a keyboard which can include a pointing device (e.g., a mouse, trackball,

        may be used both to display data and processed data and to allow the user
        to select among options for implementing aspects of the method or for adding
        information about reservoir inputs or parameters to the computer programs.
        The computer system may store the results of the system and methods described
        above on disk storage, for later use and further interpretation and analysis.
        Additionally, the computer system may include on or more processors for running
        said spreadsheet and simulation programs.<br />[0099] As yet another option,
        the computer program can provide a display of the two wells, their existing
        placement as well as the planned trajectory. Using this display, the drilling
        operator can control the trajectory to compensate for any unplanned deviations.<br

        SPONSORED RESEARCH STATEMENT<br />[0002] Not applicable.<br />FIELD OF THE
        DISCLOSURE<br />[0003] The invention relates to drilling oil and gas wells,
        and in particular to methods of well ranging using distributed acoustic sensors.<br
        />BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE<br />[0004] In the oil and gas industry, \u201Cwell
        ranging\u201D or \u201Cwellbore surveying\u201D or \u201Cborehole surveying\u201D
        is the art of determining exactly where an underground well is so that the
        next well can either be intersected or avoided, as needed.<br />[0005] Only
        under ideal conditions will the path of a drilled hole follow the original
        dip (or inclination) and azimuth (or direction) established at the top of
        the hole. It is more typical that the borehole will be deflected from the
        intended direction as a result of layering in the rock, the variation in the
        hardness of the layers, and the angle of the drill bit relative to these layers.<br
        />[0006] Because one of the purposes of a borehole is to obtain information
        in the third dimension\u2014i.e. at depth\u2014the location is just as important
        as the information itself. Most often the information consists of the geology
        of the drill core or assays of the core at selected depths. If the hole has
        deviated significantly, then that information cannot be properly assigned
        to a location in 3-dimensional space beneath the earth's surface. Conclusions
        about geological structure or models of the size, shape, tonnage and average
        grade of ore-bodies based on the \u2018mis-placed\u2019 information will be
        incorrect.<br />[0007] Furthermore, in crowded fields it may be necessary
        to avoid drilling in already tapped payzones and/or to avoid existing wells.
        Alternatively, it may be desired to intersect a given well at a particular
        depth and angle. Indeed with unconventional oil development, unusual well
        configurations are often needed to realize the value of a play and may be
        the norm rather than the exception.<br />[0008] Thus, determining the distance
        and direction between wellbores is critical in many applications. In addition
        to being used for relief-well applications, parallel twinning for developments
        such as steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) and coalbed methane (CBM) horizontal-to-vertical
        intersections use ranging technology. As more fields mature, ranging technology
        can be used in other applications such as plug and abandonment wells, frac
        recovery, and for in-fill applications where anti-collision and relative wellbore
        positioning between multiple wells is of concern.<br />[0009] In the early
        years drilling was more of an art than a science. The general principals of
        geology and exploration were understood and followed, but the effects of formation
        changes and dip on bit deflection and hence borehole trajectory were not clearly
        understood and largely ignored. This perpetuated state of ignorance lead to
        many unresolved lease disputes, where wells drilled and brought on stream,
        close to an adjacent lease, would often result in diminished production rates
        on the adjacent lease wells. However, wells already in production were cased
        and the magnetic compass based survey instruments available could not provide
        post-completion trajectory data. Throughout this time, many inclination-only
        devices were developed, later versions of which were accurate to 1 or 2 degrees
        throughout their operating range.<br />[0010] In 1929 gyroscopes were designed
        that would provide the inclination of the borehole and the direction of that
        inclination within casing. The first gyros used by the industry had no means
        of inner gimbal/spin axis control, but the surveyor could determine its approximate
        position from the film record at each survey station. These gyros were originally
        intended for use up to 20-30 degrees inclination. However, as borehole inclinations
        increased, hardware improvements were made and operational techniques were
        developed that enabled these tools to be used successfully beyond 60 degrees
        inclination.<br />[0011] Since then, numerous borehole surveying devices have
        been developed, none of which are perfect. Reasonably accurate results are
        possible by properly using the right tool in the right hole, but all devices
        have their limitations. Surveying a borehole is usually accomplished by moving
        a probe along the hole and sensing the movement of the probe relative to one
        or more frames of reference, which may include the earth's gravitational field,
        magnetic field or other inertial reference, and/or by sensing the distortion
        or bending of the housing of the probe itself.<br />[0012] Different methods
        have their own advantages and limitations. Some have the ability to operate
        inside steel casing, and others cannot. Some methods are time consuming and
        others are fast. Some are relatively simple to use and others are complex
        to operate. Other considerations are accuracy, cost, distance between measurements,
        ruggedness and reliability.<br />[0013] Thus, there remains a continuing need
        in the art for ever-improved borehole surveying methods, systems and devices
        to increase the accuracy of borehole surveying. The ideal method would be
        fast, easy to use, and cost effective, but without sacrificing accuracy, ruggedness
        and reliability.<br />SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE<br />[0014] Driven by the
        needs for ever-faster broadband transmission, optical fiber technology has
        improved dramatically and now approaches theoretical limits in terms of attenuation
        and precision manufacturing. Taking advantage of such refinements, non-transmission
        applications have now come to the forefront and optical fibers are increasingly
        deployed as sensing elements in numerous industries and applications.<br />[0015]
        In one embodiment, Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) provides near real-time
        measurement utilizing optical fiber by taking advantage of its low attenuation
        and long reach in addition to its dielectric nature and immunity to radio
        frequency and electromagnetic interference. DAS converts the optical fiber
        into a lengthy sensor element (up to 50 km) and detects events with very high
        resolution over the entire distance. With a spatial resolution of 1 meter,
        for example, there will be 10,000 synchronized sensors along a 10,000 meter
        fiber.<br />[0016] Acoustic sensing works by coupling coherent laser energy
        pulses into optical fiber and analyzing naturally occurring Rayleigh backscatter.
        See e.g. <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 1</figref>. Light pulses, as
        they travel from the input to distal end, interact at a molecular level with
        the materials that comprise the core of the fiber. Such interactions cause
        a small amount of light to backscatter and return to the input end where they
        are detected and analyzed. Acoustic waves, when interacting with the materials
        that comprise the optical fiber, create small changes in the refractive index.
        These changes affect the backscatter characteristics, becoming detectable
        events. Using time-domain techniques, event location is precisely determined,
        providing fully distributed sensing with resolution of 1 meter or less.<br
        />[0017] Due to the ability of the optic fiber to operate in harsh environments,
        the technology can also be used in oil well monitoring applications, allowing
        real-time information on the state of the well to be determined. The industry
        first used downhole fiber optic sensing in the 1990's for single-point pressure
        and temperature sensors. Distributed temperature sensing followed. The oil
        and gas industry provides numerous applications where DAS can be implemented,
        promising the lowest cost per sensor point. Examples include pipeline monitoring
        for distributed flow, distributed seismic detection, and leak detection. In
        addition to pipeline monitoring, harsh environment optical fibers are commonly
        used for in-well applications to detect fracturing processes, leaks, flow
        and seismic activity, all in distributed fashion, allowing for thousands of
        discrete sensing points along a single optical fiber.<br />[0018] However,
        to date, DAS sensors have not been use in borehole surveying.<br />[0019]
        In one embodiment the method described herein uses a DAS fiber optic cable
        in a Reference Well to determine relative distance from an Active Well that
        is being actively drilled or otherwise manipulated. The DAS fiber may be deployed
        in the Reference Well in a variety of manners\u2014fixed to the casing, fixed
        to the tubing, deployed as a wireline or in coiled tubing.<br />[0020] Drilling
        noise and any other acoustic emissions generated in the Active Well (e.g.
        perforations, hydraulic fracturing, drilling jars, etc.) are recorded using
        the DAS fiber in the Reference Well. For a given acoustic source emission
        location in the Active Well, a unique signal pattern will be generated and
        recorded by the DAS system in the Reference Well. A variety of pattern recognition,
        signal processing, and event location techniques may then be used to determine
        the range between the Active and Reference Well to high precision and this
        information used to guide the path of the Active Well to achieve the desired
        well configuration.<br />[0021] As used herein, \u201CDAS\u201D or \u201CDistributed
        Acoustic Sensing\u201D refers to Rayleigh scatter based distributed fiber
        optic sensing, wherein a coherent laser pulse is sent along an optic fiber,
        and scattering sites within the fiber cause the fiber to act as a distributed
        interferometer with a gauge length approximately equal to the pulse length.
        The intensity of the reflected light is measured as a function of time after
        transmission of the laser pulse. When the pulse has had time to travel the
        full length of the fiber and back, the next laser pulse can be sent along
        the fiber. Changes in the reflected intensity of successive pulses from the
        same region of fiber are caused by changes in the optical path length of that
        section of fiber. This type of system is very sensitive to both strain and
        temperature variations of the fiber and measurements can be made simultaneously
        at all sections of the fiber.<br />[0022] Before the next laser pulse can
        be transmitted the previous one must have had time to travel to the far end
        of the fiber and for the reflections from there to return, otherwise reflections
        would be returning from different sections of the fiber at the same time and
        the system would not operate properly. For a fiber 50 km long the maximum
        pulse rate is just over 2 kHz. Therefore strains can be measured which vary
        at frequencies up to the Nyquist frequency of 1 kHz. Shorter fibers clearly
        enable higher acquisition rates.<br />[0023] As used herein, the \u201CReference
        Well\u201D is the well equipped with a DAS cable that is operatively coupled
        to a C-OTDR or equivalent equipment. In some embodiments more than one Reference
        Well may be used, e.g., in triangulation applications.<br />[0024] As used
        herein, the \u201CActive Well\u201D is that provides the acoustic signals
        for sensing by the Reference Well. Also, a \u201Ctest\u201D well.<br />[0025]
