        method and apparatus for hand-held portable illumination. A flashlight and
        corresponding method are described. The flashlight includes a housing, a plurality
        of LEDs, and an electrical circuit that selectively applies power from the
        DC voltage source to the LED units, wherein the flashlight is suitable for
        handheld portable operation by a user. In one embodiment, the first electrical
        circuit further includes a control circuit for maintaining a predetermined
        light output level of the LED units as a charge on a battery varies. In another
        embodiment, the control circuit maintains an average predetermined light output
        level of the LED units as the charge on the battery cell varies by changing
        a pulse width or frequency as the charge on the battery cell varies to maintain
        a given average light output. Another aspect provides an illumination source
        that includes a light-emitting diode (LED) housing including one or more LEDs,
        and a control circuit that selectively applies power from a source of electric
        power to the LEDs, the control circuit substantially maintaining a light output
        characteristic of the LEDs as a voltage of the voltage source varies over
        a range that would otherwise vary the light output characteristic. Still another
        aspect provides an illumination source including a light-emitting diode (LED)
        housing including one or more LEDs; and a control circuit that selectively
        applies power from a source of electric power to the LEDs, thus maintaining
        or controlling a light output color spectrum of the LEDs.","descriptionHtml":"BRIEF

        />(1) DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br />(2) In the following de tailed
        description of the preferred embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying
        drawings that form a part hereof and in which are shown by way of illustration
        specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is understood
        that o the r embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made
        without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br />(3) The present
        invention takes advantage of the efficiency of high-intensity, light-emitting
        diodes (LEDs) in the visible spectrum and/or infra-red (IR) or ultra-violet
        (UV), arranged in various patterns, the low-voltage properties of CMOS integrated
        circuits and components, and the efficiency derived from switching the current
        to and limiting the duration of current to the LEDs to project light efficiently
        and with constant brightness even as the battery supply voltage decays over
        time. The invention takes advantage of the dynamic impedance of the LEDs which
        causes the voltage across the LED to rise rapidly relative to the current
        flow through the LED to limit the initial current flow to the LED, when battery
        voltage is highest, to prevent wire bond heating from causing premature failure
        of the LEDs. The present invention controls the current flow duration (pulse
        width) to limit power dissipation in the LEDs during the LEDs'' on state,
        and increasing the pulse width as the battery voltage decreases over time
        to maintain substantially constant perceived or average LED intensity over
        the course of the battery''s life. The invention controls the switching frequency
        of the pulse width to further control the LED intensity and power dissipation
        while maintaining a constant light output from the LEDs as perceived or visible
        to the human eye, or a light-sensing device, e.g., camera, night-vision scope,
        CMOS and CCD sensor and pixel arrays. The present invention provides a compact,
        portable light source, preferably sized to be readily hand-held, for illuminating
        an object, several objects, or areas for human use and/or machine operation.
        In one embodiment, the invention measures battery voltage and in turn regulates
        the LED intensity. In another embodiment, the present invention uses a light-sensing
        device such as a light-sensing transistor or light-detecting diode (LDD) in
        proximity to the output LED(s) to measure the average brightness and further
        regulate the LEDs'' output.<br />(4) Another embodiment of the present invention
        provides operator-selectable control of the pulse frequency and/or the pulse
        width to provide a reduced apparent brightness in order to increase battery
        life in situations when maximum brightness is not required. In one such pulse-frequency
        embodiment, the apparent (visible) pulse frequency would provide a stroboscope
        effect for safety or entertainment. In this embodiment, the visibly interrupted
        or pulsed pulse train may include repetitive pulses or a coded sequence as
        in Morse code &quot;SOS&quot; or a predetermined password or security string
        of pulses that may then be used as a key or identifier. A further refinement
        of this embodiment would provide the user with a method for strobing out a
        message. It is understood that what appears to be a single visible pulse may
        actually include a high-frequency series of pulses in order to increase the
        apparent brightness of a single pulse while also protecting the LEDs from
        excessive power dissipation. In yet another pulse-frequency embodiment of
        the invention, a variable or adjustable constant sequence pulse train is established
        for the accurate measurement of the velocity or frequency of an object in
        motion or vibration.<br />(5) Another embodiment of the present invention
        uses various colored LEDs for specialized purposes. In one such embodiment,
        long-wavelength LEDs, 660 nm or longer, are used to provide underwater divers
        or aquarium enthusiasts a light source for observing undersea life at night
        without adversely affecting the nocturnal activities of such wildlife. This
        functionality is also useful for tropical aquarium owners who also wish to
        observe the nocturnal activities of the occupants of their aquariums. In another
        such embodiment, short-wavelength blue LEDs are used with a UV filter to view
        fluorescing materials, including but not limited to: taggants, stamps, security
        codes and security seals. As UV LEDs become readily available (such as those
        announced as made by IBM Corporation in the Mar. 9, 1998 issue of Electronic
        Engineering Times, page 39), these could be used in place of the blue LEDs.
        In other embodiments, a suitable LED normally emitting in the blue spectrum,
        for example made from GaN (gallium nitride) or InGaN (indium gallium nitride),
        is pulsed by pulses of sufficiently high current to blue-shift the output
        and sufficiently short duration to not destroy the LED in order to maintain
        a constant light intensity while shifting the color spectrum from blue to
        ultraviolet. Other embodiments include IR LEDs for military or police use
        to enhance the usefulness of night-vision equipment and for friend-or-foe
        identification, multiple color LEDs to produce a white light source, and combinations
        of colored LEDs to enhance the ability of color-blind individuals to perceive
        colors. Other uses include LEDs chosen for use in photographic darkrooms wherein
        the LED wavelength is chosen to prevent undesired exposure of light-sensitive
        materials.<br />(6) Another embodiment of the present invention uses LEDs
        of various &quot;viewing&quot; angles to achieve wide-angle viewing versus
        narrow-angle, long-range viewing and combinations thereof. A further refinement
        of this embodiment utilizes a Fresnel lens (or other lens or reflector arrangement)
        to provide a focusable light source. Another embodiment uses polarizers to
        reduce specular reflections for enhanced viewing or for use in machine-vision
        applications. Another embodiment utilizes quickly and easily pluggable/replaceable
        LED arrays or heads of various shapes, colors, and/or viewing angles for different
        applications.<br />(7) In yet another embodiment, the light output is momentarily
        interrupted repetitively, or strobed, to indicate low battery condition with
        some estimation of time to battery failure, e.g., the number of pulses could
        indicate the estimated number of minutes of battery time. As the estimation
        of time to battery failure changes, the repetition rate is varied to indicate
        impending battery failure. It is understood that this operational mode is
        easily distinguished from other operational modes by the duration of on time
        versus off time. In strobe mode, low battery condition is indicated by dropping
        pulses; e.g., every fourth output pulse is dropped, or three of four pulses
        is dropped creating an easily distinguishable variance in visible output of
        the invention.<br />(8) In another embodiment of the invention, a switch is
        utilized to control the functions (and/or brightness) of the invention. A
        variance of this embodiment uses a thumb-wheel, or rotary switch to vary the
        switching characteristics to produce a variable light output.<br />(9) In
        another embodiment, a programmable microprocessor is utilized to provide control
        functionality.<br />(10) FIG. 1 shows one embodiment of the present invention
        (a schematic representation of a LED flashlight 100) having a case 110, a
        battery 120 or other portable DC power supply, a power supply and control
        circuit 130, a switch circuit 140, a plurality of LEDs 150, and optionally
        a feedback circuit 160.<br />(11) In various embodiments of the present invention,
        feedback circuit 160 (and similarly the other feedback circuits described
        herein) controls pulse width and/or frequency as a function of parameters
        such as battery voltage, LED light output intensity, power dissipation or
        device temperature, or LED color spectrum output.<br />(12) Case 110 is any
        convenient size and shape, and is typically designed to hold the battery,
        provide a suitable grip to be handheld, and provide a housing for the circuitry
        and LEDs. In one embodiment, battery 120 includes one or more cells which
        can be any suitable technology such as alkaline dry cells or rechargeable
        cells. Alternatively, other portable DC electrical power sources can be used
        as desired in place of battery 120. Power supply and control circuit (PSCC)
        130 responds to switch circuit to apply electrical power from battery 120
        to LEDs 150, controlled in order to prevent overloading and premature destruction
        of LEDs 150 while minimizing power dissipation within PSCC 130, thus maximizing
        battery life, providing the desired accuracy or level of the amount of light
        emitted at different battery voltages or other environmental conditions that
        would otherwise vary the light output. Switch circuit 140 allows the user
        to control various flashlight functions such as, for example, on/off, setting
        light level, setting light color, setting pulse or strobe frequency, and checking
        battery voltage or remaining power. In one embodiment, PSCC 130 provides a
        pulse train, in which pulse frequency, pulse width, or pulse shape/height,
        and/or the number of LEDs that are driven, is controlled in order to provide
        a relatively constant light output level even as battery voltage declines
        and power is drained. In one embodiment, feedback 160 measures the light output
        of LEDs 150 (e.g., using a photo diode or other suitable light detecting device)
        and provides a signal that allows PSCC 130 to adjust the light output to a
        desired level (typically providing a constant light output even as battery
        voltage declines as power is drained). In one such embodiment, the width of
        each pulse is adjusted to keep a constant average light output (widening each
        pulse as the intensity of light decreases, in order to obtain a constant light
        output). In one such embodiment, flashlight 100 is used in conjunction with
        a portable video camcorder or other video camera, and feedback 160 measures
        the overall ambient light and provides a signal that allows generation of
        flashlight pulses to compensate for lack of light, in order to provide optimal
        lighting for the video camera. In one such embodiment, the pulses to the LEDs
        are synchronized to the video camera frame rate using optional pulse synchronization
        (sync) signal 170 in order that the light pulse from LEDs 150 is only on when
        the video camera shutter is collecting light (avoiding light output when the
        camera will not benefit from it). In another embodiment, feedback 160 measures
        battery voltage, and increases pulse width, frequency, or height as battery
        voltage or power declines. In yet another embodiment, feedback 160 measures
        the current going through LEDs 150, and makes the appropriate adjustment to
        pulse width or frequency in order to maintain constant or desired light output.<br
        />(13) FIG. 2 is a schematic of one embodiment of a circuit used for flashlight
        100. In this embodiment, normally open, momentary contact switch 146 is momentarily
        closed by a user to activate light output. Power-switch circuit 132 (in one
        embodiment, a TK 114 circuit by Toko America available from Digikey Corporation
        of Thief River Falls, Minn.) is turned on as its control input 131 is shorted
        to ground by switch 146, thus applying voltage to Vout, which is applied through
        resistor divider 138-138 to transistor 136. In other embodiments, circuit
        132 is replaced by a simple slide switch as is used in conventional flashlights,
        and which, when closed, connects Vin to Vout (eliminating the need for resistors
        137, 138, and 139, switch 146, and transistor 136). Transistor 136 and resistor
        137 then maintain the control voltage low enough to keep power circuit 132
        turned on even after switch 146 is released by the user to its open position
        (transistor 136 is &quot;on&quot; as long as circuit 132 is on and applying
        battery voltage to Vout). Thus power is applied to Vout until an OFF signal
        is set high on line 131 by microprocessor (MP) 134 (resistor 137 has a resistance
        that is set to a value that is small enough to keep the control pin of circuit
        132 low unless overridden by the OFF signal from MP 134 going high). Microprocessor
        134 is any suitable microprocessor, such as a PIC16C62X microcontroller by
        Microchip and available from Digikey Corp. of Thief River Falls, Minn., 56701.
        The PIC16C62X includes two analog comparators with a programmable on-chip
        voltage reference, a timer, and 13 input/output (I/O) pins each capable of
        direct LED driving of 25 mA source or sink. In one embodiment, MP 134 is programmed
        to receive a feedback signal 260 from feedback circuit 160, and on the basis
        of the feedback signal, adjust the drive signal(s) 250 to LEDs 150, thus adjusting
        the light output. In one such embodiment, a lookup table 234 is used to convert
        a digital value derived from feedback signal 260 into a digital value used
        to control drive signal 250. In one embodiment, optional feature switches
        142 are provided to control various parameters of light output such as, for
        example, intensity, color, duration (i.e., time until automatic power down),
        frequency (i.e., a strobe control), etc. In one embodiment, an external pulse
        sync signal 170 is provided, isolated though a standard opto-isolator circuit
        171, and provided as an input to pulse sync input pin 270) of MP 134. In one
        such embodiment, pulse sync signal 170 is driven from a video camera (such
        as a camcorder or a machine-vision video camera), in order to synchronize
        light output with the light gathering/shutter open times of the camera. In
        another such embodiment, pulse sync signal 170 is driven from a spark-plug-wire
        pickup in order to provide a timing strobe of light pulses for tuning an internal
        combustion engine.<br />(14) In one embodiment, feature switches 142 include
        momentary contact switches in pairs, one switch of the pair used to increase
        a particular parameter, and the other switch of the pair used to decrease
        the particular parameter (such as is done commonly in television remote control
        devices). In one such embodiment, a pair of switches increases/decreases overall
        light output intensity. In another such embodiment, color is adjusted, e.g.,
        using one pair of buttons for blue LED output, another pair for green LED
        output, and a third pair for red LED output; or using one pair to control
        the X-coordinate and another pair to control the Y-coordinate of chromaticity
        (such as a CIE chromaticity diagram''s X and Y coordinates). In yet another
        such embodiment, a pair of switch buttons increases/decreases the remaining
        timeout value. In one embodiment, as a feature switch is pressed to increase
        or decrease a parameter, the number of LEDs that are &quot;on&quot; are varied
        to provide a visual indication to the user of the value of that parameter,
        for example the timeout value could be varied from one to ten minutes until
        power off, and as the button to increase that parameter is held down, the
        timeout parameter is increased successively from one to ten, and a corresponding
        number of LEDs (one to ten) are turned on to provide this visual indication.
        In other embodiments, audible indications of such parameters are provided,
        e.g., by providing variable pitch or numbers of clicks to give the user feedback
        as to the value of the parameters being adjusted or measured.<br />(15) A
        primary feature of some embodiments of the present invention is to provide
        a large number of individual LEDs in order to provide sufficient generalized
        and/or focussed illumination to be useful as a handheld flashlight, or in
        particular, as an illumination source for a scene or object to be imaged by
        a video camera (e.g., in a camcorder or machine-vision system). With current
        low-cost, high intensity LEDs having a luminous intensity of, say 2 cd, twenty
        to fifty LEDs are typically needed to provide a good flashlight, although
        in some applications as few as seven LEDs provide desirable results. In one
        such embodiment, each individual LED is separately packaged in a transparent
        encapsulant (e.g., a T 13/4 package) that provides manufacturing efficiencies
        and provides better heat dissipation by spreading the active light emitting
        chips apart from one another. In some embodiments, white LEDs are used (such
        as white LEDs that utilize a blue LED chip and a YAG phosphor that converts
        a portion of the blue light to yellow, thus yielding a white-appearing light
        output, such as part number NSPW 310AS available from Nichia Chemical<br />(16)  Industries
        Ltd. of Japan and Nichia America Corp., 3775 Hempland Road, Mountville Pa.,
        17554). In other embodiments, standard high-efficiency colored LEDs of red,
        yellow, green, and/or blue are used to provide light of the desired intensity
        and color. In one such embodiment, LEDs of each color are controlled separately
        in order to provide the desired overall hue or whiteness of the combined light
        output. In one embodiment, surface-mount LEDs are used.<br />(17) In an application
        such as providing illumination for a video camera, feedback circuit 160 measures
        the video output signal from the camera and provides a feedback signal 260
        that allows adjustment of the light output pf LEDs 150 in order to optimize
        the video signal In one such embodiment, as shown in FIG. 5, the controlled
        LED light source is integrated into a handheld camcorder 500. In one such
        embodiment, the video camera circuit also provides pulse sync signal 170 in
        order to synchronize the light output to the video light gathering time windows.
        In another such embodiment, feedback circuit 160 measures the color balance
        of the video output signal, and provides separate feedback intensity control
        for each of a plurality of (e.g., two or three) separate groups of color LEDs,
        for example, red, green, and blue. In one embodiment, green LEDs such as part
        number NSPG 500S and blue LEDs such as part number NSPB 500S, both available
        from Nichia Chemical Industries Ltd. of Japan and Nichia America Corp., 3775
        Hempland Road, Mountville Pa., 17554 are used, and red LEDs such as part number
        HLMP-C115 available from Hewlett Packard Company.<br />(18) FIG. 3 a circuit
        block diagram of an LED flashlight circuit 300, which circuit is used in some
        embodiments of LED flashlight 100 of FIG. 1 or LED light source in video camera
        500 of FIG. 5. Circuit 331 replaces circuit 132 and 134 of FIG. 2 using similar
        circuit concepts (however, in one embodiment, the entire circuitry of circuit
        331 is integrated onto a single integrated circuit chip). When switch 146
        is momentarily closed, circuit 331 draws output pin 332 low, turning on PNP
        transistor 133, which remains turned on until circuit 331 again detects that
        switch 146 is momentarily closed, at which time pin 332 is allowed to float
        high, turning off the flashlight circuit 300. One or more output pins 336
        drive one or more low-threshold high-power MOSFETs 350 (e.g., a plurality
        of MOSFETs 350 are used to drive groups of LEDs of different colors, as described
        above). In some embodiments, pin 336 provides a variable pulse control signal
        to vary pulse width, pulse frequency, or both in order to control light output
        as described above. In the embodiment shown, output pin 333 is driven low
        to turn on LED 152, and in one such embodiment, pulses LED 152 in a manner
        that the pulses are perceptible to the human eye, and varying the pulse pattern
        or timing in order to indicate the estimated remaining battery power. For
        example, in one embodiment, from one to ten short, individually perceptible
        pulses closely spaced (e.g., one-third of a second apart) pulses are driven
        each time the flashlight is initially turned on, that is, ten pulses closely
        spaced indicate that 100% of the battery power remains, 9 pulses indicate
        that 90% of the battery power remains, . . . and 1 pulse indicates that 10%
        of the battery power remains. In another such embodiment, LED 152 is repeated
        pulsed in this manner, e.g., ten pulses spaced at 1/3 second, then a 3 second
        period of time when LED 152 is off, ten pulses spaced at 1/3 second, then
        a 3 second period of time when LED 152 is off, in a repeating pattern as long
        as the flashlight is on. In one such embodiment, this provides the user with
        the only indication of remaining battery life, since LEDs 151 are driven to
        provide constant illumination, regardless of battery voltage variations or
        other factors that would otherwise vary light output. In other embodiments,
        feedback circuit 160 is omitted, and such factors do affect light output.
        Feedback circuit 160 is as described above, and measures light emitted by
        the LEDs, battery voltage, LED current, and/or other parameters in order to
        provide circuit 331 with information to be used to control output pin 336,
        and thus light output. In one embodiment that measures light output in feedback
        circuit 160, the width of the pulse needed to obtain a certain level of light
        output provides indirect information regarding remaining battery power, and
        is measured and converted into the visual indication of remaining power to
        be displayed by LED 152. In another embodiment, the amount of remaining battery
        power is visually indicated by turning on a proportional number of the LEDs
        151 as power is initially applied, so the user, by seeing how many LEDs are
        lit during this initial power-indication mode, can determine the remaining
        battery power. Thus, by varying the number of perceptible flashes or the number
        of lit LEDs, or other visual indication, the remaining battery power can be
        conveyed to the user.<br />(19) FIG. 4 a circuit block diagram of an LED flashlight
        circuit 400, which circuit is used in some embodiments of LED flashlight 100
        of FIG. 1 or LED light source in video camera 500 of FIG. 5. In this circuit
        400, switch 147 applies (and removes) power to the circuit 400. In this embodiment,
        circuit 433 provides a continuous series of very short pulses (e.g., 10 microseconds
        wide each) at a frequency much higher than the flicker rate of the human eye
        (e.g., between 100 Hz to 50 KHz) that drive the trigger input of circuit 434
        (in this embodiment, circuits 433 and 434 are each 555-type timer circuits,
        or each are one-half of a 556 dual timer). Resistor 431 and constant voltage
        circuit 432 provide a fixed voltage to control pin 5 of circuit 555. Since
        circuit 434 will operate over a wide range of voltage, as the voltage of Vout
        decreases, the constant voltage at pin 5 (from circuit 432) will be relatively
        higher, thus increasing the pulse width generated by circuit 434 and output
        on its pin 3. As in FIG. 3, MOSFET 350 shorts the anodes of LEDs 151 to ground
        for the duration that pulse from circuit 434 is high. This can provide 100
        milliamps or more through each LED 151 when the battery is fully charged,
        but only for a very short pulse. While the 100 mA, if constant, would overload
        the ILEDs, the short pulses are tolerated. As the battery power is drained,
        the voltage of Vout decreases, and the pulse width increases. In this way,
        pulse width increases as battery voltage decreases, thus compensating at least
        partially for the reduced peak intensity of the LEDs at lower voltage. On
        the other hand, LED 452 is driven directly from output pin 3 of circuit 434
        though current limiting resistor 153. LEDs 151 are &quot;on&quot; for proportionally
        longer as the pulse width increases, however, LED 452 is on proportionally
        shorter as pulse width increases, thus LED 452 becomes dimmer as voltage decreases,
        providing a visual indication of remaining battery power.<br />(20) FIG. 5
        is a diagram showing a controlled LED light source is integrated into a handheld
        camcorder 500. In this embodiment, camcorder 500 includes lens 520, case 510,
        video circuit 570, recorder apparatus 580, battery 120, control circuit 130,
        feedback circuit 160, and LEDs 150. Typically, lens 520 forms an image of
        object 599 onto a CCD imaging array that is part of video circuit 570 (i.e.,
        lens 520 and video circuit 570 form a video camera), and the corresponding
        video signal is recorded onto media (such as video tape or recordable digital
        video disk (DVD)) in recorder 580. In other applications such as machine vision,
        the video signal is coupled to an image processor that in turn controls some
        manufacturing process, for example, and part inspection or robot arm control
        is accomplished. In one embodiment, feedback circuit 160 takes input from
        the video signal only in order to control the amount of light emitted from
        LEDs 150. In other embodiments, feedback circuit 160, instead of or in addition
        to input from the video signal, takes feedback input 165 from a photosensor
        in order to control LED light output.<br />(21) FIG. 6 is a graph of color
        spectrum versus current for an LED to be used in one embodiment of the present
        invention. As is seen in the graph, as the LED current increases from 10 mA
        to 35 mA, the color spectrum of this exemplary LED shifts from centered at
        approximately 440 nanometers (blue) to centered at approximately at 380 nanometers
        (ultraviolet), and the overall intensity increases with increasing current.
        Such an LED is described by M Schauler et al, GaN based LED''s with different
        recombination zones, MSR Internet Journal of Nitride Research, Volume 2 Article
        44, Oct. 8, 1997 (internet address http://nsr.mij.mrs.org/2/44/complete.html).
        In one such embodiment, the above described pulse-width control or frequency
        control circuits (such as feedback circuit 160 and control circuit 134) are
        used to maintain a desired illumination intensity as the color spectrum is
        changed by changing the current through the LED. In one such embodiment, color
        balance as measured by feedback circuit 160 is used to change the current
        of each pulse and thus the color spectrum in order to control or maintain
        color balance.<br />(22) By controlling the amount of current (the height
        of each pulse), the color spectrum of the output light can be adjusted (i.e.,
        for the above described LED, the color spectrum center wavelength is adjustable
        from 440 nm blue to 380 nm ultraviolet), and by simultaneously controlling
        pulse width and/or pulse frequency, the intensity can also be controlled (i.e.,
        one can vary the intensity, or even keep a constant intensity as the pulse
        height is adjusted to change color output), e.g., by varying pulse width to
        provide a constant perceived or average intensity even as the color changes.
        FIG. 7 shows one circuit 700 to accomplish such control. The user controls
        the color desired via switches 140 coupled to control circuit 730. Circuit
        730 then controls the current of transistor 755 by well-known techniques such
        as a current mirror, and the pulse width or frequency to transistor 750 as
        described above (in one embodiment, a lookup table is used to choose a predetermined
        pulse width based on the user-selected or set color, and the current is determined
        by another corresponding lookup table is used to choose an appropriate current).<br
        />(23) FIG. 8 shows another circuit 800 to accomplish such control. Feedback
        circuit 840 is adjusted to controls the color desired based on a detected
        color signal from color detector 841 in control circuit 830. Control circuit
        830 then controls the current of transistor 755 by a current mirror with transistor
        754. In addition, the pulse width or frequency to gated register 842 is optionally
        controlled by one or more feedback circuits 860 (which is controlled by a
        signal indicating supply voltage, tile temperature of LEDs 151, measured light
        output intensity or any other parameter over which control is desired) as
        described above (in one embodiment, a lookup table is used to choose a predetermined
        pulse width based on the user-selected or set color, and the current is determined
        by another corresponding lookup table is used to choose an appropriate current).
        In one embodiment, gated register 842 receives and stores a binary number
        value from feedback circuit 840, and receives a variable-frequency and/or
        variable-width output-enable pulse 835 from pulse-width modulator (PWM) circuit
        834. PWM circuit 834 is driven by frequency generator 833. In one embodiment,
        both PWM circuit 834 and frequency generator 833 are set to provide fixed
        frequency and fixed width pulses (i.e., no feedback used). In other embodiments,
        one or both of frequency and pulse width are variable, and in some embodiments,
        the variability is controlled by feedback, and in other embodiments these
        parameters are set-able to values chosen by a user. In some embodiments, a
        maximum frequency for a given pulse width, or a maximum pulse width for a
        given frequency is predetermined in order to prevent destruction of LEDs 151
        from excessive power. In other embodiments, a temperature feedback signal
        indicating the temperature of LEDs 151 is coupled to feedback circuit 860
        to prevent overheating of LEDs 151. In some embodiments, Feedback circuit
        860 simply inhibits and/or shortens pulses based on temperature feedback or
        on a predetermined maximum rate limit or pulse-width limit. FET transistors
        851, 852, 853, and 854, and their respective resistors R, 2R, 4R, and 8R,
        along with trimming resistor 859 form a controllable variable current source,
        which is multiplied by approximately the factor .beta./(.beta.+2) by the current
        mirror of transistors 754 and 755 to get the sum of the current though LEDs
        151. For optimal results, transistors 754 and 755 are formed as s single integrated
        three-terminal device on a single substrate, in order to achieve matched betas
        and temperature dependence. In one such embodiment, transistor 755 is formed
        of multiple individual transistors wired in parallel in order to achieve higher
        output current (at the collector of transistor 755) for a given input current
        (at the collector of transistor 754 and the bases of the two transistors).
        In the embodiment shown, this current mirror allows circuit 830 to determine
        the current through transistor 755 substantially independent of the voltage
        of Vcc and the voltage-current relationships of LEDs 151. In the embodiment
        shown, LEDs 151 are wired in parallel, however, in other embodiments a single
        LED device is used, or a plurality of LEDs 151 are instead wired in series,
        or in a series-parallel arrangement as is shown in FIG. 10.<br />(24) FIG.
        9 is a graph of color spectrum (photoluminescence) versus temperature for
        an LED to be used in one embodiment of the present invention. Such an LED
        is described by B. Monemar et al, Free Excitons in GaN, MSR Internet Journal
        of Nitride Research, Volume 1 Article 2, Jul. 8, 1996 (internet address http://nsr.mij.mrs.org/1/2/complete.html).
        In one embodiment of the present invention, a GaN or InGaN LED that exhibits
        a temperature-dependent color spectrum light output (i.e., electroluminescence,
        or light output due to a current flowing through the LED which also exhibits
        color-temperature dependence, as opposed to the photoluminescence graphed
        in FIG. 9) has its color spectrum controlled by one of the circuits described
        for FIGS. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, or 8. In one such embodiment, feedback reduces
        or eliminates color changes that would otherwise occur as temperature of the
        LED changed. In another such embodiment, color changes are purposely induced
        by changing the temperature of the LED, either by heating or cooling the LED
        with an external temperature-change device such as a resistor, or by inducing
        internal temperature changes by changing the average driving current to effect
        a change in junction temperature in the LED. In some such embodiments, a color
        detector such as are well known in the art is used to provide a signal to
        provide feedback to control temperature.<br />(25) FIG. 10 is a block diagram
        of the control circuit 130 for one embodiment of illumination system 100.
        An Oscillator 15 (in the embodiment shown, oscillator 15 is part of an image
        processor as shown which is coupled to an electronic camera 14, e.g., a charge-coupled
        device (CCD)), controlled by pulse-frequency circuit (such as circuit 833
        of FIG. 8 or frequency generator 433 of FIG. 4), sends a trigger signal to
        power supply 20. In one embodiment, the image processor 15 generates one pulse
        or a plurality of pulses for each CCD frame, wherein the number of pulses
        generated is sufficient to provide a desired accumulation of light received
        by camera 14 for each frame. Within power supply 20, the trigger signal activates
        pulse generator 201 to generate a control pulse of a length determined by
        pulse-length circuit (such as PWM circuit 834 of FIG. 8 or PWM 434 of FIG.
        4) The control pulse is used to turn on transistor Q1 to generate a flash
        on LEDs 25, which is current-limited by resistor R3. The control pulse also
        activates the maximum-rate-limit circuit 202, which inhibits any further control
        pulses from pulse generator 201 for a predetermined amount of time. The 12
        volt signal from power supply 20 is filtered by the low-pass filter comprising
        C1, L1, D1, and R1, and charges capacitors C2 through C.sub.N (in one embodiment,
        N is 12). In one such embodiment, C1 through C12 are each 2200 .mu.F, L1 is
        40 .mu.H iron-core, D1 as a 1N4001 diode, and R1 is a 0 ohm conductor. C2
        through C.sub.N are discharged through fifteen series-wired LEDs 25, which
        in this embodiment are wired in a parallel-series manner as shown, and R3
        and Q1, as activated by the above-described control pulse. In one such embodiment,
        R3 is replaced by a zero-ohm conductor, and the voltage drop across the LEDs
        and Q1 is used to self-limit the current through the LEDs. The control pulse
        is fed across resistor R2, which in one embodiment is 100 K.OMEGA., to develop
        the necessary voltage for driving transistor Q1, which in this embodiment
        is a MTP75N05HD MOSFET.<br />(26) FIG. 11 is a more-detailed schematic diagram
        of power supply 20. The input trigger is fed through resistor R2 to drive
        the input of opto-isolator OI1. The output of opto-isolator OI1 is coupled
        through capacitor C12 (and the associated circuit R4, R6 and D2) to the TRG
        input of timer circuit 1C1.sub.A. (In one embodiment, timers 1C1.sub.A and
        1C1.sub.B are each 1/2 of a 556-type dual timer.) The timing constant of timer
        1C1.sub.A is set by C14 and R1-x, (where x is selected from 1 through N),
        and determines<br />(27)  the pulse width of the control pulse driving Q1,
        and thus the LEDs. In one embodiment, five selectable pulse widths are predetermined
        and selected by SW1, which is a five-way exclusive dual-pole-single-throw
        switch, wherein one resistor of the set R1-1 through R1-N is selected for
        connection to the DIS input pin of 1C1.sub.A, and a corresponding one resistor
        of the set R2-1 through R2-N is selected for connection to the DIS input pin
        of 1C1.sub.B. The timing constant of timer 1C1.sub.B is set by C17 and R2-x,
        (where x is selected from 1 through N), and determines the minimum time between
        control pulses driving Q1, and thus the LEDs. In one embodiment, the five
        selectable predetermined pulse widths are 25 microseconds (.mu.s), 50 .mu.s,
        100 .mu.s, 200 .mu.s and 500 .mu.s; the corresponding maximum pulse rates
        controlled by maximum rate limit circuit 202 are 200 Hz, 120 Hz, 60 Hz, 30
        Hz, and 10 Hz, respectively, and are predetermined and selected by SW1. Thus,
        in the embodiment which uses a 60 Hz camera image rate, 100 .mu.s-long control
        pulses are used to activate LEDs 25. In one embodiment, it is desired to have
        an average LED illumination intensity of at least ten times the ambient light;
        thus, when imaging device 14 is taking one frame every 16.7 milliseconds,
        a 100 microsecond pulse should be at least 1670 times as intense as the ambient
        light. In one such an embodiment, a shroud is used to reduce the ambient light,
        and a red filter (substantially transparent to the peak wavelength of illumination
        source 18) is placed over the lens of imaging device 14 in order to reduce
        ambient light and pass the light of illumination source 18. The control pulse
        output signal is driven through resistor R3.<br />(28) In one embodiment,
        opto-isolator OI1 is a 4N37-type part, resistor R2 is 100.OMEGA. resistor
        R3 is 100.OMEGA., resistor R7 is 1 M.OMEGA., resistor R8 is 1 K.OMEGA. and
        visible-color LED D3 indicates when the circuit is active, resistor R4 is
        4700.OMEGA., resistor R5 is 10.OMEGA., resistor R6 is 10 K.OMEGA., diode D2
        is a 1N914, resistor R1-1 is 2.26 K.OMEGA., resistor R1-2 is 4.53 K.OMEGA.,
        resistor R1-3 is 9.1 K.OMEGA., resistor R1-4 is 18.2 K.OMEGA., resistor R1-5
        is 45.3 K.OMEGA., resistor R2-1 is 37.4 K.OMEGA., resistor R2-2 is 75 K.OMEGA.,
        resistor R2-3 is 150 K.OMEGA., resistor R2-4 is 301 K.OMEGA., resistor R2-5
        is 909 K.OMEGA., C14 is 0.01 .mu.F, C17 is 0.1 .mu.F, C12 is 0.001 .mu.F,
        C10 is 100 .mu.F, C11 is 0.1 .mu.F, C13, C15, and C16 are each 0.01 .mu.F,
        Q2 and Q3 are each 2N3904 NPN transistors, and RP1 is a 10 K.OMEGA. resistor
        pack.<br />(29) In one embodiment such as shown in FIG. 5 of FIG. 10, the
        image detector (i.e., video imager circuit 590 or CCD Camera 14, respectively)
        is shuttered (in one embodiment, electronic shuttering of a CCD array is performed)
        in order to shorten the time period used to accumulate light for each frame
        image. In one such embodiment, the camera shutter is &quot;open&quot; for
        a period of only about 30 microseconds (in other embodiments, for shorter
        periods such as 10 microseconds or 1 microsecond), and the LED illumination
        source 150 is activated synchronously, in order to minimize the amount of
        ambient light received, and to maximize the amount of light received from
        LED source 150. In one such embodiment, this allows improved detection of
        objects of interest such as objects that reflect, absorb, or fluoresce from
        the wavelength(s) of light from LED illumination source 150 differently than
        do surrounding objects, but that are difficult to distinguish in ambient light.
        Examples are taggents having colors that show up best when illuminated with
        certain wavelengths, e.g., fluorescing materials. Further, such embodiments
        reduce the problem of achieving a high ratio of LED light to ambient light.<br
        />(30) In the present invention, a longer battery life (or more efficient
        use of a wall-powered DC source) is achieved because (1) the LED light output
        is synchronized with the camera shutter (or other light receiver) thus reducing
        the amount of wasted light. In some embodiments, the LEDs are operated an
        an operating point that provides the most light output per unit of power input,
        using pulse width or frequency to adjust the total light output to a desired
        level.<br />(31) In one embodiment of FIG. 5, the plurality of LED colors
        are sequentially and separately pulsed (e.g., a red pulse, then a green pulse,
        then a blue pulse), and a single wide-spectrum feedback detector and circuit
        is used to separately adjust each of the colors of output LED light. This
        provides the ability to color balance with a lower cost than having a color
        detector that needs to differentiate three colors from a single light pulse
        having all colors. In one embodiment, a color spectrum of a single LED or
        set of LEDs is adjusted (e.g., by varying the LED current and pulse width)
        in order to tune the color to better detect certain objects (e.g., the timing
        mark on a grimy gas engine, or objects in a fog).<br />(32) In one embodiment,
        surface-mount LEDs are used.<br />(33) It is to be understood that the above
        description is intended to be illustrative, and not restrictive. Many other
        embodiments will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reviewing the
        above description. The scope of the invention should, therefore, be determined
        with reference to the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents
        to which such claims are entitled.","claimsHtml":"1. A flashlight, comprising:<br

        FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br />(2) This invention relates to the field of lighting,
        and more specifically to a method and apparatus of controlling and powering
        a solid-state light source such as a light-emitting diode or LED, for a portable
        battery-powered flashlight.<br />(3) BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br />(4)
        There is a widespread need for hand-held flashlights and lanterns. One common
        flashlight includes a two-cell battery for power, an incandescent lamp to
        emit light, and a simple single-pole switch to connect and disconnect the
        battery to the lamp. Other flashlights use other numbers of battery cells
        in order to provide a voltage suitable for various particular conditions.
        Lanterns often use a fluorescent tube to emit light. Certain keychain fobs
        use a pair of hearing-aid cells and a red-light light-emitting diode (LED)
        in order to provide short-range lighting such as might be -needed to find
        a keyhole in the dark.<br />(5) Battery technology is such that as electrical
        power is withdrawn from a battery cell, the voltage available across a given
        current load will decrease. This decreased available voltage across the given
        load causes reduced light output, gradually dimming the light as the battery
        charge depletes.<br />(6) Further, LEDs have voltage, current, and power parameters
        that must be controlled in order to maximize device life. Commonly, a current-limiting
        resistor is placed in series with an LED in order that only a portion of the
        voltage drop from the battery is across the LED and the rest of the voltage
        drop is across the resistor. This voltage drop and corresponding power loss
        in the resistor is dissipated as waste heat, which is inefficient for a flashlight
        which should be designed to emit light.<br />(7) In addition, it is awkward
        or difficult to determine the amount of remaining charge in a battery cell,
        generally requiring removal of the battery from the flashlight in order to
        measure the remaining charge. In addition, the cost of a separate measurement
        device can be a negative for this market. Some battery cells today include
        a built-in liquid-crystal indicator for the charge in the cell, but such a
        solution requires a separate measurement device/indicator for each battery,
        and requires removal of the battery from the flashlight in order to perform
        the measurement and observe the indication of remaining power.<br />(8) SUMMARY
        OF THE INVENTION<br />(9) The present invention provides a method and apparatus
        for an L.E.D. flashlight or other LED illumination source. In one embodiment,
        a flashlight is described. The flashlight includes a flashlight housing suitable

        The flashlight also includes a first electrical circuit that selectively applies
        power from the DC voltage source to the LED units, wherein the flashlight
        is of such compact size and low weight as to be suitable for single-handed
        portable operation by a user, the flashlight further having a purpose of providing
        general-purpose illumination.<br />(10) In one embodiment, the LED optical
        axes of the first plurality of LED units in the flashlight are substantially
        parallel to one another. In one such embodiment, the flashlight further includes

        LED units that each emit light and have a reflector for collimating the emitted

        equal to one another, and different than the optical spread angle of the first
        plurality of LED units.<br />(12) In yet another embodiment, the LED units

        further includes a control circuit for maintaining a predetermined light output
        level of the LED units as a charge on the battery cell varies. In one such
        embodiment, the control circuit maintains an average predetermined light output
        level of the LED units as the charge on the battery cell varies by increasing
        a pulse width or a pulse frequency as the charge on the battery cell decreases.
        In another such embodiment, the control circuit maintains an average predetermined
        light output level of the LED units by measuring a battery voltage and adjusting
        a pulse width or a pulse frequency or both to maintain the average light output
        at the predetermined level. In still another such embodiment, the control
        circuit maintains an average predetermined light output level of the LED units
        by measuring an average light output and adjusting a pulse width or a pulse
        frequency or both to maintain the measured average light output at the predetermined
        level.<br />(14) Another aspect of the present invention provides a flashlight
        including: (a) a flashlight housing, the housing being suitable for at least
        one of receiving therein and mounting thereon at least one DC voltage source
        that includes at least one battery cell; (b) a light-emitting diode (LED)
        housing connected to the flashlight housing, the LED housing including one
        or more first LED units that each emit light and have a reflector for collimating

        and (c) a first electrical circuit that selectively applies power from the
        DC voltage source to the LED units, the first electrical circuit further including
        a control circuit for maintaining a predetermined light output level of the
        LED units as a charge on the battery cell varies; wherein the flashlight is
        of such compact size and low weight as to be suitable for single-handed portable
        operation by a user, the flashlight further having a purpose of providing
        general-purpose illumination.<br />(15) In one such embodiment, the first
        LED units being a first plurality of LED units, wherein the LED optical axes

        In another such embodiment, the flashlight further includes a second plurality
        of LED units that each emit light and have a reflector for collimating the
        emitted light forwardly therefrom generally along an LED optical axis, wherein
        the LED optical axes of the second plurality of LED units converge or diverge
        from one another forwardly from the housing.<br />(16) In another such embodiment,
        the first LED units are a first plurality of LED units, wherein an optical
        spread angle of the first plurality of LED units are substantially equal to
        one another. In yet another such embodiment, the flashlight further includes
        a second plurality of LED units that each emit light and have a reflector
        for collimating the emitted light forwardly therefrom generally along an LED
        optical axis, wherein an optical spread angle of the second plurality of LED
        units are substantially equal to one another, and different than the optical
        spread angle of the first plurality of LED units.<br />(17) Another aspect
        of the present invention provides a method of providing general-purpose illumination
        of such compact size and low weight as to be suitable for single-handed portable
        operation by a user, including the steps of: (a) providing one or more first

        light forwardly therefrom generally along an LED optical axis; (b) selectively
        applying power from a DC voltage source to the LED units; and (c) maintaining
        a predetermined light output level of the LED units as a charge on the battery
        cell varies by controlling the step (b).<br />(18) In one embodiment, the
        step of maintaining maintains an average predetermined light output level
        of the LED units as the charge on the battery cell, varies by increasing a
        pulse energy or a pulse frequency as the charge on the battery cell decreases.
        In another embodiment, the step of maintaining maintains an average predetermined
        light output level of the LED units by measuring a battery voltage and adjusting

        is maintained is light output intensity. In another such embodiment, the control
        circuit maintains the light output intensity of the LED units as the voltage
        of the DC voltage source varies by increasing a pulse width, a pulse energy,
        or a pulse frequency as the voltage of the DC voltage source decreases. In
        another such embodiment, the control circuit maintains an average predetermined
        light output level of the LED units by measuring a voltage and adjusting a
        pulse energy or a pulse frequency or both to maintain the average light output
        at the predetermined level. In yet another such embodiment, the control circuit

        output. In another such embodiment, the one or more LEDs comprise one or more
        LEDs having a characteristic color spectrum output that varies based on applied
        current, and the control circuit controls a pulse current in order to control
        the characteristic color spectrum output.<br />(23) Yet another aspect of
        the present invention provides an illumination source that includes (a) a
        light-emitting diode (LED) housing including one or more LEDs; and (b) a control
        circuit that selectively applies power from a source of electric power to
        the LEDs to adjust a light output color spectrum of the one or more LEDs.","backgroundTextHtml":null,"subHeadingM0Html":null,"subHeadingM1Html":null,"subHeadingM2Html":null,"subHeadingM3Html":null,"subHeadingM4Html":null,"subHeadingM5Html":null,"subHeadingM6Html":null,"usClassIssued":"362/184","issuedUsDigestRefClassifi":null,"datePublYear":"2000","applicationYear":"1998","pfDerwentWeekYear":null,"pfApplicationYear":null,"pfPublYear":null,"reissueApplNumber":null,"abstractHeader":null,"abstractedPublicationDerwent":null,"affidavit130BFlag":null,"affidavit130BText":null,"applicantGroup":null,"applicantHeader":null,"applicationFilingDateInt":19980319,"applicationFilingDateIntKwicHits":null,"applicationRefFilingType":null,"applicationReferenceGroup":null,"applicationSeriesAndNumber":null,"applicationSeriesCode":"09","assignee1":null,"assigneeDescriptiveText":["N/A"],"patentAssigneeTerms":null,"associateAttorneyName":null,"attorneyName":null,"biologicalDepositInformation":null,"applicationType":null,"unlinkedDerwentRegistryNumber":null,"unlinkedRingIndexNumbersRarerFragments":null,"claimStatement":"What
