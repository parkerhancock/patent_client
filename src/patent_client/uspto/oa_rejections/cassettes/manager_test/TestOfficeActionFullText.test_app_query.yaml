      33, 40, and 42 are rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable
      over Del Bigio et al (US 2009/0048582), and further in view of Odland (US 6,537,241)
      and Fowle (US 5,324,286).\\nIn regards to claim 33, Del Bigio et al teaches
      a system (Figure 7) for removing a fluid from a tissue site, comprising:\\nan
      inbound conduit (inflow tubing [7]) for placement proximate to the tissue site
      \\na treatment-fluid delivery unit (reservoir of dialysis fluid) adapted to
      be fluidly coupled to the inbound conduit for delivering a treatment fluid (dialysis
      fluid) to the inbound conduit (paragraph [0041])\\nan outbound conduit (outflow
      tubing [7]) for placement proximate to the tissue site, the outbound conduit
      fluidly coupled to the inbound conduit \\na treatment-fluid collector (waste
      reservoir) adapted to be fluidly coupled to the outbound conduit for receiving
      the treatment fluid and a recruited fluid from the tissue site (paragraph [0041])\\nwherein
      the treatment fluid is hyperosmotic (hyperosmolar) with respect to the tissue
      site (Abstract)\\n Del Bigio et al is silent about whether the inbound conduit
      and the outbound conduit are semi-permeable, as Del Bigio et al only states
      an osmotic cell with semipermeable membrane [6] between the inbound conduit
      and the outbound conduit (Figure 7). Odland teaches a system (Figures 26-27)
      comprising a semi-permeable inbound conduit (second lumen [230]) and a semi-permeable
      outbound conduit (semipermeable membranes [232]). It would have been obvious
      to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made
      to modify the inbound conduit and the outbound conduit, of the system of Del
      Bigio et al, to be semi-permeable, as taught by Odland, as such will provide
      further areas in addition to the osmotic cell for site specific microdialysis
      for recovering fluid from the tissue site and will provide an optimal combination
      of properties such as mass transfer properties and biocompatibility (Abstract)(column
      33, lines 16-18). Further, Del Bigio et al does not appear to teach that the
      treatment fluid comprises a dry gas. Fowle teaches a system (Figures 1-3) wherein
      a treatment fluid comprises a dry gas (dry inert gas stream [36]). It would
      have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the
      invention was made to modify the treatment fluid, of the modified system of
      Del Bigio et al and Odland, to comprise a dry gas, as taught by Fowle, as such
      will allow for transporting cryogenic droplets to the distal end of the conduit
      for cooling a cold-tip (Abstract), which can be manipulated to destroy a small
      amount of brain tissue (the thalamus) by freezing it (column 1, lines 13-19).\\n\\tIn
      regards to claim 40, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and
      Fowle, Del Bigio et al teaches a conduit interface (osmotic cell with semipermeable
      membrane [6]) for coupling the inbound conduit and the outbound conduit; however,
      Del Bigio et al does not teach that the conduit interface comprises a plurality
      of tributary conduits, as Del Bigio et al only  teaches a single conduit [6].
      But it would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art
      at the time the invention was made to modify the conduit interface, of the modified
      system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Fowle, to comprise a plurality of tributary
      conduits, as either configuration between the inbound conduit and the outbound
      conduit will allow for excess water and small molecules to be efficiently drawn
      from the surface of the brain, through osmotic forces, thereby reducing brain
      swelling.\\n\\tIn regards to claim 42, in the modified system of Del Bigio et
      al, Odland, and Fowle, Del Bigio et al teaches an open-cavity (Figure 7), reduced-pressure
      (Abstract) subsystem (mechanical pumping system) for removing fluids from a
      body cavity of a patient (paragraph [0041]).\\n Claims 34-37 are rejected under
      pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Del Bigio et al, Odland,
      and Fowle, as applied to claim 33 above, and further in view of Treu et al (US
      6,254,567).\\nIn regards to claim 34, in the modified system of Del Bigio et
      al, Odland, and Fowle, Del Bigio et al is silent about a recruited-fluid determination
      unit coupled to the treatment-fluid collector for determining a volume of the
      recruited fluid. Treu et al teaches a system (Figure 7) wherein a recruited-fluid
      determination unit (fluid removal module [118]) is coupled to a treatment fluid
      collector (waste module [46]) for determining a volume of a recruited fluid.
      It would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the
      time the invention was made to modify the modified system, of Del Bigio et al,
      Odland, and Fowle, with a recruited-fluid determination unit, as taught by Treu
      et al, as such will provide an efficient means for  monitoring the volume of
      excess fluid removed from the patient in order to aid in balancing the fluid
      level of the patient (column 10, lines 33-45)(column 3, lines 65-67).\\nIn regards
      to claim 35, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Fowle, Del
      Bigio et al is silent about a volume transducer and a treatment controller comprising
      a microprocessor, a memory device, an input device, the volume transducer, and
      an output means. Treu et al teaches a system (Figures 1 and 7) comprising a
      volume transducer (means [124]) for developing a signal indicative of the volume
      of treatment fluid and recruited fluid (column 10, lines 41-45) and a treatment
      controller (processing controller [16]), the treatment controller comprising:
      a microprocessor (column 5, lines 21-22), a memory device associated with the
      microprocessor (column 5, line 38), an input device (interface [50])(input device
      [54]) associated with the microprocessor for receiving input signals, the volume
      transducer coupled to the input device (column 3, lines 65-67), and an output
      means associated with the microprocessor for delivering output signals (column
      5, lines 21-44)(column 10, lines 33-45). It would have been obvious to a person
      having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to modify
      the modified system, of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Fowle, with a volume transducer
      and a treatment controller having a microprocessor, a memory device, an input
      device, the volume transducer, and an output means, as taught by Treu et al,
      as the volume transducer will provide an efficient means for monitoring the
      volume of excess fluid removed from the patient in order to aid in balancing
      the fluid level of the patient (column 10, lines 33-45)(column 3, lines 65-67)
      and the treatment controller will govern the interactions within the system
      by providing the user with the current status of the system, prompting the user
      to input commands and information or receive data from the various sensors and
      other components, recording data in memory,  controlling the operation of the
      active components of the system, or alerting the patient to abnormal or failure
      conditions in the system (column 5, lines 21-44).\\nIn regards to claim 36,
      in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle, and Treu et al, Del
      Bigio et al does not teach a microprocessor and a memory device. Treu et al
      teaches that the microprocessor and the memory device are operable to develop
      a control signal to adjust a flow rate in the treatment-fluid delivery unit
      (column 9, lines 57-62)(column 10, lines 1-7). It would have been obvious to
      a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made
      to modify the modified system, of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle, and Treu et
      al, to adjust a flow rate in the treatment-fluid delivery unit, as taught by
      Treu et al, as adjusting the flow rate will help at least partially maintain
      a normal physiologic fluid and electrolytic balance in the patient (column 9,
      lines 52-54).\\nIn regards to claim 37, in the modified system of Del Bigio
      et al, Odland, Fowle, and Treu et al, Del Bigio et al does not teach that the
      treatment-fluid delivery unit comprises a heating element and the system comprises
      an inbound conduit temperature transducer coupled to the treatment controller.
      Treu et al teaches that the treatment-fluid delivery unit comprises a heating
      element (column 9, lines 4-10). It would have been obvious to a person having
      ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to modify the modified
      system, of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle, and Treu et al, with a heating element,
      as taught by Treu et al, as such will heat the treatment fluid to body temperature
      (column 9, lines 4-10), which will be more comfortable to the patient. However,
      Treu et al is silent about an inbound conduit temperature transducer. But it
      would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the
      time the invention was made to modify the modified system, of Del Bigio et al,
      Odland, Fowle, and  Treu et al, with an inbound conduit temperature transducer,
      as common practice in the art, as such will allow the treatment controller to
      sense and determine whether or not the treatment fluid is at an acceptable temperature,
      such as body temperature, for delivery to the patient. If the treatment fluid
      is not at an acceptable temperature, the treatment controller will direct the
      heating element to operate and regulate the temperature of the treatment fluid.\\n
      Claims 43-46 are rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable
      over Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Fowle, as applied to claim 42 above, and further
      in view of Lockwood et al (US 6,752,794).\\nIn regards to claim 43, in the modified
      system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Fowle, Del Bigio et al is silent about
      whether the open-cavity, reduced-pressure subsystem comprises a treatment device,
      a manifold, a sealing member, a reduced-pressure delivery conduit, and a reduced-pressure
      interface. Lockwood et al teaches a system wherein an open-cavity, reduced-pressure
      subsystem (Figures 1-7) comprises: \\na treatment device comprising:\\na fenestrated
      non-adherent drape (member [20])\\na plurality of encapsulated leg members (channels
      [28]) coupled to the non-adherent drape, each having an interior portion with
      a leg manifold member [28] and formed with fenestrations (holes [36]) operable
      to allow fluid flow into the interior portion \\na central connection member
      (channels [30]) fluidly coupled to the plurality of encapsulated leg members,
      the central connection member having a first side (Figure 4) and a second, patient-facing
      side\\na manifold (vacuum/irrigation tube [13]) for disposing proximate the
      first side of the central connection member and operable to manifold reduced
      pressure to the central connection member \\na sealing member (sealing film
      [62]) for disposing on a portion of the patient\u2019s epidermis and operable
      to form a pneumatic seal over the body cavity\\na reduced-pressure delivery
      conduit (between vacuum source [12] and valve [66])\\na reduced-pressure interface
      (valve [66]) for coupling to the sealing member and operable to fluidly couple
      the reduced-pressure delivery conduit to the manifold\\nIt would have been obvious
      to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made
      to modify the open-cavity, reduced-pressure subsystem, of the modified system
      of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Fowle, to comprise a treatment device, a manifold,
      a sealing member, a reduced-pressure delivery conduit, and a reduced-pressure
      interface, as taught by Lockwood et al, as such will promote the healing of
      a large wound by providing vacuum therapy to the wound to promote blood flow
      and remove exudate from a wound surface of the wound (column 7, lines 54-57).\\n\\tIn
      regards to claim 44, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle,
      and Lockwood et al, Del Bigio et al is silent about a central connection member.
      Lockwood et al teaches that the central connection member has a connection manifold
      member [30] and wherein each leg manifold member is in fluid communication with
      the connection manifold member number='10'(Figure 4). It would have been obvious
      to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made
      to modify the central connection member, of the modified system of Del Bigio
      et al, Odland, Fowle, and Lockwood et al, to have a connection manifold member,
      as taught by Lockwood et al, as such will promote the healing of a large wound
      by providing vacuum therapy to the wound to promote blood flow and remove exudate
      from a wound surface of the wound (column 7, lines 54-57).\\nIn regards to claim
      45, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle, and Lockwood et
      al, Del Bigio et al is silent about the plurality of encapsulated leg members.
      Lockwood et al teaches that the outbound conduit [13] and the inbound conduit
      [13] are coupled to at least one of the plurality of encapsulated leg members
      (Figure 5). It would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in
      the art at the time the invention was made to modify the outbound conduit and
      the inbound conduit, of the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle,
      and Lockwood et al, to be coupled to at least one of the plurality of encapsulated
      leg members, as taught by Lockwood et al, as such will promote the healing of
      a large wound by providing vacuum therapy to the wound to promote blood flow
      and remove exudate from a wound surface of the wound (column 7, lines 54-57).\\nIn
      regards to claim 46, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle,
      and Lockwood et al, Del Bigio et al is silent about the plurality of encapsulated
      leg members. Lockwood et al teaches that each encapsulated leg member of the
      plurality of encapsulated leg members comprises:\\na fenestrated first leg encapsulating
      member [28]\\na fenestrated second leg encapsulating member [28]number='11'\\nwherein
      the leg manifold member has a first side, a second side, a first lateral edge,
      and a second lateral edge (Figure 4)\\nwherein the first leg encapsulating member
      is disposed proximate the first side of the leg manifold member, the second
      leg encapsulating member is disposed proximate the second side of the leg manifold
      member, and the first leg encapsulating member and the second leg encapsulating
      member are coupled proximate the first lateral edge and the second lateral edge
      of the leg manifold member to form the first encapsulated leg member (Figure
      4)\\nIt would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art
      at the time the invention was made to modify each encapsulated leg member, of
      the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle, and Lockwood et al, to
      comprise a fenestrated first leg encapsulating member and a fenestrated second
      leg encapsulating member, as taught by Lockwood et al, as such will promote
      the healing of a large wound by providing vacuum therapy to the wound to promote

      is a quotation of pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) which forms the basis for all obviousness
      rejections set forth in this Office action:\\n(a) A patent may not be obtained
      though the invention is not identically disclosed or described as set forth
      in section 102, if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented
      and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been
      obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill
      in the art to which said subject matter pertains. Patentability shall not be
      negatived by the manner in which the invention was made.\\n\\nClaims 33, 40,
      and 42 are rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over
      Del Bigio et al (US 2009/0048582), and further in view of Odland (US 6,537,241)
      and Fowle (US 5,324,286).\\nIn regards to claim 33, Del Bigio et al teaches
      a system (Figure 7) for removing a fluid from a tissue site, comprising:\\nan
      inbound conduit (inflow tubing [7]) for placement proximate to the tissue site
      \\na treatment-fluid delivery unit (reservoir of dialysis fluid) adapted to
      be fluidly coupled to the inbound conduit for delivering a treatment fluid (dialysis
      fluid) to the inbound conduit (paragraph [0041])\\nan outbound conduit (outflow
      tubing [7]) for placement proximate to the tissue site, the outbound conduit
      fluidly coupled to the inbound conduit \\na treatment-fluid collector (waste
      reservoir) adapted to be fluidly coupled to the outbound conduit for receiving
      the treatment fluid and a recruited fluid from the tissue site (paragraph [0041])\\nwherein
      the treatment fluid is hyperosmotic (hyperosmolar) with respect to the tissue
      site (Abstract)\\n Del Bigio et al is silent about whether the inbound conduit
      and the outbound conduit are semi-permeable, as Del Bigio et al only states
      an osmotic cell with semipermeable membrane [6] between the inbound conduit
      and the outbound conduit (Figure 7). Odland teaches a system (Figures 26-27)
      comprising a semi-permeable inbound conduit (second lumen [230]) and a semi-permeable
      outbound conduit (semipermeable membranes [232]). It would have been obvious
      to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made
      to modify the inbound conduit and the outbound conduit, of the system of Del
      Bigio et al, to be semi-permeable, as taught by Odland, as such will provide
      further areas in addition to the osmotic cell for site specific microdialysis
      for recovering fluid from the tissue site and will provide an optimal combination
      of properties such as mass transfer properties and biocompatibility (Abstract)(column
      33, lines 16-18). Further, Del Bigio et al does not appear to teach that the
      treatment fluid comprises a dry gas. Fowle teaches a system (Figures 1-3) wherein
      a treatment fluid comprises a dry gas (dry inert gas stream [36]). It would
      have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the
      invention was made to modify the treatment fluid, of the modified system of
      Del Bigio et al and Odland, to comprise a dry gas, as taught by Fowle, as such
      will allow for transporting cryogenic droplets to the distal end of the conduit
      for cooling a cold-tip (Abstract), which can be manipulated to destroy a small
      amount of brain tissue (the thalamus) by freezing it (column 1, lines 13-19).\\n\\tIn
      regards to claim 40, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and
      Fowle, Del Bigio et al teaches a conduit interface (osmotic cell with semipermeable
      membrane [6]) for coupling the inbound conduit and the outbound conduit; however,
      Del Bigio et al does not teach that the conduit interface comprises a plurality
      of tributary conduits, as Del Bigio et al only  teaches a single conduit [6].
      But it would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art
      at the time the invention was made to modify the conduit interface, of the modified
      system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Fowle, to comprise a plurality of tributary
      conduits, as either configuration between the inbound conduit and the outbound
      conduit will allow for excess water and small molecules to be efficiently drawn
      from the surface of the brain, through osmotic forces, thereby reducing brain
      swelling.\\n\\tIn regards to claim 42, in the modified system of Del Bigio et
      al, Odland, and Fowle, Del Bigio et al teaches an open-cavity (Figure 7), reduced-pressure
      (Abstract) subsystem (mechanical pumping system) for removing fluids from a
      body cavity of a patient (paragraph [0041]).\\n\\nClaims 34-37 are rejected
      under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Del Bigio et al,
      Odland, and Fowle, as applied to claim 33 above, and further in view of Treu
      et al (US 6,254,567).\\nIn regards to claim 34, in the modified system of Del
      Bigio et al, Odland, and Fowle, Del Bigio et al is silent about a recruited-fluid
      determination unit coupled to the treatment-fluid collector for determining
      a volume of the recruited fluid. Treu et al teaches a system (Figure 7) wherein
      a recruited-fluid determination unit (fluid removal module [118]) is coupled
      to a treatment fluid collector (waste module [46]) for determining a volume
      of a recruited fluid. It would have been obvious to a person having ordinary
      skill in the art at the time the invention was made to modify the modified system,
      of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Fowle, with a recruited-fluid determination
      unit, as taught by Treu et al, as such will provide an efficient means for  monitoring
      the volume of excess fluid removed from the patient in order to aid in balancing
      the fluid level of the patient (column 10, lines 33-45)(column 3, lines 65-67).\\nIn
      regards to claim 35, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and
      Fowle, Del Bigio et al is silent about a volume transducer and a treatment controller
      comprising a microprocessor, a memory device, an input device, the volume transducer,
      and an output means. Treu et al teaches a system (Figures 1 and 7) comprising
      a volume transducer (means [124]) for developing a signal indicative of the
      volume of treatment fluid and recruited fluid (column 10, lines 41-45) and a
      treatment controller (processing controller [16]), the treatment controller
      comprising: a microprocessor (column 5, lines 21-22), a memory device associated
      with the microprocessor (column 5, line 38), an input device (interface [50])(input
      device [54]) associated with the microprocessor for receiving input signals,
      the volume transducer coupled to the input device (column 3, lines 65-67), and
      an output means associated with the microprocessor for delivering output signals
      (column 5, lines 21-44)(column 10, lines 33-45). It would have been obvious
      to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made
      to modify the modified system, of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Fowle, with a
      volume transducer and a treatment controller having a microprocessor, a memory
      device, an input device, the volume transducer, and an output means, as taught
      by Treu et al, as the volume transducer will provide an efficient means for
      monitoring the volume of excess fluid removed from the patient in order to aid
      in balancing the fluid level of the patient (column 10, lines 33-45)(column
      3, lines 65-67) and the treatment controller will govern the interactions within
      the system by providing the user with the current status of the system, prompting
      the user to input commands and information or receive data from the various
      sensors and other components, recording data in memory,  controlling the operation
      of the active components of the system, or alerting the patient to abnormal
      or failure conditions in the system (column 5, lines 21-44).\\nIn regards to
      claim 36, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle, and Treu
      et al, Del Bigio et al does not teach a microprocessor and a memory device.
      Treu et al teaches that the microprocessor and the memory device are operable
      to develop a control signal to adjust a flow rate in the treatment-fluid delivery
      unit (column 9, lines 57-62)(column 10, lines 1-7). It would have been obvious
      to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made
      to modify the modified system, of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle, and Treu et
      al, to adjust a flow rate in the treatment-fluid delivery unit, as taught by
      Treu et al, as adjusting the flow rate will help at least partially maintain
      a normal physiologic fluid and electrolytic balance in the patient (column 9,
      lines 52-54).\\nIn regards to claim 37, in the modified system of Del Bigio
      et al, Odland, Fowle, and Treu et al, Del Bigio et al does not teach that the
      treatment-fluid delivery unit comprises a heating element and the system comprises
      an inbound conduit temperature transducer coupled to the treatment controller.
      Treu et al teaches that the treatment-fluid delivery unit comprises a heating
      element (column 9, lines 4-10). It would have been obvious to a person having
      ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to modify the modified
      system, of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle, and Treu et al, with a heating element,
      as taught by Treu et al, as such will heat the treatment fluid to body temperature
      (column 9, lines 4-10), which will be more comfortable to the patient. However,
      Treu et al is silent about an inbound conduit temperature transducer. But it
      would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the
      time the invention was made to modify the modified system, of Del Bigio et al,
      Odland, Fowle, and  Treu et al, with an inbound conduit temperature transducer,
      as common practice in the art, as such will allow the treatment controller to
      sense and determine whether or not the treatment fluid is at an acceptable temperature,
      such as body temperature, for delivery to the patient. If the treatment fluid
      is not at an acceptable temperature, the treatment controller will direct the
      heating element to operate and regulate the temperature of the treatment fluid.\\n\\nClaims
      43-46 are rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over
      Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Fowle, as applied to claim 42 above, and further
      in view of Lockwood et al (US 6,752,794).\\nIn regards to claim 43, in the modified
      system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Fowle, Del Bigio et al is silent about
      whether the open-cavity, reduced-pressure subsystem comprises a treatment device,
      a manifold, a sealing member, a reduced-pressure delivery conduit, and a reduced-pressure
      interface. Lockwood et al teaches a system wherein an open-cavity, reduced-pressure
      subsystem (Figures 1-7) comprises: \\na treatment device comprising:\\na fenestrated
      non-adherent drape (member [20])\\na plurality of encapsulated leg members (channels
      [28]) coupled to the non-adherent drape, each having an interior portion with
      a leg manifold member [28] and formed with fenestrations (holes [36]) operable
      to allow fluid flow into the interior portion \\na central connection member
      (channels [30]) fluidly coupled to the plurality of encapsulated leg members,
      the central connection member having a first side (Figure 4) and a second, patient-facing
      side\\na manifold (vacuum/irrigation tube [13]) for disposing proximate the
      first side of the central connection member and operable to manifold reduced
      pressure to the central connection member \\na sealing member (sealing film
      [62]) for disposing on a portion of the patient\u2019s epidermis and operable
      to form a pneumatic seal over the body cavity\\na reduced-pressure delivery
      conduit (between vacuum source [12] and valve [66])\\na reduced-pressure interface
      (valve [66]) for coupling to the sealing member and operable to fluidly couple
      the reduced-pressure delivery conduit to the manifold\\nIt would have been obvious
      to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made
      to modify the open-cavity, reduced-pressure subsystem, of the modified system
      of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Fowle, to comprise a treatment device, a manifold,
      a sealing member, a reduced-pressure delivery conduit, and a reduced-pressure
      interface, as taught by Lockwood et al, as such will promote the healing of
      a large wound by providing vacuum therapy to the wound to promote blood flow
      and remove exudate from a wound surface of the wound (column 7, lines 54-57).\\n\\tIn
      regards to claim 44, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle,
      and Lockwood et al, Del Bigio et al is silent about a central connection member.
      Lockwood et al teaches that the central connection member has a connection manifold
      member [30] and wherein each leg manifold member is in fluid communication with
      the connection manifold member number='10'(Figure 4). It would have been obvious
      to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made
      to modify the central connection member, of the modified system of Del Bigio
      et al, Odland, Fowle, and Lockwood et al, to have a connection manifold member,
      as taught by Lockwood et al, as such will promote the healing of a large wound
      by providing vacuum therapy to the wound to promote blood flow and remove exudate
      from a wound surface of the wound (column 7, lines 54-57).\\nIn regards to claim
      45, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle, and Lockwood et
      al, Del Bigio et al is silent about the plurality of encapsulated leg members.
      Lockwood et al teaches that the outbound conduit [13] and the inbound conduit
      [13] are coupled to at least one of the plurality of encapsulated leg members
      (Figure 5). It would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in
      the art at the time the invention was made to modify the outbound conduit and
      the inbound conduit, of the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle,
      and Lockwood et al, to be coupled to at least one of the plurality of encapsulated
      leg members, as taught by Lockwood et al, as such will promote the healing of
      a large wound by providing vacuum therapy to the wound to promote blood flow
      and remove exudate from a wound surface of the wound (column 7, lines 54-57).\\nIn
      regards to claim 46, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle,
      and Lockwood et al, Del Bigio et al is silent about the plurality of encapsulated
      leg members. Lockwood et al teaches that each encapsulated leg member of the
      plurality of encapsulated leg members comprises:\\na fenestrated first leg encapsulating
      member [28]\\na fenestrated second leg encapsulating member [28]number='11'\\nwherein
      the leg manifold member has a first side, a second side, a first lateral edge,
      and a second lateral edge (Figure 4)\\nwherein the first leg encapsulating member
      is disposed proximate the first side of the leg manifold member, the second
      leg encapsulating member is disposed proximate the second side of the leg manifold
      member, and the first leg encapsulating member and the second leg encapsulating
      member are coupled proximate the first lateral edge and the second lateral edge
      of the leg manifold member to form the first encapsulated leg member (Figure
      4)\\nIt would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art
      at the time the invention was made to modify each encapsulated leg member, of
      the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle, and Lockwood et al, to
      comprise a fenestrated first leg encapsulating member and a fenestrated second
      leg encapsulating member, as taught by Lockwood et al, as such will promote
      the healing of a large wound by providing vacuum therapy to the wound to promote
      blood flow and remove exudate from a wound surface of the wound (column 7, lines
      54-57).\\n\\nResponse to Arguments\\nApplicant's arguments filed August 5, 2016,
      have been fully considered but they are not persuasive:\\nIn regards to claim
      33, Applicant argued: Thus, in contrast to the treatment fluid applications
      of Del Bigio and Odland, which may rely on specific osmotic properties and gradients
      for fluid exchange with a tissue site, Fowle is drawn to the unrelated application
      of cooling a tip of a probe. A person skilled in the art would not look to a
      reference teaching the use number='12'of a probe with a cooled-tip for performing
      surgical procedures in order to provide an applicable solution used for establishing
      osmotic dialysis gradients across semipermeable membranes (Remarks, page 16).
      Examiner disagrees. Both Del Bigio et al and Fowle teach systems used on the
      brain, thus being analogous art and reasonably combinable at the time the invention
      was made. Thus, the dry gas, of Fowle, which allows for transporting cryogenic
      droplets to the distal end of the conduit for cooling a cold-tip (Abstract),
      which can be manipulated to destroy a small amount of brain tissue (the thalamus)
      by freezing it (column 1, lines 13-19), is relevant to the system, of Del Bigio
      et al, also used on the brain.\\n\\nAllowable Subject Matter\\nClaims 1-6 and
      8-19 are allowed.\\nIn regards to independent claim 1, the prior art of record
      does not disclose or render obvious at the time the invention was made the combination
      of a fluid removal system for removing a fluid from a tissue site, as claimed,
      specifically including the conduit interface comprising a plurality of tributary
      conduits configured/sized for a patient\u2019s abdominal cavity.\\nDel Bigio
      et al teaches a fluid removal system (Figure 7) for removing a fluid from a
      tissue site, comprising a conduit interface (osmotic cell with semipermeable
      membrane [6]); however, Del Bigio et al does not teach that the conduit interface
      comprises a plurality of tributary conduits, as Del Bigio et al only teaches
      a single conduit [6]. But it would have been obvious to a person having ordinary
      skill in the art at the time the invention was made to modify the conduit interface,
      of the system of Del Bigio et al, to comprise a plurality of tributary conduits,
      as either configuration between the inbound conduit (inflow tubing [7]) and
      the number='13'outbound conduit (outflow tubing [7]) will allow for excess water
      and small molecules to be efficiently drawn from the surface of the brain, through
      osmotic forces, thereby reducing brain swelling. Further, as Del Bigio et al
      teaches that the system is used on the brain (Abstract), Del Bigio et al does
      not teach a plurality of tributary conduits configured/sized for a patient\u2019s
      abdominal cavity. Odland (US 6,537,241) teaches a system (Figures 26-27) used
      in an intraperitoneal route (column 32, lines 31-34), which is associated with
      a patient\u2019s abdominal cavity; however, Odland does not teach a plurality
      of tributary conduits.\\nThus, independent claim 1 is allowable. Dependent claims
      2-6 and 8-19 are allowable by virtue of being dependent upon independent claim
      1.\\n\\nClaim 41 is objected to as being dependent upon a rejected base claim,
      but would be allowable if rewritten in independent form including all of the
      limitations of the base claim and any intervening claims.\\nIn regards to dependent
      claim 41, the prior art of record does not disclose or render obvious at the
      time the invention was made the combination of a system for removing a fluid
      from a tissue site, as claimed, specifically including that the plurality of
      tributary conduits is sized for a patient\u2019s abdominal cavity.\\nDel Bigio
      et al teaches a system (Figure 7) for removing a fluid from a tissue site; however,
      Del Bigio et al does not teach a plurality of tributary conduits sized for a
      patient\u2019s abdominal cavity, as Del Bigio et al teaches that the system
      is used on the brain (Abstract). Odland teaches a system (Figures 26-27) used
      in an intraperitoneal route (column 32, lines 31-number='14'34), which is associated
      with a patient\u2019s abdominal cavity; however, Odland does not teach a plurality
      of tributary conduits.\\n\\nConclusion\\nTHIS ACTION IS MADE FINAL.  Applicant
      is reminded of the extension of time policy as set forth in 37 CFR 1.136(a).

      present application is being examined under the pre-AIA  first to invent provisions.
      \\n\\nContinued Examination Under 37 CFR 1.114\\nA request for continued examination
      under 37 CFR 1.114, including the fee set forth in 37 CFR 1.17(e), was filed
      in this application after final rejection.  Since this application is eligible
      for continued examination under 37 CFR 1.114, and the fee set forth in 37 CFR
      1.17(e) has been timely paid, the finality of the previous Office action has
      been withdrawn pursuant to 37 CFR 1.114.  Applicant's submission filed on April
      18, 2017, has been entered.\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\nIn the reply, filed on April
      18, 2017, Applicant requested the entry of the after final amendment of February
      23, 2017. The amendment is now entered.\\nApplicant amended claims 1, 9, 10,
      33, 38, and 39.\\nApplicant cancelled claims 40 and 41.\\nIn the final rejection
      of November 18, 2016, Examiner objected to the Abstract. Applicant amended the
      Abstract. Objection is withdrawn.\\nExaminer objected to claims 1, 9, and 10.
      Applicant amended claims 1, 9, and 10. Objection is withdrawn.\\n\\n Examiner\u2019s
      Amendment\\nAn examiner\u2019s amendment to the record appears below. Should
      the changes and/or additions be unacceptable to applicant, an amendment may
      be filed as provided by 37 CFR 1.312. To ensure consideration of such an amendment,
      it MUST be submitted no later than the payment of the issue fee.\\nAuthorization
      for this examiner\u2019s amendment was given in an interview with Thomas Schiano
      on August 3, 2017.\\nThe application has been amended as follows: \\nClaim 11
      (Currently Amended) The system for removing the fluid from the tissue site of
      claim 1 further comprising an open-cavity, reduced-pressure subsystem for removing
      fluids from a body cavity of the patient.\\nClaim 20 (Cancelled)\\nClaim 21
      (Cancelled)\\nClaim 42 (Currently Amended) The system of claim 33, further comprising
      an open-cavity, reduced-pressure subsystem for removing fluids from a body cavity
      of the patient.\\n\\nReasons for Allowance\\nThe following is an examiner\u2019s
      statement of reasons for allowance: \\nIn regards to independent claim 1, the
      prior art of record does not disclose or render obvious at the time the invention
      was made the combination of a fluid removal system for removing a fluid from
      a tissue site, as claimed, specifically including the conduit interface comprising
      a plurality of tributary conduits sized for a patient\u2019s abdominal cavity.\\n
      In regards to independent claim 33, the prior art of record does not disclose
      or render obvious at the time the invention was made the combination of a system
      for removing a fluid from a tissue site, as claimed, specifically including
      the conduit interface comprising a plurality of tributary conduits sized for
      a patient\u2019s abdominal cavity.\\nDel Bigio et al (US 2009/0048582) teaches
      a fluid removal system (Figure 7) for removing a fluid from a tissue site, comprising
      a conduit interface (osmotic cell with semipermeable membrane [6]) for coupling
      the inbound conduit (inflow tubing [7]) and the outbound conduit (outflow tubing
      [7]); however, Del Bigio et al does not teach that the conduit interface comprises
      a plurality of tributary conduits, as Del Bigio et al only teaches a single
      conduit [6]. But it would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill
      in the art at the time the invention was made to modify the conduit interface,
      of the system of Del Bigio et al, to comprise a plurality of tributary conduits,
      as either configuration between the inbound conduit and the outbound conduit
      will allow for excess water and small molecules to be efficiently drawn from
      the surface of the brain, through osmotic forces, thereby reducing brain swelling.
      Further, as Del Bigio et al teaches that the system is used on the brain (Abstract),
      Del Bigio et al does not teach a plurality of tributary conduits sized for a
      patient\u2019s abdominal cavity. Odland (US 6,537,241) teaches a system (Figures
      26-27) used in an intraperitoneal route (column 32, lines 31-34), which is associated
      with a patient\u2019s abdominal cavity; however, Odland does not teach a plurality
      of tributary conduits sized for the patient\u2019s abdominal cavity. Thus, independent
      claims 1 and 33 are allowable. Dependent claims 2-6, 8-19, 34-39, and 42-46
      are allowable by virtue of being dependent upon one of independent claims 1
      and 33.\\n\\n Any comments considered necessary by applicant must be submitted
      no later than the payment of the issue fee and, to avoid processing delays,
      should preferably accompany the issue fee.  Such submissions should be clearly
      labeled \u201CComments on Statement of Reasons for Allowance.\u201D\\n\\nConclusion\\nAny
      inquiry concerning this communication or earlier communications from the examiner
      should be directed to SHEFALI PATEL whose telephone number is (571)270-3645.

      \       \"bodyText\":[\"DETAILED ACTION\\n\\nNotice of Pre-AIA  or AIA  Status\\nThe
      present application is being examined under the pre-AIA  first to invent provisions.
      \\n\\nElection/Restrictions\\nRestriction to one of the following inventions
      is required under 35 U.S.C. 121:\\nI. Claims 1-19 and 33-46, drawn to a fluid
      removal system for removing fluid from a tissue site, classified in A61M 1/008.\\nII.
      Claims 20 and 21, drawn to a method of manufacturing a fluid removal system,
      classified in Y10T 29/49826.\\nInventions II and I are related as process of
      making and product made.  The inventions are distinct if either or both of the
      following can be shown: (1) that the process as claimed can be used to make
      another and materially different product or (2) that the product as claimed
      can be made by another and materially different process (MPEP \xA7 806.05(f)).
      \ In the instant case, the product as claimed can be made by another and materially
      different process, such as coupling the inbound conduit and the outbound conduit
      by a conduit interface having a plurality of tributary conduits.\\nRestriction
      for examination purposes as indicated is proper because all these inventions
      listed in this action are independent or distinct for the reasons given above
      and there would be a serious search and/or examination burden if restriction
      were not required because one or more of the following reasons apply: \\nthe
      inventions have acquired a separate status in the art in view of their different
      classification\\nthe inventions have acquired a separate status in the art due
      to their recognized divergent subject matter\\nthe inventions require a different
      field of search (e.g., searching different classes/subclasses or electronic
      resources, or employing different search strategies or search queries).\\nApplicant
      is advised that the reply to this requirement to be complete must include (i)
      an election of a invention to be examined even though the requirement may be
      traversed (37 CFR 1.143) and (ii) identification of the claims encompassing
      the elected invention. \\nThe election of an invention may be made with or without
      traverse. To reserve a right to petition, the election must be made with traverse.
      If the reply does not distinctly and specifically point out supposed errors
      in the restriction requirement, the election shall be treated as an election
      without traverse. Traversal must be presented at the time of election in order
      to be considered timely. Failure to timely traverse the requirement will result
      in the loss of right to petition under 37 CFR 1.144. If claims are added after
      the election, applicant must indicate which of these claims are readable upon
      the elected invention.\\nShould applicant traverse on the ground that the inventions
      are not patentably distinct, applicant should submit evidence or identify such
      evidence now of record showing the inventions to be obvious variants or clearly
      admit on the record that this is the case. In either instance, if the examiner
      finds one of the inventions unpatentable over the prior art, the evidence  or
      admission may be used in a rejection under 35 U.S.C. 103 or pre-AIA  35 U.S.C.
      103(a) of the other invention.\\n\\nThis application contains claims directed
      to the following patentably distinct species:\\nI. Embodiment I:\\tFigures 2A-2D\\nII.
      Embodiment II:\\tFigures 3-7\\nThe species are independent or distinct because
      the claims to the different species recite the mutually exclusive characteristics
      of such species. For example, Embodiment I at least claims a sealing member
      operable to form a pneumatic seal over the body cavity. Embodiment II at least
      claims that the inbound conduit and the outbound conduit both comprise a first
      portion and a second portion, the first portion and the second portion coupled
      by a coupler. In addition, these species are not obvious variants of each other
      based on the current record.\\nApplicant is required under 35 U.S.C. 121 to
      elect a single disclosed species, or a single grouping of patentably indistinct
      species, for prosecution on the merits to which the claims shall be restricted
      if no generic claim is finally held to be allowable. Currently, claims 1, 20,
      and 33 are generic.\\nThere is a search and/or examination burden for the patentably
      distinct species as set forth above because at least the following reason(s)
      apply:\\nthe species or groupings of patentably indistinct species have acquired
      a separate status in the art due to their recognized divergent subject matter
      \\nthe species or groupings of patentably indistinct species require a different
      field of search (e.g., searching different classes/subclasses or electronic
      resources, or employing different search strategies or search queries).\\nApplicant
      is advised that the reply to this requirement to be complete must include (i)
      an election of a species to be examined even though the requirement may be traversed
      (37 CFR 1.143) and (ii) identification of the claims encompassing the elected
      species or grouping of patentably indistinct species, including any claims subsequently
      added. An argument that a claim is allowable or that all claims are generic
      is considered nonresponsive unless accompanied by an election.\\nThe election
      may be made with or without traverse. To preserve a right to petition, the election
      must be made with traverse. If the reply does not distinctly and specifically
      point out supposed errors in the election of species requirement, the election
      shall be treated as an election without traverse. Traversal must be presented
      at the time of election in order to be considered timely. Failure to timely
      traverse the requirement will result in the loss of right to petition under
      37 CFR 1.144. If claims are added after the election, applicant must indicate
      which of these claims are readable on the elected species or grouping of patentably
      indistinct species.\\nShould applicant traverse on the ground that the species,
      or groupings of patentably indistinct species from which election is required,
      are not patentably distinct, applicant should submit evidence or identify such
      evidence now of record showing them to be obvious variants or clearly admit
      on the record that this is the case. In either instance, if the examiner finds
      one of the species unpatentable over the prior art, the evidence or admission
      may be used in a rejection under 35 U.S.C. 103 or pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a)
      of the other species.\\n Upon the allowance of a generic claim, applicant will
      be entitled to consideration of claims to additional species which depend from
      or otherwise require all the limitations of an allowable generic claim as provided
      by 37 CFR 1.141.\\n\\nApplicant is reminded that upon the cancellation of claims
      to a non-elected invention, the inventorship must be corrected in compliance
      with  37 CFR 1.48(a) if one or more of the currently named inventors is no longer
      an inventor of at least one claim remaining in the application. A request to
      correct inventorship under 37 CFR 1.48(a) must be accompanied by an application
      data sheet in accordance with 37 CFR 1.76 that identifies each inventor by his
      or her legal name and by the processing fee required under 37 CFR 1.17(i).\\n\\nThe
      examiner has required restriction between product or apparatus claims and process
      claims. Where applicant elects claims directed to the product/apparatus, and
      all product/apparatus claims are subsequently found allowable, withdrawn process
      claims that include all the limitations of the allowable product/apparatus claims
      should be considered for rejoinder. All claims directed to a nonelected process
      invention must include all the limitations of an allowable product/apparatus
      claim for that process invention to be rejoined. \\nIn the event of rejoinder,
      the requirement for restriction between the product/apparatus claims and the
      rejoined process claims will be withdrawn, and the rejoined process claims will
      be fully examined for patentability in accordance with 37 CFR 1.104. Thus, to
      be allowable, the rejoined claims must meet all criteria for patentability including
      the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 101, 102, 103 and 112. Until all claims to the
      elected product/apparatus are found allowable, an  otherwise proper restriction
      requirement between product/apparatus claims and process claims may be maintained.
      Withdrawn process claims that are not commensurate in scope with an allowable
      product/apparatus claim will not be rejoined. See MPEP \xA7 821.04. Additionally,
      in order for rejoinder to occur, applicant is advised that the process claims
      should be amended during prosecution to require the limitations of the product/apparatus
      claims. Failure to do so may result in no rejoinder. Further, note that the
      prohibition against double patenting rejections of 35 U.S.C. 121 does not apply
      where the restriction requirement is withdrawn by the examiner before the patent
      issues. See MPEP \xA7 804.01.\\n\\nAny inquiry concerning this communication

      under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Del Bigio et al (US
      2009/0048582), and further in view of Odland (US 6,537,241).\\nIn regards to
      claim 1, Del Bigio et al teaches a fluid removal system (Figure 7) for removing
      fluid from a tissue site, comprising:\\nan inbound conduit (inflow tubing [7])
      for placement proximate to the tissue site \\na treatment-fluid delivery unit
      (reservoir of dialysis fluid) adapted to be fluidly coupled to the inbound conduit
      for delivering a treatment fluid (dialysis fluid) to the inbound conduit (paragraph
      [0041])\\nan outbound conduit (outflow tubing [7]) for placement proximate to
      the tissue site, the outbound conduit fluidly coupled to the inbound conduit
      \\na treatment-fluid collector (waste reservoir) adapted to be fluidly coupled
      to the outbound conduit for receiving the treatment fluid and a recruited fluid
      from the tissue site (paragraph [0041])\\na conduit interface (osmotic cell
      with semipermeable membrane [6]) for coupling the inbound conduit and the outbound
      conduit\\nDel Bigio et al is silent about whether the inbound conduit and the
      outbound conduit are semi-permeable, as Del Bigio et al only states an osmotic
      cell with semipermeable membrane [6] between the inbound conduit and the outbound
      conduit (Figure 7). Odland teaches a system (Figures 26-27) comprising a semi-permeable
      inbound conduit (second lumen [230]) and a semi-permeable outbound conduit (semipermeable
      membranes [232]). It would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill
      in the art at the time the invention was made to modify the inbound conduit
      and the outbound conduit, of the system of Del Bigio et al, to be semi-permeable,
      as  taught by Odland, as such will provide further areas in addition to the
      osmotic cell for site specific microdialysis for recovering fluid from the tissue
      site and will provide an optimal combination of properties such as mass transfer
      properties and biocompatibility (Abstract)(column 33, lines 16-18). Further,
      Del Bigio et al does not teach that the conduit interface comprises a plurality
      of tributary conduits, as Del Bigio et al only teaches a single conduit [6].
      But it would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art
      at the time the invention was made to modify the conduit interface, of the modified
      system of Del Bigio et al and Odland, to comprise a plurality of tributary conduits,
      as either configuration between the inbound conduit and the outbound conduit
      will allow for excess water and small molecules to be efficiently drawn from
      the surface of the brain, through osmotic forces, thereby reducing brain swelling.\\n\\tIn
      regards to claim 3, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al and Odland, Del
      Bigio et al teaches that the treatment fluid is disposed within the inbound
      conduit and outbound conduit, wherein the treatment fluid is a Dextran solution
      (Abstract).\\n\\tIn regards to claim 8, in the modified system of Del Bigio
      et al and Odland, Del Bigio et al does not teach tributary conduits. But it
      would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the
      time the invention was made to modify the tributary conduits, of the modified
      system of Del Bigio et al and Odland, to be sized and provided in a quantity
      to provide a desired surface area, as such will allow for excess water and small
      molecules to be efficiently drawn from the surface of the brain, through osmotic
      forces, thereby reducing brain swelling.\\n \\tIn regards to claim 11, in the
      modified system of Del Bigio et al and Odland, Del Bigio et al teaches an open-cavity
      (Figure 7), reduced-pressure (Abstract) subsystem (mechanical pumping system)
      for removing fluids from a body cavity of a patient (paragraph [0041]).\\n Claims
      2 and 4-6 are rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable
      over Del Bigio et al and Odland, as applied to claim 1 above, and further in
      view of Treu et al (US 6,254,567).\\nIn regards to claim 2, in the modified
      system of Del Bigio et al and Odland, Del Bigio et al is silent about a recruited-fluid
      determination unit coupled to the treatment-fluid collector for determining
      a volume of the recruited fluid. Treu et al teaches a system (Figure 7) wherein
      a recruited-fluid determination unit (fluid removal module [118]) is coupled
      to a treatment fluid collector (waste module [46]) for determining a volume
      of a recruited fluid. It would have been obvious to a person having ordinary
      skill in the art at the time the invention was made to modify the modified system,
      of Del Bigio et al and Odland, with a recruited-fluid determination unit, as
      taught by Treu et al, as such will provide an efficient means for monitoring
      the volume of excess fluid removed from the patient in order to aid in balancing
      the fluid level of the patient (column 10, lines 33-45)(column 3, lines 65-67).\\nIn
      regards to claim 4, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al and Odland, Del
      Bigio et al is silent about a volume transducer and a treatment controller comprising
      a microprocessor, a memory device, an input device, the volume transducer, and
      an output means. Treu et al teaches a system (Figures 1 and 7) comprising a
      volume transducer (means [124]) for developing a signal indicative of the volume
      of treatment fluid and recruited fluid (column 10, lines 41-45)  and a treatment
      controller (processing controller [16]), the treatment controller comprising:
      a microprocessor (column 5, lines 21-22), a memory device associated with the
      microprocessor (column 5, line 38), a input device (interface [50])(input device
      [54]) associated with the microprocessor for receiving input signals, the volume
      transducer coupled to the input device (column 3, lines 65-67), and an output
      means associated with the microprocessor for delivering output signals (column
      5, lines 21-44)(column 10, lines 33-45). It would have been obvious to a person
      having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to modify
      the modified system, of Del Bigio et al and Odland, with a volume transducer
      and a treatment controller having a microprocessor, a memory device, an input
      device, the volume transducer, and an output means, as taught by Treu et al,
      as the volume transducer will provide an efficient means for monitoring the
      volume of excess fluid removed from the patient in order to aid in balancing
      the fluid level of the patient (column 10, lines 33-45)(column 3, lines 65-67)
      and the treatment controller will govern the interactions within the system
      by providing the user with the current status of the system, prompting the user
      to input commands and information or receive data from the various sensors and
      other components, recording data in memory, controlling the operation of the
      active components of the system, or alerting the patient to abnormal or failure
      conditions in the system (column 5, lines 21-44).\\nIn regards to claim 5, in
      the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Treu et al, Del Bigio et
      al does not teach a microprocessor and memory device. Treu et al teaches that
      the microprocessor and memory device are operable to develop a control signal
      to adjust a flow rate in the treatment-fluid delivery unit (column 9, lines
      57-62)(column 10, lines 1-7). It would have been obvious to a person having
      ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to number='10'modify
      the modified system, of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Treu et al, to adjust a
      flow rate in the treatment-fluid delivery unit, as taught by Treu et al, as
      adjusting the flow rate will help at least partially maintain a normal physiologic
      fluid and electrolytic balance in the patient (column 9, lines 52-54).\\nIn
      regards to claim 6, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Treu
      et al, Del Bigio et al does not teach that the treatment-fluid delivery unit
      comprises a heating element and the system comprises an inbound conduit temperature
      transducer coupled to the treatment controller. Treu et al teaches that the
      treatment-fluid delivery unit comprises a heating element (column 9, lines 4-10).
      It would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the
      time the invention was made to modify the modified system, of Del Bigio et al,
      Odland, and Treu et al, with a heating element, as taught by Treu et al, as
      such will heat the treatment fluid to body temperature (column 9, lines 4-10),
      which will be more comfortable to the patient. However, Treu et al is silent
      about an inbound conduit temperature transducer. But it would have been obvious
      to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made
      to modify the modified system, of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Treu et al, with
      an inbound conduit temperature transducer, as common practice in the art, as
      such will allow the treatment controller to sense and determine whether or not
      the treatment fluid is at an acceptable temperature, such as body temperature,
      for delivery to the patient. If the treatment fluid is not at an acceptable
      temperature, the treatment controller will direct the heating element to operate
      and regulate the temperature of the treatment fluid.\\n Claims 12-15 and 19
      are rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Del
      Bigio et al and Odland, as applied to claim 11 above, and further in view of
      Lockwood et al (US 6,752,794).\\nIn regards to claim 12, in the modified system
      of Del Bigio et al and Odland, Del Bigio et al is silent about whether the open-cavity,
      reduced-pressure subsystem comprises a treatment device, a manifold, a sealing
      member, a reduced-pressure delivery conduit, and a reduced-pressure interface.
      Lockwood et al teaches a system wherein an open-cavity, reduced-pressure subsystem
      (Figures 1-7) comprises: \\na treatment device comprising:\\na fenestrated non-adherent
      drape (member [20])\\na plurality of encapsulated leg members (channels [28])
      coupled to the non-adherent drape, each having an interior portion with a leg
      manifold member [28] and formed with fenestrations (holes [36]) operable to
      allow fluid flow into the interior portion\\na central connection member (channels
      [30]) fluidly coupled to the plurality of encapsulated legs, the central connection
      member having a first side (Figure 4) and a second, patient-facing side\\na
      manifold (vacuum/irrigation tube [13]) for disposing proximate the first side
      of the central connection member and operable to manifold reduced pressure to
      the central connection member \\na sealing member (sealing film [62]) for disposing
      on a portion of the patient\u2019s epidermis and operable to form a pneumatic
      seal over the body cavitynumber='11'\\na reduced-pressure delivery conduit (between
      vacuum source [12] and valve [66])\\na reduced-pressure interface (valve [66])
      for coupling to the sealing member and operable to fluidly couple the reduced-pressure
      delivery conduit to the manifold\\nIt would have been obvious to a person having
      ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to modify the open-cavity,
      reduced-pressure subsystem, of the modified system of Del Bigio et al and Odland,
      to comprise a treatment device, a manifold, a sealing member, a reduced-pressure
      delivery conduit, and a reduced-pressure interface, as taught by Lockwood et
      al, as such will promote the healing of a large wound by providing vacuum therapy
      to the wound to promote blood flow and remove exudate from a wound surface of
      the wound (column 7, lines 54-57).\\n\\tIn regards to claim 13, in the modified
      system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Lockwood et al, Del Bigio et al is silent
      about a central connection member. Lockwood et al teaches that the central connection
      member has a connection manifold member [30] and wherein each leg manifold member
      is in fluid communication with the connection manifold member (Figure 4). It
      would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the
      time the invention was made to modify the central connection member, of the
      modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Lockwood et al, to have a connection
      manifold member, as taught by Lockwood et al, as such will promote the healing
      of a large wound by providing vacuum therapy to the wound to promote blood flow
      and remove exudate from a wound surface of the wound (column 7, lines 54-57).\\nIn
      regards to claim 14, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and
      Lockwood et al, Del Bigio et al is silent about the plurality of encapsulated
      leg members. Lockwood et al teaches that the outbound conduit [13] and inbound
      conduit [13] are coupled to at least one of the number='12'plurality of encapsulated
      leg members (Figure 5). It would have been obvious to a person having ordinary
      skill in the art at the time the invention was made to modify the outbound conduit
      and inbound conduit, of the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and
      Lockwood et al, to be coupled to at least one of the plurality of encapsulated
      leg members, as taught by Lockwood et al, as such will promote the healing of
      a large wound by providing vacuum therapy to the wound to promote blood flow
      and remove exudate from a wound surface of the wound (column 7, lines 54-57).\\nIn
      regards to claim 15, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and
      Lockwood et al, Del Bigio et al teaches a treatment fluid disposed within the
      inbound conduit and outbound conduit, wherein the treatment fluid is a Dextran
      solution (Abstract).\\nIn regards to claim 19, in the modified system of Del
      Bigio et al, Odland, and Lockwood et al, Del Bigio et al is silent about the
      plurality of encapsulated leg members. Lockwood et al teaches that each encapsulated
      leg member of the plurality of encapsulated leg members comprises:\\na fenestrated
      first leg encapsulating member [28]\\na fenestrated second leg encapsulating
      member [28]\\nwherein the leg manifold member has a first side, a second side,
      a first lateral edge, and a second lateral edge (Figure 4)\\nwherein the first
      leg encapsulating member is disposed proximate the first side of the leg manifold
      member, the second leg encapsulating member is disposed proximate the second
      patient-facing side of the leg manifold member, and the first leg encapsulating
      member and second leg encapsulating member are coupled proximate number='13'the
      first lateral edge and second lateral edge of the leg manifold member to form
      the first encapsulated leg member (Figure 4)\\nIt would have been obvious to
      a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made
      to modify each encapsulated leg member, of the modified system of Del Bigio
      et al, Odland, and Lockwood et al, to comprise a fenestrated first leg encapsulating
      member and a fenestrated second leg encapsulating member, as taught by Lockwood
      et al, as such will promote the healing of a large wound by providing vacuum
      therapy to the wound to promote blood flow and remove exudate from a wound surface
      of the wound (column 7, lines 54-57).\\n Claims 16-18 are rejected under pre-AIA
      \ 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Lockwood
      et al, as applied to claim 12 above, and further in view of Treu et al.\\nIn
      regards to claim 16, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and
      Lockwood et al, Del Bigio et al is silent about a volume transducer and a treatment
      controller comprising a microprocessor, a memory device, an input device, the
      volume transducer, and an output device. Treu et al teaches a system (Figures
      1 and 7) comprising a volume transducer (means [124]) for developing a signal
      indicative of the volume of treatment fluid and recruited fluid (column 10,
      lines 41-45) and a treatment controller (processing controller [16]), the treatment
      controller comprising: a microprocessor (column 5, lines 21-22), a memory device
      associated with the microprocessor (column 5, line 38), a input device (interface
      [50])(input device [54]) associated with the microprocessor for receiving input
      signals, the volume transducer coupled to the input device (column 3, lines
      65-67), and an output device associated with the microprocessor for number='14'delivering
      output signals (column 5, lines 21-44)(column 10, lines 33-45). It would have
      been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention
      was made to modify the modified system, of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Lockwood
      et al, with a volume transducer and a treatment controller having a microprocessor,
      a memory device, an input device, the volume transducer, and an output device,
      as taught by Treu et al, as the volume transducer will provide an efficient
      means for monitoring the volume of excess fluid removed from the patient in
      order to aid in balancing the fluid level of the patient (column 10, lines 33-45)(column
      3, lines 65-67) and the treatment controller will govern the interactions within
      the system by providing the user with the current status of the system, prompting
      the user to input commands and information or receive data from the various
      sensors and other components, recording data in memory, controlling the operation
      of the active components of the system, or alerting the patient to abnormal
      or failure conditions in the system (column 5, lines 21-44).\\nIn regards to
      claim 17, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Lockwood et al,
      and Treu et al, Del Bigio et al does not teach a microprocessor and memory device.
      Treu et al teaches that the microprocessor and memory device are operable to
      develop a control signal to adjust a flow rate in the treatment-fluid delivery
      unit (column 9, lines 57-62)(column 10, lines 1-7). It would have been obvious
      to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made
      to modify the modified system, of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Lockwood et al, and
      Treu et al, to adjust a flow rate in the treatment-fluid delivery unit, as taught
      by Treu et al, as adjusting the flow rate will help at least partially maintain
      a normal physiologic fluid and electrolytic balance in the patient (column 9,
      lines 52-54).\\nnumber='15'In regards to claim 18, in the modified system of
      Del Bigio et al, Odland, Lockwood et al, and Treu et al, Del Bigio et al does
      not teach that the treatment-fluid delivery unit comprises a heating element
      and the system comprises an inbound conduit temperature transducer coupled to
      the treatment controller. Treu et al teaches that the treatment-fluid delivery
      unit comprises a heating element (column 9, lines 4-10). It would have been
      obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention
      was made to modify the modified system, of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Lockwood
      et al, and Treu et al, with a heating element, as taught by Treu et al, as such
      will heat the treatment fluid to body temperature (column 9, lines 4-10), which
      will be more comfortable to the patient. However, Treu et al is silent about
      an inbound conduit temperature transducer. But it would have been obvious to
      a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made
      to modify the modified system, of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Lockwood et al, and
      Treu et al, with an inbound conduit temperature transducer, as common practice
      in the art, as such will allow the treatment controller to sense and determine
      whether or not the treatment fluid is at an acceptable temperature, such as
      body temperature, for delivery to the patient. If the treatment fluid is not
      at an acceptable temperature, the treatment controller will direct the heating
      element to operate and regulate the temperature of the treatment fluid.\\n Claims
      33, 40, and 42 are rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable
      over Del Bigio et al, and further in view of Odland and Fowle.\\nIn regards
      to claim 33, Del Bigio et al teaches a system (Figure 7) for removing fluid
      from a tissue site, comprising:\\nan inbound conduit (inflow tubing [7]) for
      placement proximate to the tissue site number='16'\\na treatment-fluid delivery
      unit (reservoir of dialysis fluid) adapted to be fluidly coupled to the inbound

      (paragraph [0041])\\nan outbound conduit (outflow tubing [7]) for placement
      proximate to the tissue site, the outbound conduit fluidly coupled to the inbound
      conduit \\na treatment-fluid collector (waste reservoir) adapted to be fluidly
      coupled to the outbound conduit for receiving the treatment fluid and a recruited
      fluid from the tissue site (paragraph [0041])\\nwherein the treatment fluid
      is hyperosmotic (hyperosmolar) with respect to the tissue site (Abstract)\\nDel
      Bigio et al is silent about whether the inbound conduit and the outbound conduit
      are semi-permeable, as Del Bigio et al only states an osmotic cell with semipermeable
      membrane [6] between the inbound conduit and the outbound conduit (Figure 7).
      Odland teaches a system (Figures 26-27) comprising a semi-permeable inbound
      conduit (second lumen [230]) and a semi-permeable outbound conduit (semipermeable
      membranes [232]). It would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill
      in the art at the time the invention was made to modify the inbound conduit
      and the outbound conduit, of the system of Del Bigio et al, to be semi-permeable,
      as taught by Odland, as such will provide further areas in addition to the osmotic
      cell for site specific microdialysis for recovering fluid from the tissue site
      and will provide an optimal combination of properties such as mass transfer
      properties and biocompatibility (Abstract)(column 33, lines 16-18). Further,
      Del Bigio et al does not appear to teach that the treatment fluid comprises
      a dry gas. Fowle teaches a system (Figures 1-3) wherein a number='17'treatment
      fluid comprises a dry gas (dry inert gas stream [36]). It would have been obvious
      to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made
      to modify the treatment fluid, of the modified system of Del Bigio et al and
      Odland, to comprise a dry gas, as taught by Fowle, as such will allow for transporting
      cryogenic droplets to the distal end of the conduit for cooling a cold-tip (Abstract),
      which can be manipulated to destroy a small amount of brain tissue (the thalamus)
      by freezing it (column 1, lines 13-19).\\n\\tIn regards to claim 40, in the
      modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Fowle, Del Bigio et al teaches
      a conduit interface (osmotic cell with semipermeable membrane [6]) for coupling
      the inbound conduit and the outbound conduit; however, Del Bigio et al does
      not teach that the conduit interface comprises a plurality of tributary conduits,
      as Del Bigio et al only teaches a single conduit [6]. But it would have been
      obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention
      was made to modify the conduit interface, of the modified system of Del Bigio
      et al, Odland, and Fowle, to comprise a plurality of tributary conduits, as
      either configuration between the inbound conduit and the outbound conduit will
      allow for excess water and small molecules to be efficiently drawn from the
      surface of the brain, through osmotic forces, thereby reducing brain swelling.\\n\\tIn
      regards to claim 42, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and
      Fowle, Del Bigio et al teaches an open-cavity (Figure 7), reduced-pressure (Abstract)
      subsystem (mechanical pumping system) for removing fluids from a body cavity
      of a patient (paragraph [0041]).\\n Claims 34-37 are rejected under pre-AIA
      \ 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Fowle,
      as applied to claim 33 above, and further in view of Treu et al.\\nIn regards
      to claim 34, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Fowle, Del
      Bigio et al is silent about a recruited-fluid determination unit coupled to
      the treatment-fluid collector for determining a volume of the recruited fluid.
      Treu et al teaches a system (Figure 7) wherein a recruited-fluid determination
      unit (fluid removal module [118]) is coupled to a treatment fluid collector
      (waste module [46]) for determining a volume of a recruited fluid. It would
      have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the
      invention was made to modify the modified system, of Del Bigio et al, Odland,
      and Fowle, with a recruited-fluid determination unit, as taught by Treu et al,
      as such will provide an efficient means for monitoring the volume of excess
      fluid removed from the patient in order to aid in balancing the fluid level
      of the patient (column 10, lines 33-45)(column 3, lines 65-67).\\nIn regards
      to claim 35, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Fowle, Del
      Bigio et al is silent about a volume transducer and a treatment controller comprising
      a microprocessor, a memory device, an input device, the volume transducer, and
      an output means. Treu et al teaches a system (Figures 1 and 7) comprising a
      volume transducer (means [124]) for developing a signal indicative of the volume
      of treatment fluid and recruited fluid (column 10, lines 41-45) and a treatment
      controller (processing controller [16]), the treatment controller comprising:
      a microprocessor (column 5, lines 21-22), a memory device associated with the
      microprocessor (column 5, line 38), a input device (interface [50])(input device
      [54]) associated with the microprocessor for receiving input signals, the volume
      transducer coupled to the input number='18'device (column 3, lines 65-67), and
      an output means associated with the microprocessor for delivering output signals
      (column 5, lines 21-44)(column 10, lines 33-45). It would have been obvious
      to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made
      to modify the modified system, of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Fowle, with a
      volume transducer and a treatment controller having a microprocessor, a memory
      device, an input device, the volume transducer, and an output means, as taught
      by Treu et al, as the volume transducer will provide an efficient means for
      monitoring the volume of excess fluid removed from the patient in order to aid
      in balancing the fluid level of the patient (column 10, lines 33-45)(column
      3, lines 65-67) and the treatment controller will govern the interactions within
      the system by providing the user with the current status of the system, prompting
      the user to input commands and information or receive data from the various
      sensors and other components, recording data in memory, controlling the operation
      of the active components of the system, or alerting the patient to abnormal
      or failure conditions in the system (column 5, lines 21-44).\\nIn regards to
      claim 36, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle, and Treu
      et al, Del Bigio et al does not teach a microprocessor and memory device. Treu
      et al teaches that the microprocessor and memory device are operable to develop
      a control signal to adjust a flow rate in the treatment-fluid delivery unit
      (column 9, lines 57-62)(column 10, lines 1-7). It would have been obvious to
      a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made
      to modify the modified system, of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle, and Treu et
      al, to adjust a flow rate in the treatment-fluid delivery unit, as taught by
      Treu et al, as adjusting the flow rate will help at least partially maintain
      a normal physiologic fluid and electrolytic balance in the patient (column 9,
      lines 52-54).\\nnumber='19'In regards to claim 37, in the modified system of
      Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle, and Treu et al, Del Bigio et al does not teach
      that the treatment-fluid delivery unit comprises a heating element and the system
      comprises an inbound conduit temperature transducer coupled to the treatment
      controller. Treu et al teaches that the treatment-fluid delivery unit comprises
      a heating element (column 9, lines 4-10). It would have been obvious to a person
      having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to modify
      the modified system, of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle, and Treu et al, with
      a heating element, as taught by Treu et al, as such will heat the treatment
      fluid to body temperature (column 9, lines 4-10), which will be more comfortable
      to the patient. However, Treu et al is silent about an inbound conduit temperature
      transducer. But it would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill
      in the art at the time the invention was made to modify the modified system,
      of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle, and Treu et al, with an inbound conduit temperature
      transducer, as common practice in the art, as such will allow the treatment
      controller to sense and determine whether or not the treatment fluid is at an
      acceptable temperature, such as body temperature, for delivery to the patient.
      If the treatment fluid is not at an acceptable temperature, the treatment controller
      will direct the heating element to operate and regulate the temperature of the
      treatment fluid.\\n Claims 43-46 are rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a)
      as being unpatentable over Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Fowle, as applied to
      claim 42 above, and further in view of Lockwood et al.\\nIn regards to claim
      43, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Fowle, Del Bigio
      et al is silent about whether the open-cavity, reduced-pressure subsystem comprises
      a number='20'treatment device, a manifold, a sealing member, a reduced-pressure
      delivery conduit, and a reduced-pressure interface. Lockwood et al teaches a
      system wherein an open-cavity, reduced-pressure subsystem (Figures 1-7) comprises:
      \\na treatment device comprising:\\na fenestrated non-adherent drape (member
      [20])\\na plurality of encapsulated leg members (channels [28]) coupled to the
      non-adherent drape, each having an interior portion with a leg manifold member
      [28] and formed with fenestrations (holes [36]) operable to allow fluid flow
      into the interior portion\\na central connection member (channels [30]) fluidly
      coupled to the plurality of encapsulated legs, the central connection member
      having a first side (Figure 4) and a second, patient-facing side\\na manifold
      (vacuum/irrigation tube [13]) for disposing proximate the first side of the
      central connection member and operable to manifold reduced pressure to the central
      connection member \\na sealing member (sealing film [62]) for disposing on a
      portion of the patient\u2019s epidermis and operable to form a pneumatic seal
      over the body cavity\\na reduced-pressure delivery conduit (between vacuum source
      [12] and valve [66])\\na reduced-pressure interface (valve [66]) for coupling
      to the sealing member and operable to fluidly couple the reduced-pressure delivery
      conduit to the manifold\\nIt would have been obvious to a person having ordinary
      skill in the art at the time the invention was made to modify the open-cavity,
      reduced-pressure subsystem, of the modified system of Del number='21'Bigio et
      al, Odland, and Fowle, to comprise a treatment device, a manifold, a sealing
      member, a reduced-pressure delivery conduit, and a reduced-pressure interface,
      as taught by Lockwood et al, as such will promote the healing of a large wound
      by providing vacuum therapy to the wound to promote blood flow and remove exudate
      from a wound surface of the wound (column 7, lines 54-57).\\n\\tIn regards to
      claim 44, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle, and Lockwood
      et al, Del Bigio et al is silent about a central connection member. Lockwood
      et al teaches that the central connection member has a connection manifold member
      [30] and wherein each leg manifold member is in fluid communication with the
      connection manifold member (Figure 4). It would have been obvious to a person
      having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to modify
      the central connection member, of the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland,
      Fowle, and Lockwood et al, to have a connection manifold member, as taught by
      Lockwood et al, as such will promote the healing of a large wound by providing
      vacuum therapy to the wound to promote blood flow and remove exudate from a
      wound surface of the wound (column 7, lines 54-57).\\nIn regards to claim 45,
      in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle, and Lockwood et al,
      Del Bigio et al is silent about the plurality of encapsulated leg members. Lockwood
      et al teaches that the outbound conduit [13] and inbound conduit [13] are coupled
      to at least one of the plurality of encapsulated leg members (Figure 5). It
      would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the
      time the invention was made to modify the outbound conduit and inbound conduit,
      of the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle, and Lockwood et al,
      to be coupled to at least one of the plurality of encapsulated leg number='22'members,
      as taught by Lockwood et al, as such will promote the healing of a large wound
      by providing vacuum therapy to the wound to promote blood flow and remove exudate
      from a wound surface of the wound (column 7, lines 54-57).\\nIn regards to claim
      46, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle, and Lockwood et
      al, Del Bigio et al is silent about the plurality of encapsulated leg members.
      Lockwood et al teaches that each encapsulated leg member of the plurality of
      encapsulated leg members comprises:\\na fenestrated first leg encapsulating
      member [28]\\na fenestrated second leg encapsulating member [28]\\nwherein the
      leg manifold member has a first side, a second side, a first lateral edge, and
      a second lateral edge (Figure 4)\\nwherein the first leg encapsulating member
      is disposed proximate the first side of the leg manifold member, the second
      leg encapsulating member is disposed proximate the second patient-facing side
      of the leg manifold member, and the first leg encapsulating member and second
      leg encapsulating member are coupled proximate the first lateral edge and second
      lateral edge of the leg manifold member to form the first encapsulated leg member
      (Figure 4)\\nIt would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in
      the art at the time the invention was made to modify each encapsulated leg member,
      of the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle, and Lockwood et al,
      to comprise a fenestrated first leg encapsulating member and a fenestrated second
      leg encapsulating member, as taught by Lockwood et al, as such will number='23'promote
      the healing of a large wound by providing vacuum therapy to the wound to promote
      blood flow and remove exudate from a wound surface of the wound (column 7, lines

      nonstatutory double patenting rejection is based on a judicially created doctrine
      grounded in public policy (a policy reflected in the statute) so as to prevent
      the unjustified or improper timewise extension of the \u201Cright to exclude\u201D
      granted by a patent and to prevent possible harassment by multiple assignees.
      A nonstatutory double patenting rejection is appropriate where the claims at
      issue are not identical, but at least one examined application claim is not
      patentably distinct from the reference claim(s) because the examined application
      claim is either anticipated by, or would have been obvious over, the reference
      claim(s). See, e.g., In re Berg, 140 F.3d 1428, 46 USPQ2d 1226 (Fed. Cir. 1998);

      an actual or provisional rejection based on a nonstatutory double patenting
      ground provided the reference application or patent either is shown to be commonly
      owned with this application, or claims an invention made as a result of activities
      undertaken within the scope of a joint research agreement. See MPEP \xA7 717.02

      1-8, 11-19, 33-37, and 40-46 are rejected on the ground of nonstatutory double
      patenting as being unpatentable over claims 1-5 and 8-15 of U.S. Patent No.
      8,216,175. \\nAlthough the claims at issue are not identical, they are not patentably
      distinct from each other because both the application claims and the patent
      claims at least recite a fluid removal system for removing fluid from a tissue
      site, a semi-permeable inbound conduit, a treatment-fluid delivery unit, a semi-permeable
      outbound conduit, a treatment-fluid collector, a conduit interface, a plurality
      of tributary conduits, and wherein the treatment fluid is hyperosmotic with
      respect to the tissue site and comprises a dry gas.\\n\\nClaim Rejections -
      35 USC \xA7 103\\nThe following is a quotation of pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a)
      which forms the basis for all obviousness rejections set forth in this Office
      action:\\n(a) A patent may not be obtained though the invention is not identically
      disclosed or described as set forth in section 102 of this title, if the differences
      between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such
      that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention
      was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject
      matter pertains.  Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which
      the invention was made.\\n\\n\\nClaims 1, 3, 8, and 11 are rejected under pre-AIA
      \ 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Del Bigio et al (US 2009/0048582),
      and further in view of Odland (US 6,537,241).\\nIn regards to claim 1, Del Bigio
      et al teaches a fluid removal system (Figure 7) for removing fluid from a tissue
      site, comprising:\\nan inbound conduit (inflow tubing [7]) for placement proximate
      to the tissue site \\na treatment-fluid delivery unit (reservoir of dialysis
      fluid) adapted to be fluidly coupled to the inbound conduit for delivering a
      treatment fluid (dialysis fluid) to the inbound conduit (paragraph [0041])\\nan
      outbound conduit (outflow tubing [7]) for placement proximate to the tissue
      site, the outbound conduit fluidly coupled to the inbound conduit \\na treatment-fluid
      collector (waste reservoir) adapted to be fluidly coupled to the outbound conduit
      for receiving the treatment fluid and a recruited fluid from the tissue site
      (paragraph [0041])\\na conduit interface (osmotic cell with semipermeable membrane
      [6]) for coupling the inbound conduit and the outbound conduit\\nDel Bigio et
      al is silent about whether the inbound conduit and the outbound conduit are
      semi-permeable, as Del Bigio et al only states an osmotic cell with semipermeable
      membrane [6] between the inbound conduit and the outbound conduit (Figure 7).
      Odland teaches a system (Figures 26-27) comprising a semi-permeable inbound
      conduit (second lumen [230]) and a semi-permeable outbound conduit (semipermeable
      membranes [232]). It would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill
      in the art at the time the invention was made to modify the inbound conduit
      and the outbound conduit, of the system of Del Bigio et al, to be semi-permeable,
      as  taught by Odland, as such will provide further areas in addition to the
      osmotic cell for site specific microdialysis for recovering fluid from the tissue
      site and will provide an optimal combination of properties such as mass transfer
      properties and biocompatibility (Abstract)(column 33, lines 16-18). Further,
      Del Bigio et al does not teach that the conduit interface comprises a plurality
      of tributary conduits, as Del Bigio et al only teaches a single conduit [6].
      But it would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art
      at the time the invention was made to modify the conduit interface, of the modified
      system of Del Bigio et al and Odland, to comprise a plurality of tributary conduits,
      as either configuration between the inbound conduit and the outbound conduit
      will allow for excess water and small molecules to be efficiently drawn from
      the surface of the brain, through osmotic forces, thereby reducing brain swelling.\\n\\tIn
      regards to claim 3, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al and Odland, Del
      Bigio et al teaches that the treatment fluid is disposed within the inbound
      conduit and outbound conduit, wherein the treatment fluid is a Dextran solution
      (Abstract).\\n\\tIn regards to claim 8, in the modified system of Del Bigio
      et al and Odland, Del Bigio et al does not teach tributary conduits. But it
      would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the
      time the invention was made to modify the tributary conduits, of the modified
      system of Del Bigio et al and Odland, to be sized and provided in a quantity
      to provide a desired surface area, as such will allow for excess water and small
      molecules to be efficiently drawn from the surface of the brain, through osmotic
      forces, thereby reducing brain swelling.\\n \\tIn regards to claim 11, in the
      modified system of Del Bigio et al and Odland, Del Bigio et al teaches an open-cavity
      (Figure 7), reduced-pressure (Abstract) subsystem (mechanical pumping system)
      for removing fluids from a body cavity of a patient (paragraph [0041]).\\n\\nClaims
      2 and 4-6 are rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable
      over Del Bigio et al and Odland, as applied to claim 1 above, and further in
      view of Treu et al (US 6,254,567).\\nIn regards to claim 2, in the modified
      system of Del Bigio et al and Odland, Del Bigio et al is silent about a recruited-fluid
      determination unit coupled to the treatment-fluid collector for determining
      a volume of the recruited fluid. Treu et al teaches a system (Figure 7) wherein
      a recruited-fluid determination unit (fluid removal module [118]) is coupled
      to a treatment fluid collector (waste module [46]) for determining a volume
      of a recruited fluid. It would have been obvious to a person having ordinary
      skill in the art at the time the invention was made to modify the modified system,
      of Del Bigio et al and Odland, with a recruited-fluid determination unit, as
      taught by Treu et al, as such will provide an efficient means for monitoring
      the volume of excess fluid removed from the patient in order to aid in balancing
      the fluid level of the patient (column 10, lines 33-45)(column 3, lines 65-67).\\nIn
      regards to claim 4, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al and Odland, Del
      Bigio et al is silent about a volume transducer and a treatment controller comprising
      a microprocessor, a memory device, an input device, the volume transducer, and
      an output means. Treu et al teaches a system (Figures 1 and 7) comprising a
      volume transducer (means [124]) for developing a signal indicative of the volume
      of treatment fluid and recruited fluid (column 10, lines 41-45)  and a treatment
      controller (processing controller [16]), the treatment controller comprising:
      a microprocessor (column 5, lines 21-22), a memory device associated with the
      microprocessor (column 5, line 38), a input device (interface [50])(input device
      [54]) associated with the microprocessor for receiving input signals, the volume
      transducer coupled to the input device (column 3, lines 65-67), and an output
      means associated with the microprocessor for delivering output signals (column
      5, lines 21-44)(column 10, lines 33-45). It would have been obvious to a person
      having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to modify
      the modified system, of Del Bigio et al and Odland, with a volume transducer
      and a treatment controller having a microprocessor, a memory device, an input
      device, the volume transducer, and an output means, as taught by Treu et al,
      as the volume transducer will provide an efficient means for monitoring the
      volume of excess fluid removed from the patient in order to aid in balancing
      the fluid level of the patient (column 10, lines 33-45)(column 3, lines 65-67)
      and the treatment controller will govern the interactions within the system
      by providing the user with the current status of the system, prompting the user
      to input commands and information or receive data from the various sensors and
      other components, recording data in memory, controlling the operation of the
      active components of the system, or alerting the patient to abnormal or failure
      conditions in the system (column 5, lines 21-44).\\nIn regards to claim 5, in
      the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Treu et al, Del Bigio et
      al does not teach a microprocessor and memory device. Treu et al teaches that
      the microprocessor and memory device are operable to develop a control signal
      to adjust a flow rate in the treatment-fluid delivery unit (column 9, lines
      57-62)(column 10, lines 1-7). It would have been obvious to a person having
      ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to number='10'modify
      the modified system, of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Treu et al, to adjust a
      flow rate in the treatment-fluid delivery unit, as taught by Treu et al, as
      adjusting the flow rate will help at least partially maintain a normal physiologic
      fluid and electrolytic balance in the patient (column 9, lines 52-54).\\nIn
      regards to claim 6, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Treu
      et al, Del Bigio et al does not teach that the treatment-fluid delivery unit
      comprises a heating element and the system comprises an inbound conduit temperature
      transducer coupled to the treatment controller. Treu et al teaches that the
      treatment-fluid delivery unit comprises a heating element (column 9, lines 4-10).
      It would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the
      time the invention was made to modify the modified system, of Del Bigio et al,
      Odland, and Treu et al, with a heating element, as taught by Treu et al, as
      such will heat the treatment fluid to body temperature (column 9, lines 4-10),
      which will be more comfortable to the patient. However, Treu et al is silent
      about an inbound conduit temperature transducer. But it would have been obvious
      to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made
      to modify the modified system, of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Treu et al, with
      an inbound conduit temperature transducer, as common practice in the art, as
      such will allow the treatment controller to sense and determine whether or not
      the treatment fluid is at an acceptable temperature, such as body temperature,
      for delivery to the patient. If the treatment fluid is not at an acceptable
      temperature, the treatment controller will direct the heating element to operate
      and regulate the temperature of the treatment fluid.\\n\\nClaims 12-15 and 19
      are rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Del
      Bigio et al and Odland, as applied to claim 11 above, and further in view of
      Lockwood et al (US 6,752,794).\\nIn regards to claim 12, in the modified system
      of Del Bigio et al and Odland, Del Bigio et al is silent about whether the open-cavity,
      reduced-pressure subsystem comprises a treatment device, a manifold, a sealing
      member, a reduced-pressure delivery conduit, and a reduced-pressure interface.
      Lockwood et al teaches a system wherein an open-cavity, reduced-pressure subsystem
      (Figures 1-7) comprises: \\na treatment device comprising:\\na fenestrated non-adherent
      drape (member [20])\\na plurality of encapsulated leg members (channels [28])
      coupled to the non-adherent drape, each having an interior portion with a leg
      manifold member [28] and formed with fenestrations (holes [36]) operable to
      allow fluid flow into the interior portion\\na central connection member (channels
      [30]) fluidly coupled to the plurality of encapsulated legs, the central connection
      member having a first side (Figure 4) and a second, patient-facing side\\na
      manifold (vacuum/irrigation tube [13]) for disposing proximate the first side
      of the central connection member and operable to manifold reduced pressure to
      the central connection member \\na sealing member (sealing film [62]) for disposing
      on a portion of the patient\u2019s epidermis and operable to form a pneumatic
      seal over the body cavitynumber='11'\\na reduced-pressure delivery conduit (between
      vacuum source [12] and valve [66])\\na reduced-pressure interface (valve [66])
      for coupling to the sealing member and operable to fluidly couple the reduced-pressure
      delivery conduit to the manifold\\nIt would have been obvious to a person having
      ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to modify the open-cavity,
      reduced-pressure subsystem, of the modified system of Del Bigio et al and Odland,
      to comprise a treatment device, a manifold, a sealing member, a reduced-pressure
      delivery conduit, and a reduced-pressure interface, as taught by Lockwood et
      al, as such will promote the healing of a large wound by providing vacuum therapy
      to the wound to promote blood flow and remove exudate from a wound surface of
      the wound (column 7, lines 54-57).\\n\\tIn regards to claim 13, in the modified
      system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Lockwood et al, Del Bigio et al is silent
      about a central connection member. Lockwood et al teaches that the central connection
      member has a connection manifold member [30] and wherein each leg manifold member
      is in fluid communication with the connection manifold member (Figure 4). It
      would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the
      time the invention was made to modify the central connection member, of the
      modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Lockwood et al, to have a connection
      manifold member, as taught by Lockwood et al, as such will promote the healing
      of a large wound by providing vacuum therapy to the wound to promote blood flow
      and remove exudate from a wound surface of the wound (column 7, lines 54-57).\\nIn
      regards to claim 14, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and
      Lockwood et al, Del Bigio et al is silent about the plurality of encapsulated
      leg members. Lockwood et al teaches that the outbound conduit [13] and inbound
      conduit [13] are coupled to at least one of the number='12'plurality of encapsulated
      leg members (Figure 5). It would have been obvious to a person having ordinary
      skill in the art at the time the invention was made to modify the outbound conduit
      and inbound conduit, of the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and
      Lockwood et al, to be coupled to at least one of the plurality of encapsulated
      leg members, as taught by Lockwood et al, as such will promote the healing of
      a large wound by providing vacuum therapy to the wound to promote blood flow
      and remove exudate from a wound surface of the wound (column 7, lines 54-57).\\nIn
      regards to claim 15, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and
      Lockwood et al, Del Bigio et al teaches a treatment fluid disposed within the
      inbound conduit and outbound conduit, wherein the treatment fluid is a Dextran
      solution (Abstract).\\nIn regards to claim 19, in the modified system of Del
      Bigio et al, Odland, and Lockwood et al, Del Bigio et al is silent about the
      plurality of encapsulated leg members. Lockwood et al teaches that each encapsulated
      leg member of the plurality of encapsulated leg members comprises:\\na fenestrated
      first leg encapsulating member [28]\\na fenestrated second leg encapsulating
      member [28]\\nwherein the leg manifold member has a first side, a second side,
      a first lateral edge, and a second lateral edge (Figure 4)\\nwherein the first
      leg encapsulating member is disposed proximate the first side of the leg manifold
      member, the second leg encapsulating member is disposed proximate the second
      patient-facing side of the leg manifold member, and the first leg encapsulating
      member and second leg encapsulating member are coupled proximate number='13'the
      first lateral edge and second lateral edge of the leg manifold member to form
      the first encapsulated leg member (Figure 4)\\nIt would have been obvious to
      a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made
      to modify each encapsulated leg member, of the modified system of Del Bigio
      et al, Odland, and Lockwood et al, to comprise a fenestrated first leg encapsulating
      member and a fenestrated second leg encapsulating member, as taught by Lockwood
      et al, as such will promote the healing of a large wound by providing vacuum
      therapy to the wound to promote blood flow and remove exudate from a wound surface
      of the wound (column 7, lines 54-57).\\n\\nClaims 16-18 are rejected under pre-AIA
      \ 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Lockwood
      et al, as applied to claim 12 above, and further in view of Treu et al.\\nIn
      regards to claim 16, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and
      Lockwood et al, Del Bigio et al is silent about a volume transducer and a treatment
      controller comprising a microprocessor, a memory device, an input device, the
      volume transducer, and an output device. Treu et al teaches a system (Figures
      1 and 7) comprising a volume transducer (means [124]) for developing a signal
      indicative of the volume of treatment fluid and recruited fluid (column 10,
      lines 41-45) and a treatment controller (processing controller [16]), the treatment
      controller comprising: a microprocessor (column 5, lines 21-22), a memory device
      associated with the microprocessor (column 5, line 38), a input device (interface
      [50])(input device [54]) associated with the microprocessor for receiving input
      signals, the volume transducer coupled to the input device (column 3, lines
      65-67), and an output device associated with the microprocessor for number='14'delivering
      output signals (column 5, lines 21-44)(column 10, lines 33-45). It would have
      been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention
      was made to modify the modified system, of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Lockwood
      et al, with a volume transducer and a treatment controller having a microprocessor,
      a memory device, an input device, the volume transducer, and an output device,
      as taught by Treu et al, as the volume transducer will provide an efficient
      means for monitoring the volume of excess fluid removed from the patient in
      order to aid in balancing the fluid level of the patient (column 10, lines 33-45)(column
      3, lines 65-67) and the treatment controller will govern the interactions within
      the system by providing the user with the current status of the system, prompting
      the user to input commands and information or receive data from the various
      sensors and other components, recording data in memory, controlling the operation
      of the active components of the system, or alerting the patient to abnormal
      or failure conditions in the system (column 5, lines 21-44).\\nIn regards to
      claim 17, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Lockwood et al,
      and Treu et al, Del Bigio et al does not teach a microprocessor and memory device.
      Treu et al teaches that the microprocessor and memory device are operable to
      develop a control signal to adjust a flow rate in the treatment-fluid delivery
      unit (column 9, lines 57-62)(column 10, lines 1-7). It would have been obvious
      to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made
      to modify the modified system, of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Lockwood et al, and
      Treu et al, to adjust a flow rate in the treatment-fluid delivery unit, as taught
      by Treu et al, as adjusting the flow rate will help at least partially maintain
      a normal physiologic fluid and electrolytic balance in the patient (column 9,
      lines 52-54).\\nnumber='15'In regards to claim 18, in the modified system of
      Del Bigio et al, Odland, Lockwood et al, and Treu et al, Del Bigio et al does
      not teach that the treatment-fluid delivery unit comprises a heating element
      and the system comprises an inbound conduit temperature transducer coupled to
      the treatment controller. Treu et al teaches that the treatment-fluid delivery
      unit comprises a heating element (column 9, lines 4-10). It would have been
      obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention
      was made to modify the modified system, of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Lockwood
      et al, and Treu et al, with a heating element, as taught by Treu et al, as such
      will heat the treatment fluid to body temperature (column 9, lines 4-10), which
      will be more comfortable to the patient. However, Treu et al is silent about
      an inbound conduit temperature transducer. But it would have been obvious to
      a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made
      to modify the modified system, of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Lockwood et al, and
      Treu et al, with an inbound conduit temperature transducer, as common practice
      in the art, as such will allow the treatment controller to sense and determine
      whether or not the treatment fluid is at an acceptable temperature, such as
      body temperature, for delivery to the patient. If the treatment fluid is not
      at an acceptable temperature, the treatment controller will direct the heating
      element to operate and regulate the temperature of the treatment fluid.\\n\\nClaims
      33, 40, and 42 are rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable
      over Del Bigio et al, and further in view of Odland and Fowle.\\nIn regards
      to claim 33, Del Bigio et al teaches a system (Figure 7) for removing fluid
      from a tissue site, comprising:\\nan inbound conduit (inflow tubing [7]) for
      placement proximate to the tissue site number='16'\\na treatment-fluid delivery
      unit (reservoir of dialysis fluid) adapted to be fluidly coupled to the inbound
      conduit for delivering a treatment fluid (dialysis fluid) to the inbound conduit
      (paragraph [0041])\\nan outbound conduit (outflow tubing [7]) for placement
      proximate to the tissue site, the outbound conduit fluidly coupled to the inbound
      conduit \\na treatment-fluid collector (waste reservoir) adapted to be fluidly
      coupled to the outbound conduit for receiving the treatment fluid and a recruited
      fluid from the tissue site (paragraph [0041])\\nwherein the treatment fluid
      is hyperosmotic (hyperosmolar) with respect to the tissue site (Abstract)\\nDel
      Bigio et al is silent about whether the inbound conduit and the outbound conduit
      are semi-permeable, as Del Bigio et al only states an osmotic cell with semipermeable
      membrane [6] between the inbound conduit and the outbound conduit (Figure 7).
      Odland teaches a system (Figures 26-27) comprising a semi-permeable inbound
      conduit (second lumen [230]) and a semi-permeable outbound conduit (semipermeable
      membranes [232]). It would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill
      in the art at the time the invention was made to modify the inbound conduit
      and the outbound conduit, of the system of Del Bigio et al, to be semi-permeable,
      as taught by Odland, as such will provide further areas in addition to the osmotic
      cell for site specific microdialysis for recovering fluid from the tissue site
      and will provide an optimal combination of properties such as mass transfer
      properties and biocompatibility (Abstract)(column 33, lines 16-18). Further,
      Del Bigio et al does not appear to teach that the treatment fluid comprises
      a dry gas. Fowle teaches a system (Figures 1-3) wherein a number='17'treatment
      fluid comprises a dry gas (dry inert gas stream [36]). It would have been obvious
      to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made
      to modify the treatment fluid, of the modified system of Del Bigio et al and
      Odland, to comprise a dry gas, as taught by Fowle, as such will allow for transporting
      cryogenic droplets to the distal end of the conduit for cooling a cold-tip (Abstract),
      which can be manipulated to destroy a small amount of brain tissue (the thalamus)
      by freezing it (column 1, lines 13-19).\\n\\tIn regards to claim 40, in the
      modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Fowle, Del Bigio et al teaches
      a conduit interface (osmotic cell with semipermeable membrane [6]) for coupling
      the inbound conduit and the outbound conduit; however, Del Bigio et al does
      not teach that the conduit interface comprises a plurality of tributary conduits,
      as Del Bigio et al only teaches a single conduit [6]. But it would have been
      obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention
      was made to modify the conduit interface, of the modified system of Del Bigio
      et al, Odland, and Fowle, to comprise a plurality of tributary conduits, as
      either configuration between the inbound conduit and the outbound conduit will
      allow for excess water and small molecules to be efficiently drawn from the
      surface of the brain, through osmotic forces, thereby reducing brain swelling.\\n\\tIn
      regards to claim 42, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and
      Fowle, Del Bigio et al teaches an open-cavity (Figure 7), reduced-pressure (Abstract)
      subsystem (mechanical pumping system) for removing fluids from a body cavity
      of a patient (paragraph [0041]).\\n\\nClaims 34-37 are rejected under pre-AIA
      \ 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Fowle,
      as applied to claim 33 above, and further in view of Treu et al.\\nIn regards
      to claim 34, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Fowle, Del
      Bigio et al is silent about a recruited-fluid determination unit coupled to
      the treatment-fluid collector for determining a volume of the recruited fluid.
      Treu et al teaches a system (Figure 7) wherein a recruited-fluid determination
      unit (fluid removal module [118]) is coupled to a treatment fluid collector
      (waste module [46]) for determining a volume of a recruited fluid. It would
      have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the
      invention was made to modify the modified system, of Del Bigio et al, Odland,
      and Fowle, with a recruited-fluid determination unit, as taught by Treu et al,
      as such will provide an efficient means for monitoring the volume of excess
      fluid removed from the patient in order to aid in balancing the fluid level
      of the patient (column 10, lines 33-45)(column 3, lines 65-67).\\nIn regards
      to claim 35, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Fowle, Del
      Bigio et al is silent about a volume transducer and a treatment controller comprising
      a microprocessor, a memory device, an input device, the volume transducer, and
      an output means. Treu et al teaches a system (Figures 1 and 7) comprising a
      volume transducer (means [124]) for developing a signal indicative of the volume
      of treatment fluid and recruited fluid (column 10, lines 41-45) and a treatment
      controller (processing controller [16]), the treatment controller comprising:
      a microprocessor (column 5, lines 21-22), a memory device associated with the
      microprocessor (column 5, line 38), a input device (interface [50])(input device
      [54]) associated with the microprocessor for receiving input signals, the volume
      transducer coupled to the input number='18'device (column 3, lines 65-67), and
      an output means associated with the microprocessor for delivering output signals
      (column 5, lines 21-44)(column 10, lines 33-45). It would have been obvious
      to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made
      to modify the modified system, of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Fowle, with a
      volume transducer and a treatment controller having a microprocessor, a memory
      device, an input device, the volume transducer, and an output means, as taught
      by Treu et al, as the volume transducer will provide an efficient means for
      monitoring the volume of excess fluid removed from the patient in order to aid
      in balancing the fluid level of the patient (column 10, lines 33-45)(column
      3, lines 65-67) and the treatment controller will govern the interactions within
      the system by providing the user with the current status of the system, prompting
      the user to input commands and information or receive data from the various
      sensors and other components, recording data in memory, controlling the operation
      of the active components of the system, or alerting the patient to abnormal
      or failure conditions in the system (column 5, lines 21-44).\\nIn regards to
      claim 36, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle, and Treu
      et al, Del Bigio et al does not teach a microprocessor and memory device. Treu
      et al teaches that the microprocessor and memory device are operable to develop
      a control signal to adjust a flow rate in the treatment-fluid delivery unit
      (column 9, lines 57-62)(column 10, lines 1-7). It would have been obvious to
      a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made
      to modify the modified system, of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle, and Treu et
      al, to adjust a flow rate in the treatment-fluid delivery unit, as taught by
      Treu et al, as adjusting the flow rate will help at least partially maintain
      a normal physiologic fluid and electrolytic balance in the patient (column 9,
      lines 52-54).\\nnumber='19'In regards to claim 37, in the modified system of
      Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle, and Treu et al, Del Bigio et al does not teach
      that the treatment-fluid delivery unit comprises a heating element and the system
      comprises an inbound conduit temperature transducer coupled to the treatment
      controller. Treu et al teaches that the treatment-fluid delivery unit comprises
      a heating element (column 9, lines 4-10). It would have been obvious to a person
      having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to modify
      the modified system, of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle, and Treu et al, with
      a heating element, as taught by Treu et al, as such will heat the treatment
      fluid to body temperature (column 9, lines 4-10), which will be more comfortable
      to the patient. However, Treu et al is silent about an inbound conduit temperature
      transducer. But it would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill
      in the art at the time the invention was made to modify the modified system,
      of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle, and Treu et al, with an inbound conduit temperature
      transducer, as common practice in the art, as such will allow the treatment
      controller to sense and determine whether or not the treatment fluid is at an
      acceptable temperature, such as body temperature, for delivery to the patient.
      If the treatment fluid is not at an acceptable temperature, the treatment controller
      will direct the heating element to operate and regulate the temperature of the
      treatment fluid.\\n\\nClaims 43-46 are rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a)
      as being unpatentable over Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Fowle, as applied to
      claim 42 above, and further in view of Lockwood et al.\\nIn regards to claim
      43, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, and Fowle, Del Bigio
      et al is silent about whether the open-cavity, reduced-pressure subsystem comprises
      a number='20'treatment device, a manifold, a sealing member, a reduced-pressure
      delivery conduit, and a reduced-pressure interface. Lockwood et al teaches a
      system wherein an open-cavity, reduced-pressure subsystem (Figures 1-7) comprises:
      \\na treatment device comprising:\\na fenestrated non-adherent drape (member
      [20])\\na plurality of encapsulated leg members (channels [28]) coupled to the
      non-adherent drape, each having an interior portion with a leg manifold member
      [28] and formed with fenestrations (holes [36]) operable to allow fluid flow
      into the interior portion\\na central connection member (channels [30]) fluidly
      coupled to the plurality of encapsulated legs, the central connection member
      having a first side (Figure 4) and a second, patient-facing side\\na manifold
      (vacuum/irrigation tube [13]) for disposing proximate the first side of the
      central connection member and operable to manifold reduced pressure to the central
      connection member \\na sealing member (sealing film [62]) for disposing on a
      portion of the patient\u2019s epidermis and operable to form a pneumatic seal
      over the body cavity\\na reduced-pressure delivery conduit (between vacuum source
      [12] and valve [66])\\na reduced-pressure interface (valve [66]) for coupling
      to the sealing member and operable to fluidly couple the reduced-pressure delivery
      conduit to the manifold\\nIt would have been obvious to a person having ordinary
      skill in the art at the time the invention was made to modify the open-cavity,
      reduced-pressure subsystem, of the modified system of Del number='21'Bigio et
      al, Odland, and Fowle, to comprise a treatment device, a manifold, a sealing
      member, a reduced-pressure delivery conduit, and a reduced-pressure interface,
      as taught by Lockwood et al, as such will promote the healing of a large wound
      by providing vacuum therapy to the wound to promote blood flow and remove exudate
      from a wound surface of the wound (column 7, lines 54-57).\\n\\tIn regards to
      claim 44, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle, and Lockwood
      et al, Del Bigio et al is silent about a central connection member. Lockwood
      et al teaches that the central connection member has a connection manifold member
      [30] and wherein each leg manifold member is in fluid communication with the
      connection manifold member (Figure 4). It would have been obvious to a person
      having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to modify
      the central connection member, of the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland,
      Fowle, and Lockwood et al, to have a connection manifold member, as taught by
      Lockwood et al, as such will promote the healing of a large wound by providing
      vacuum therapy to the wound to promote blood flow and remove exudate from a
      wound surface of the wound (column 7, lines 54-57).\\nIn regards to claim 45,
      in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle, and Lockwood et al,
      Del Bigio et al is silent about the plurality of encapsulated leg members. Lockwood
      et al teaches that the outbound conduit [13] and inbound conduit [13] are coupled
      to at least one of the plurality of encapsulated leg members (Figure 5). It
      would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the
      time the invention was made to modify the outbound conduit and inbound conduit,
      of the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle, and Lockwood et al,
      to be coupled to at least one of the plurality of encapsulated leg number='22'members,
      as taught by Lockwood et al, as such will promote the healing of a large wound
      by providing vacuum therapy to the wound to promote blood flow and remove exudate
      from a wound surface of the wound (column 7, lines 54-57).\\nIn regards to claim
      46, in the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle, and Lockwood et
      al, Del Bigio et al is silent about the plurality of encapsulated leg members.
      Lockwood et al teaches that each encapsulated leg member of the plurality of
      encapsulated leg members comprises:\\na fenestrated first leg encapsulating
      member [28]\\na fenestrated second leg encapsulating member [28]\\nwherein the
      leg manifold member has a first side, a second side, a first lateral edge, and
      a second lateral edge (Figure 4)\\nwherein the first leg encapsulating member
      is disposed proximate the first side of the leg manifold member, the second
      leg encapsulating member is disposed proximate the second patient-facing side
      of the leg manifold member, and the first leg encapsulating member and second
      leg encapsulating member are coupled proximate the first lateral edge and second
      lateral edge of the leg manifold member to form the first encapsulated leg member
      (Figure 4)\\nIt would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in
      the art at the time the invention was made to modify each encapsulated leg member,
      of the modified system of Del Bigio et al, Odland, Fowle, and Lockwood et al,
      to comprise a fenestrated first leg encapsulating member and a fenestrated second
      leg encapsulating member, as taught by Lockwood et al, as such will number='23'promote
      the healing of a large wound by providing vacuum therapy to the wound to promote
      blood flow and remove exudate from a wound surface of the wound (column 7, lines
