      under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Kai et al. (US Patent
      6,777,124) in view of Rim (US 6,739,579) in view of Applicant\u2019s Admitted
      Prior Art (hereinafter \u2018AAPA\u2019) and further in view of Fauni (PG Pub.
      US 2005/0263731).\\nRegarding claim 1, Kai et al. teaches a backpressure control
      valve (butterfly valve; Fig. 1, ref. no. 11) mountable in a body (pipe - ref.
      no. 12; Abstract; Figs. 2) that defines a fluid passage therein, the valve comprising:\\na
      shaft (14) cooperative with the body such that the shaft extends across the
      fluid passage (col. 4, lines 56-61).  \\nKai et al. is silent regarding the
      fluid passage being asymmetrical.  However, absent a lack of criticality and
      unexpected results, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the
      art at the time of the invention to modify the body (pipe member) of Kai et
      al. such that the body defines an asymmetrical fluid passage if such a shape
      helps with moving the water that is produced during the electrochemical reaction
      out of the oxidizing gas passage.  The change in form or shape, without any
      new or unexpected results, is an obvious engineering design. See In re Dailey,
      149 USPQ 47 (CCPA 1976) (see MPEP \xA7 2144.04).\\n Kai et al. is silent regarding
      an asymmetrical blade cooperative with the shaft within the fluid passage, wherein
      the asymmetrical blade comprises a first blade section and a second blade section
      divided by the shaft, and wherein the first blade section has a surface area
      substantially less than the surface area of the second blade section such that
      a fluid pressure in the asymmetrical fluid passage imparts a torque on the shaft
      through the asymmetrical blade.  However, Rim et al. teaches an exhaust heat
      recovery system for a combustion engine in a motor vehicle wherein the exhaust
      valve that comprises an asymmetrical blade (butterfly plate 50) eliminates bearing/bushing
      leakage under backpressure (col. 2, lines 9-13).  Rim teaches an asymmetrical
      blade cooperative with the shaft (54) within the fluid passage (col. 3, lines
      38-39), wherein the asymmetrical blade comprises a first blade section (top
      portion of butterfly plate 50) and a second blade section (bottom portion of
      butterfly plate 50) divided by the shaft, and wherein the first blade section
      has a surface area substantially less than the surface area of the second blade
      section (Fig. 5) and is fully capable of the fluid pressure in the asymmetrical
      fluid passage imparts a torque on the shaft through the asymmetrical blade.
      \ Accordingly, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art
      at the time of the invention to modify the teachings of Kai et al. by the teachings
      of Rim to use an asymmetrical blade that is divided into a first blade section
      and a second blade section in an effort to provide better exhaust sealing performance
      under backpressure for an exhaust recover system at a reduced manufacturing
      cost.  \\nModified Kai et al. is silent regarding a biasing device operatively
      connected to the asymmetrical blade, wherein the asymmetrical blade is rotatable
      between a closed  position and an open position such that: when in the closed
      position, the biasing device provides a closing torque which exceeds the torque
      imparted on the shaft from the pressurized fluid in the asymmetrical fluid passage
      to urge the asymmetrical blade to the closed position, and when in the open
      position, the pressurized fluid provides an opening torque substantially greater
      than the closing torque such that the asymmetrical blade is urged to the open
      position. \\nHowever, Fauni teaches a petrol driven internal combustion engine
      provided with a butterfly valve (para. [0002]).  Fauni also teaches that it
      is known in the art to have a biasing device (combination of torsion spiral
      return spring and a torsion spiral opposing spring) operatively connected to
      the asymmetrical blade, wherein the asymmetrical blade is rotatable between
      a closed position and an open position such that (para. [0003]):\\nwhen in the
      closed position, the biasing device provides a closing torque which exceeds
      the torque imparted on the shaft from the pressurized fluid in the asymmetrical
      fluid passage to urge the asymmetrical blade to the closed position (para. [0003];
      torque imparted on the asymmetrical blade via the shaft must be greater than
      the torque imparted on the shaft from the pressurized fluid in order to move
      the blade to the closing position), and \\nwhen in the open position, the pressurized
      fluid provides an opening torque substantially greater than the closing torque
      such that the asymmetrical blade is urged to the open position (para. [0003];
      torque imparted on the asymmetrical blade via the  shaft must be less than the
      torque imparted on the shaft from the pressurized fluid in order to move the
      blade to the opening position). \\nThe Examiner notes that \u201Ca fluid pressure
      in the asymmetrical fluid passage imparts a torque on the shaft through the
      asymmetrical blade\u201D is a function of the apparatus (see MPEP 2114) which
      occurs naturally in the structurally indistinguishable apparatus of the prior
      art.\\nRegarding claim 2, Kai et al. teaches a valve wherein the asymmetrical
      fluid passage is an oxidant passage in a fuel cell system (col. 4, lines 47-51).
      \ Kai et al. is silent regarding the valve being used in a vehicle.  However,
      Rim teaches that its butterfly valve is used in a vehicle exhaust system (col.
      2, lines 9-11).  Accordingly, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary
      skill in the art at the time of the invention to modify the teachings of Kai
      et al. by the teachings of Rim et al. as it is known in the art to use fuel
      cell systems in vehicles and butterfly valves in vehicle exhaust systems.  \\nRegarding
      claim 3,  Kai et al. teaches a valve wherein the asymmetrical fluid passage
      is an oxidant passage in a fuel cell system (col. 4, lines 47-51).  Kai et al.
      is silent regarding the asymmetrical fluid passage is an exhaust passage in
      a fuel cell system exhaust stream in a vehicle.  However, Rim teaches that its
      butterfly valve is used in a vehicle exhaust system (col. 2, lines 9-11).  Accordingly,
      it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of
      the invention to modify the teachings of Kai et al. by the teachings of Rim
      et al. as it is known in the art to use fuel cell systems in vehicles and butterfly
      valves in vehicle exhaust streams.  \\nRegarding claim 4, Kai et al. is silent
      regarding a valve wherein the asymmetrical fluid passage comprises a substantially
      ovoid shape, and the asymmetrical blade comprises a substantially ovoid shape
      that is substantially similar in size and shape to the asymmetrical fluid passage
      to define a substantially fluid tight connection therebetween.  However, absent
      a lack of criticality and unexpected results, it would have been obvious to
      one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to modify the
      teachings of Kai et al. such that the asymmetrical fluid passage comprises a
      substantially ovoid shape and the asymmetrical blade comprises a substantially
      ovoid shape as different shaped valve seats and different shaped blades are
      needed to accommodate different shaped fluid passages.  \\nRegarding claim 5,
      modified Kai et al. teaches a valve wherein the asymmetrical blade is cooperative
      with the shaft at substantially the greatest width of the asymmetrical blade
      (Rim, Fig. 5). \\nRegarding claim 6, modified Kai et al. teaches that the valve
      wherein the surface area of the first blade section is greater than the surface
      area of the second blade section (Rim, Fig. 5).  Modified Kai et al. is silent
      regarding a valve wherein the surface area of the first blade section is from
      about 60% to 110% greater than the surface area of the second blade section.
      \ However, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at
      the time of the invention to further modify the teachings of modified Kai et
      al. in the aforementioned manner if doing so provides better exhaust sealing
      performance under backpressure for an exhaust recover system at a reduced manufacturing
      cost. \u201C[W]here the general conditions of a claim are disclosed in the prior
      \ art, it is not inventive to discover the optimum or workable ranges by routine
      experimentation.\u201D See In re Aller, 220 F.2d 454, 456, 105 USPQ 233, 235
      (CCPA 1955). The discovery of an optimum value of a known result effective variable,
      without producing any new or unexpected results, is within the ambit of a person
      of ordinary skill in the art. See In re Boesch, 205 USPQ 215 (CCPA 1980) (see
      MPEP \xA7 2144.05, II.).\\nRegarding claim 9, modified Kai et al. teaches a
      valve wherein the biasing device comprises a spring (Fauni, para. [0003]). \\nRegarding
      claim 10, Kai et al. is silent regarding a valve wherein the valve further comprises
      an actuator operatively connected to the shaft.  However, Rim teaches a valve
      wherein the valve further comprises an actuator operatively connected to the
      shaft (Rim, col. 4, lines 8-10 and 35-39).  Accordingly, it would have been
      obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to
      modify the teachings of Kai et al. by the teachings of Rim in an effort to provide
      better exhaust sealing performance under backpressure for an exhaust recover
      system at a reduced manufacturing cost.  \\n Claim 7 is rejected under pre-AIA
      \ 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Kai et al. in view of Rim (US
      6,739,579) in view of Applicant\u2019s Admitted Prior Art (hereinafter \u2018AAPA\u2019)
      in view of Fauni (PG Pub. US 2005/0263731) as applied to claim 1 above, and
      further in view of Aigami (US Patent 6,155,298).\\nRegarding claim 7, modified
      Kai et al. is silent regarding a valve wherein the asymmetrical blade is provided
      within the asymmetrical fluid passage such that the asymmetrical blade forms
      a seat angle of from about 0\xB0 to about 60\xB0.  However, Aigami number='10'teaches
      it is known in the art for a valve to have a valve seat that has an angle of
      inclination between 30 degrees to 60 degrees relative to the central axis of
      the valve body (claims 1 and 6).  Accordingly, it would have been obvious to
      one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to further modify
      the teachings of modified Kai et al. by the teachings of Aigami such that the
      asymmetrical blade forms a seat angle of from about 0\xB0 to about 60\xB0 to
      better control the direction of fluid through the asymmetrical fluid passage.
      \ \\n Claim 8 is rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable
      over Kai et al. in view of Rim (US 6,739,579) in view of Applicant\u2019s Admitted
      Prior Art (hereinafter \u2018AAPA\u2019) in view of Fauni (PG Pub. US 2005/0263731)
      as applied to claim 1 above, and further in view of Hueppchen et al. (PG Pub.
      US 2006/0180541).\\nRegarding claim 8, modified Kai et al. teaches a valve wherein
      the asymmetrical blade further comprises a metal ring seal provided on an outer
      edge thereof (Rim, Fig. 5, ref. no. 60; col. 3, lines 56-58).  Modified Kai
      et al. is silent regarding a valve wherein the seal is elastomeric.  However,
      Hueppchen et al. teaches that it is known in the art to seal a valve seat through
      the use of a thin-walled metal, plastic or elastomer plate (para. [0022]).  Accordingly,
      it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of
      the invention to further modify the teachings of modified Kai et al. by the
      teachings of Hueppchen et al. in order to create a fluid tight connection between
      the asymmetrical blade and the asymmetrical passage as substituting a plastic
      or an elastomer plate for a thin-walled metal in a valve is known in the art.
      \ The simple substitution of one known element for another is likely to be obvious
      when predictable number='11'results are achieved. See KSR International Co.
      v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. __,__, 82 USPQ2d 1385, 1395 \u2013 97 (2007) (see
      MPEP \xA7 2143, B.).\\n Claim 11 is rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a)
      as being unpatentable over Kai et al. in view of Rim (US 6,739,579) in view
      of Applicant\u2019s Admitted Prior Art (hereinafter \u2018AAPA\u2019) in view
      of Fauni (PG Pub. US 2005/0263731) as applied to claim 1 above, and further
      in view of Schmid et al. (PG Pub. US 2005/01888693).\\nRegarding claim 11, modified
      Kai et al. is silent regarding a valve wherein the valve is at least one of
      passive and semi-passive.  However, Schmid et al. teaches that it is known in
      the art that butterfly valves in combustion engines are passive valves.  Accordingly,
      it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of
      the invention to modify the teachings of modified Kai et al. by the teachings
      of Schmid et al. such that the backpressure control valve is a passive valve
      in order to reduce the number of moving parts in the valve that are subject
      to mechanical failure.   \\n Claims 12 and 13 are rejected under pre-AIA  35
      U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Kai et al. (US Patent 6,777,124) in
      view of Rim (US 6,739,579) in view of Applicant\u2019s Admitted Prior Art (hereinafter
      \u2018AAPA\u2019) and further in view of Fauni (PG Pub. US 2005/0263731).\\nRegarding
      claim 12, Kai et al. teaches a fuel cell system (Abstract) comprising: \\na
      fuel cell comprising an anode and a cathode in electrolytic communication with
      an electrolyte membrane, wherein the anode and the cathode are provided on opposing
      sides of the electrolyte membrane (col. 1, lines 11-18);\\nnumber='12'a body
      that defines an oxidant passage in fluid communication with the cathode (col.
      1, lines 22-24); \\na backpressure control valve (butterfly valve; Fig. 1, ref.
      no. 11) cooperative with the body (pipe - ref. no. 12; Abstract; Figs. 2), wherein
      the valve comprises:\\na shaft (14) cooperative with the body such that the
      shaft extends across the oxidant passage (col. 4, lines 56-61).  \\nKai et al.
      is silent regarding the oxidant passage being asymmetrical.  However, absent
      a lack of criticality and unexpected results, it would have been obvious to
      one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to modify the
      body (pipe member) of Kai et al. such that the body defines an asymmetrical
      oxidant passage if such a shape helps with moving the water that is produced
      during the electrochemical reaction out of the oxidizing gas passage.  The change
      in form or shape, without any new or unexpected results, is an obvious engineering
      design. See In re Dailey, 149 USPQ 47 (CCPA 1976) (see MPEP \xA7 2144.04).\\nKai
      et al. is silent regarding an asymmetrical blade cooperative with the shaft
      within the oxidant passage, wherein the asymmetrical blade comprises a first
      blade section and a second blade section divided by the shaft, and wherein the
      first blade section has a surface area substantially less than the surface area
      of the second blade section such that a fluid pressure in the asymmetrical oxidant
      passage imparts a torque on the shaft through the asymmetrical blade.  However,
      Rim et al. teaches an asymmetrical blade (butterfly plate 50) cooperative with
      the shaft (54) within the fluid passage (col. 3, lines 38-39), wherein the asymmetrical
      blade comprises a first blade number='13'section (top portion of butterfly plate
      50) and a second blade section (bottom portion of butterfly plate 50) divided
      by the shaft, and wherein the first blade section has a surface area substantially
      less than the surface area of the second blade section (Fig. 5) and is fully
      capable of the fluid pressure in the asymmetrical fluid passage imparts a torque
      on the shaft through the asymmetrical blade.   Accordingly, it would have been
      obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to
      modify the teachings of Kai et al. by the teachings of Rim to use an asymmetrical
      blade that is divided into a first blade section and a second blade section
      in an effort to provide better exhaust sealing performance under backpressure
      for an exhaust recover system at a reduced manufacturing cost.  \\nModified
      Kai et al. is silent regarding a biasing device operatively connected to the
      asymmetrical blade, wherein the asymmetrical blade is rotatable between a closed
      position and an open position such that: when in the closed position, the biasing
      device provides a closing torque which exceeds the torque imparted on the shaft
      from the pressurized fluid in the asymmetrical oxidant passage to urge the asymmetrical
      blade to the closed position, and when in the open position, the pressurized
      fluid provides an opening torque substantially greater than the closing torque
      such that the asymmetrical blade is urged to the open position. \\nHowever,
      Fauni teaches a petrol driven internal combustion engine provided with a butterfly
      valve (para. [0002]).  Fauni also teaches that it is known in the art to have
      a biasing device (combination of torsion spiral return spring and a torsion
      spiral opposing spring) operatively connected to the asymmetrical blade, wherein
      the asymmetrical number='14'blade is rotatable between a closed position and
      an open position such that (para. [0003]):\\nwhen in the closed position, the
      biasing device provides a closing torque which exceeds the torque imparted on
      the shaft from the pressurized fluid in the asymmetrical oxidant passage to
      urge the asymmetrical blade to the closed position (para. [0003]; torque imparted
      on the asymmetrical blade via the shaft must be greater than the torque imparted
      on the shaft from the pressurized fluid in order to move the blade to the closing
      position), and \\nwhen in the open position, the pressurized fluid provides
      an opening torque substantially greater than the closing torque such that the
      asymmetrical blade is urged to the open position (para. [0003]; torque imparted
      on the asymmetrical blade via the shaft must be less than the torque imparted
      on the shaft from the pressurized fluid in order to move the blade to the opening
      position). \\nRegarding claim 13, Kai et al. is silent regarding a valve wherein
      the valve further comprises an actuator operatively connected to the shaft.
      \ However, Rim teaches a valve wherein the valve further comprises an actuator
      operatively connected to the shaft (Rim, col. 4, lines 8-10 and 35-39).  Accordingly,
      it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of
      the invention to modify the teachings of Kai et al. by the teachings of Rim
      in an effort to provide better exhaust sealing performance under backpressure
      for an exhaust recover system at a reduced manufacturing cost.  \\nnumber='15'Conclusion\\n\"],\n

      are rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Kai
      et al. (US Patent 6,777,124) in view of Rim (US 6,739,579) in view of Applicant\u2019s
      Admitted Prior Art (hereinafter \u2018AAPA\u2019) and further in view of Fauni
      (PG Pub. US 2005/0263731).\\nRegarding claim 1, Kai et al. teaches a backpressure
      control valve (butterfly valve; Fig. 1, ref. no. 11) mountable in a body (pipe
      - ref. no. 12; Abstract; Figs. 2) that defines a fluid passage therein, the
      valve comprising:\\na shaft (14) cooperative with the body such that the shaft
      extends across the fluid passage (col. 4, lines 56-61).  \\nKai et al. is silent
      regarding the fluid passage being asymmetrical.  However, absent a lack of criticality
      and unexpected results, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill
      in the art at the time of the invention to modify the body (pipe member) of
      Kai et al. such that the body defines an asymmetrical fluid passage if such
      a shape helps with moving the water that is produced during the electrochemical
      reaction out of the oxidizing gas passage.  The change in form or shape, without
      any new or unexpected results, is an obvious engineering design. See In re Dailey,
      149 USPQ 47 (CCPA 1976) (see MPEP \xA7 2144.04).\\n Kai et al. is silent regarding
      an asymmetrical blade cooperative with the shaft within the fluid passage, wherein
      the asymmetrical blade comprises a first blade section and a second blade section
      divided by the shaft, and wherein the first blade section has a surface area
      substantially less than the surface area of the second blade section such that
      a fluid pressure in the asymmetrical fluid passage imparts a torque on the shaft
      through the asymmetrical blade.  However, Rim et al. teaches an exhaust heat
      recovery system for a combustion engine in a motor vehicle wherein the exhaust
      valve that comprises an asymmetrical blade (butterfly plate 50) eliminates bearing/bushing
      leakage under backpressure (col. 2, lines 9-13).  Rim teaches an asymmetrical
      blade cooperative with the shaft (54) within the fluid passage (col. 3, lines
      38-39), wherein the asymmetrical blade comprises a first blade section (top
      portion of butterfly plate 50) and a second blade section (bottom portion of
      butterfly plate 50) divided by the shaft, and wherein the first blade section
      has a surface area substantially less than the surface area of the second blade
      section (Fig. 5) and is fully capable of the fluid pressure in the asymmetrical
      fluid passage imparts a torque on the shaft through the asymmetrical blade.
      \ Accordingly, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art
      at the time of the invention to modify the teachings of Kai et al. by the teachings
      of Rim to use an asymmetrical blade that is divided into a first blade section
      and a second blade section in an effort to provide better exhaust sealing performance
      under backpressure for an exhaust recover system at a reduced manufacturing
      cost.  \\nModified Kai et al. is silent regarding a biasing device operatively
      connected to the asymmetrical blade, wherein the asymmetrical blade is rotatable
      between a closed  position and an open position such that: when in the closed
      position, the biasing device provides a closing torque which exceeds the torque
      imparted on the shaft from the pressurized fluid in the asymmetrical fluid passage
      to urge the asymmetrical blade to the closed position, and when in the open
      position, the pressurized fluid provides an opening torque substantially greater
      than the closing torque such that the asymmetrical blade is urged to the open
      position. \\nHowever, Fauni teaches a petrol driven internal combustion engine
      provided with a butterfly valve (para. [0002]).  Fauni also teaches that it
      is known in the art to have a biasing device (combination of torsion spiral
      return spring and a torsion spiral opposing spring) operatively connected to
      the asymmetrical blade, wherein the asymmetrical blade is rotatable between
      a closed position and an open position such that (para. [0003]):\\nwhen in the
      closed position, the biasing device provides a closing torque which exceeds
      the torque imparted on the shaft from the pressurized fluid in the asymmetrical
      fluid passage to urge the asymmetrical blade to the closed position (para. [0003];
      torque imparted on the asymmetrical blade via the shaft must be greater than
      the torque imparted on the shaft from the pressurized fluid in order to move
      the blade to the closing position), and \\nwhen in the open position, the pressurized
      fluid provides an opening torque substantially greater than the closing torque
      such that the asymmetrical blade is urged to the open position (para. [0003];
      torque imparted on the asymmetrical blade via the  shaft must be less than the
      torque imparted on the shaft from the pressurized fluid in order to move the
      blade to the opening position). \\nThe Examiner notes that \u201Ca fluid pressure
      in the asymmetrical fluid passage imparts a torque on the shaft through the
      asymmetrical blade\u201D is a function of the apparatus (see MPEP 2114) which
      occurs naturally in the structurally indistinguishable apparatus of the prior
      art.\\nRegarding claim 2, Kai et al. teaches a valve wherein the asymmetrical
      fluid passage is an oxidant passage in a fuel cell system (col. 4, lines 47-51).
      \ Kai et al. is silent regarding the valve being used in a vehicle.  However,
      Rim teaches that its butterfly valve is used in a vehicle exhaust system (col.
      2, lines 9-11).  Accordingly, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary
      skill in the art at the time of the invention to modify the teachings of Kai
      et al. by the teachings of Rim et al. as it is known in the art to use fuel
      cell systems in vehicles and butterfly valves in vehicle exhaust systems.  \\nRegarding
      claim 3,  Kai et al. teaches a valve wherein the asymmetrical fluid passage
      is an oxidant passage in a fuel cell system (col. 4, lines 47-51).  Kai et al.
      is silent regarding the asymmetrical fluid passage is an exhaust passage in
      a fuel cell system exhaust stream in a vehicle.  However, Rim teaches that its
      butterfly valve is used in a vehicle exhaust system (col. 2, lines 9-11).  Accordingly,
      it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of
      the invention to modify the teachings of Kai et al. by the teachings of Rim
      et al. as it is known in the art to use fuel cell systems in vehicles and butterfly
      valves in vehicle exhaust streams.  \\nRegarding claim 4, Kai et al. is silent
      regarding a valve wherein the asymmetrical fluid passage comprises a substantially
      ovoid shape, and the asymmetrical blade comprises a substantially ovoid shape
      that is substantially similar in size and shape to the asymmetrical fluid passage
      to define a substantially fluid tight connection therebetween.  However, absent
      a lack of criticality and unexpected results, it would have been obvious to
      one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to modify the
      teachings of Kai et al. such that the asymmetrical fluid passage comprises a
      substantially ovoid shape and the asymmetrical blade comprises a substantially
      ovoid shape as different shaped valve seats and different shaped blades are
      needed to accommodate different shaped fluid passages.  \\nRegarding claim 5,
      modified Kai et al. teaches a valve wherein the asymmetrical blade is cooperative
      with the shaft at substantially the greatest width of the asymmetrical blade
      (Rim, Fig. 5). \\nRegarding claim 6, modified Kai et al. teaches that the valve
      wherein the surface area of the first blade section is greater than the surface
      area of the second blade section (Rim, Fig. 5).  Modified Kai et al. is silent
      regarding a valve wherein the surface area of the first blade section is from
      about 60% to 110% greater than the surface area of the second blade section.
      \ However, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at
      the time of the invention to further modify the teachings of modified Kai et
      al. in the aforementioned manner if doing so provides better exhaust sealing
      performance under backpressure for an exhaust recover system at a reduced manufacturing
      cost. \u201C[W]here the general conditions of a claim are disclosed in the prior
      \ art, it is not inventive to discover the optimum or workable ranges by routine
      experimentation.\u201D See In re Aller, 220 F.2d 454, 456, 105 USPQ 233, 235
      (CCPA 1955). The discovery of an optimum value of a known result effective variable,
      without producing any new or unexpected results, is within the ambit of a person
      of ordinary skill in the art. See In re Boesch, 205 USPQ 215 (CCPA 1980) (see
      MPEP \xA7 2144.05, II.).\\nRegarding claim 9, modified Kai et al. teaches a
      valve wherein the biasing device comprises a spring (Fauni, para. [0003]). \\nRegarding
      claim 10, Kai et al. is silent regarding a valve wherein the valve further comprises
      an actuator operatively connected to the shaft.  However, Rim teaches a valve
      wherein the valve further comprises an actuator operatively connected to the
      shaft (Rim, col. 4, lines 8-10 and 35-39).  Accordingly, it would have been
      obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to
      modify the teachings of Kai et al. by the teachings of Rim in an effort to provide
      better exhaust sealing performance under backpressure for an exhaust recover
      system at a reduced manufacturing cost.  \\nClaim 7 is rejected under pre-AIA
      \ 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Kai et al. in view of Rim (US
      6,739,579) in view of Applicant\u2019s Admitted Prior Art (hereinafter \u2018AAPA\u2019)
      in view of Fauni (PG Pub. US 2005/0263731) as applied to claim 1 above, and
      further in view of Aigami (US Patent 6,155,298).\\nRegarding claim 7, modified
      Kai et al. is silent regarding a valve wherein the asymmetrical blade is provided
      within the asymmetrical fluid passage such that the asymmetrical blade forms
      a seat angle of from about 0\xB0 to about 60\xB0.  However, Aigami number='10'teaches
      it is known in the art for a valve to have a valve seat that has an angle of
      inclination between 30 degrees to 60 degrees relative to the central axis of
      the valve body (claims 1 and 6).  Accordingly, it would have been obvious to
      one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to further modify
      the teachings of modified Kai et al. by the teachings of Aigami such that the
      asymmetrical blade forms a seat angle of from about 0\xB0 to about 60\xB0 to
      better control the direction of fluid through the asymmetrical fluid passage.
      \ \\nClaim 8 is rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable
      over Kai et al. in view of Rim (US 6,739,579) in view of Applicant\u2019s Admitted
      Prior Art (hereinafter \u2018AAPA\u2019) in view of Fauni (PG Pub. US 2005/0263731)
      as applied to claim 1 above, and further in view of Hueppchen et al. (PG Pub.
      US 2006/0180541).\\nRegarding claim 8, modified Kai et al. teaches a valve wherein
      the asymmetrical blade further comprises a metal ring seal provided on an outer
      edge thereof (Rim, Fig. 5, ref. no. 60; col. 3, lines 56-58).  Modified Kai
      et al. is silent regarding a valve wherein the seal is elastomeric.  However,
      Hueppchen et al. teaches that it is known in the art to seal a valve seat through
      the use of a thin-walled metal, plastic or elastomer plate (para. [0022]).  Accordingly,
      it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of
      the invention to further modify the teachings of modified Kai et al. by the
      teachings of Hueppchen et al. in order to create a fluid tight connection between
      the asymmetrical blade and the asymmetrical passage as substituting a plastic
      or an elastomer plate for a thin-walled metal in a valve is known in the art.
      \ The simple substitution of one known element for another is likely to be obvious
      when predictable number='11'results are achieved. See KSR International Co.
      v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. __,__, 82 USPQ2d 1385, 1395 \u2013 97 (2007) (see
      MPEP \xA7 2143, B.).\\nClaim 11 is rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a)
      as being unpatentable over Kai et al. in view of Rim (US 6,739,579) in view
      of Applicant\u2019s Admitted Prior Art (hereinafter \u2018AAPA\u2019) in view
      of Fauni (PG Pub. US 2005/0263731) as applied to claim 1 above, and further
      in view of Schmid et al. (PG Pub. US 2005/01888693).\\nRegarding claim 11, modified
      Kai et al. is silent regarding a valve wherein the valve is at least one of
      passive and semi-passive.  However, Schmid et al. teaches that it is known in
      the art that butterfly valves in combustion engines are passive valves.  Accordingly,
      it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of
      the invention to modify the teachings of modified Kai et al. by the teachings
      of Schmid et al. such that the backpressure control valve is a passive valve
      in order to reduce the number of moving parts in the valve that are subject
      to mechanical failure.   \\nClaims 12 and 13 are rejected under pre-AIA  35
      U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Kai et al. (US Patent 6,777,124) in
      view of Rim (US 6,739,579) in view of Applicant\u2019s Admitted Prior Art (hereinafter
      \u2018AAPA\u2019) and further in view of Fauni (PG Pub. US 2005/0263731).\\nRegarding
      claim 12, Kai et al. teaches a fuel cell system (Abstract) comprising: \\na
      fuel cell comprising an anode and a cathode in electrolytic communication with
      an electrolyte membrane, wherein the anode and the cathode are provided on opposing
      sides of the electrolyte membrane (col. 1, lines 11-18);\\nnumber='12'a body
      that defines an oxidant passage in fluid communication with the cathode (col.
      1, lines 22-24); \\na backpressure control valve (butterfly valve; Fig. 1, ref.
      no. 11) cooperative with the body (pipe - ref. no. 12; Abstract; Figs. 2), wherein
      the valve comprises:\\na shaft (14) cooperative with the body such that the
      shaft extends across the oxidant passage (col. 4, lines 56-61).  \\nKai et al.
      is silent regarding the oxidant passage being asymmetrical.  However, absent
      a lack of criticality and unexpected results, it would have been obvious to
      one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to modify the
      body (pipe member) of Kai et al. such that the body defines an asymmetrical
      oxidant passage if such a shape helps with moving the water that is produced
      during the electrochemical reaction out of the oxidizing gas passage.  The change
      in form or shape, without any new or unexpected results, is an obvious engineering
      design. See In re Dailey, 149 USPQ 47 (CCPA 1976) (see MPEP \xA7 2144.04).\\nKai
      et al. is silent regarding an asymmetrical blade cooperative with the shaft
      within the oxidant passage, wherein the asymmetrical blade comprises a first
      blade section and a second blade section divided by the shaft, and wherein the
      first blade section has a surface area substantially less than the surface area
      of the second blade section such that a fluid pressure in the asymmetrical oxidant
      passage imparts a torque on the shaft through the asymmetrical blade.  However,
      Rim et al. teaches an asymmetrical blade (butterfly plate 50) cooperative with
      the shaft (54) within the fluid passage (col. 3, lines 38-39), wherein the asymmetrical
      blade comprises a first blade number='13'section (top portion of butterfly plate
      50) and a second blade section (bottom portion of butterfly plate 50) divided
      by the shaft, and wherein the first blade section has a surface area substantially
      less than the surface area of the second blade section (Fig. 5) and is fully
      capable of the fluid pressure in the asymmetrical fluid passage imparts a torque
      on the shaft through the asymmetrical blade.   Accordingly, it would have been
      obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to
      modify the teachings of Kai et al. by the teachings of Rim to use an asymmetrical
      blade that is divided into a first blade section and a second blade section
      in an effort to provide better exhaust sealing performance under backpressure
      for an exhaust recover system at a reduced manufacturing cost.  \\nModified
      Kai et al. is silent regarding a biasing device operatively connected to the
      asymmetrical blade, wherein the asymmetrical blade is rotatable between a closed
      position and an open position such that: when in the closed position, the biasing
      device provides a closing torque which exceeds the torque imparted on the shaft
      from the pressurized fluid in the asymmetrical oxidant passage to urge the asymmetrical
      blade to the closed position, and when in the open position, the pressurized
      fluid provides an opening torque substantially greater than the closing torque
      such that the asymmetrical blade is urged to the open position. \\nHowever,
      Fauni teaches a petrol driven internal combustion engine provided with a butterfly
      valve (para. [0002]).  Fauni also teaches that it is known in the art to have
      a biasing device (combination of torsion spiral return spring and a torsion
      spiral opposing spring) operatively connected to the asymmetrical blade, wherein
      the asymmetrical number='14'blade is rotatable between a closed position and
      an open position such that (para. [0003]):\\nwhen in the closed position, the
      biasing device provides a closing torque which exceeds the torque imparted on
      the shaft from the pressurized fluid in the asymmetrical oxidant passage to
      urge the asymmetrical blade to the closed position (para. [0003]; torque imparted
      on the asymmetrical blade via the shaft must be greater than the torque imparted
      on the shaft from the pressurized fluid in order to move the blade to the closing
      position), and \\nwhen in the open position, the pressurized fluid provides
      an opening torque substantially greater than the closing torque such that the
      asymmetrical blade is urged to the open position (para. [0003]; torque imparted
      on the asymmetrical blade via the shaft must be less than the torque imparted
      on the shaft from the pressurized fluid in order to move the blade to the opening
      position). \\nRegarding claim 13, Kai et al. is silent regarding a valve wherein
      the valve further comprises an actuator operatively connected to the shaft.
      \ However, Rim teaches a valve wherein the valve further comprises an actuator
      operatively connected to the shaft (Rim, col. 4, lines 8-10 and 35-39).  Accordingly,
      it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of
      the invention to modify the teachings of Kai et al. by the teachings of Rim
      in an effort to provide better exhaust sealing performance under backpressure
      for an exhaust recover system at a reduced manufacturing cost.  \\nnumber='15'Conclusion\\nAny

      Rejections - 35 USC \xA7 112\\nThe following is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 112(b):\\n(b)
      \ CONCLUSION.\u2014The specification shall conclude with one or more claims
      particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the
      inventor or a joint inventor regards as the invention.\\n\\n\\nThe following
      is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 112 (pre-AIA ), second paragraph:\\nThe specification
      shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly
      claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention.\\n\\n\\nClaims
      5 and 10-19 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 112(b) or 35 U.S.C. 112 (pre-AIA ),
      second paragraph, as being indefinite for failing to particularly point out
      and distinctly claim the subject matter which the inventor or a joint inventor
      (or for applications subject to pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 112, the applicant), regards
      as the invention.\\nIn regard to claims 5 and 10, these claims are apparatus
      claims directed to \u201Can electrical connector\u201D, claims 5 and 10 are
      claiming that the electrical connector is connected to a cable (which is not
      part of the electrical connector) and then further claiming structural limitations
      of the cable which are not afforded patentable weight of \u201Cthe electric
      connector\u201D.  It is unclear what exactly the bounds of this claim are, or
      what exactly Applicant is intending the bounds of this claim.  These claims
      are clearly directed to the structure of the cable, but the claim set is directed
      to \u201Can electrical connector\u201D that is connected to the cable, meaning
      that the cable is an external piece that communicates with the electrical connector
      as claimed.  If Applicant wants the limitations of the cable afforded patentable
      weight, the claim should be \u201Ca system comprising: an electrical connector
      comprising: \u2026.; wherein the electrical connector is connected to a cable;
      \ the cable comprising: \u2026\\nClaims 11-19, further are describing details
      of external structures (apparatus) even to the cable, such as \u2018a female
      data receiver/male data prong coupling to the inner conduit\u2019 and further
      describing the receptor, but all of these are outside the bounds of the claim
      of \u201Can electrical connector\u201D.  Claims 11-12, are out of the boundary
      of the \u201Celectrical connector\u2019 claims as they are now claiming what
      the cable is configured to do\u201D.  Further, as to claims 13-16, it is not
      clear the difference between an apparatus associated with the receptor and an
      apparatus associated with the connector.  The receptor would be associated with
      the connector as they are all connected and any item connecting with data/electricity
      could be called a receptor, so it appears these would be the same elements.
      \ Because of this ambiguity between the difference of \u2018apparatus associated
      with receptor/connector\u2019.  Claims 17 and 18 appear to be similar as well.
      \ Claim 19, is further describing the apparatus that may be connected to the
      connector.\\n\\nDouble Patenting\\nApplicant is advised that should claim 13
      be found allowable, claims 14-16 will be objected to under 37 CFR 1.75 as being
      a substantial duplicate thereof. When two claims in an application are duplicates
      or else are so close in content that they both cover the same thing, despite
      a slight difference in wording, it is proper after allowing one claim to object
      to the other as being a substantial duplicate of the allowed claim. See MPEP
      \xA7 608.01(m).  See above description in the 35 USC 112 rejection.\\n\\nApplicant

      on a judicially created doctrine grounded in public policy (a policy reflected
      in the statute) so as to prevent the unjustified or improper timewise extension
      of the \u201Cright to exclude\u201D granted by a patent and to prevent possible
      harassment by multiple assignees. A nonstatutory double patenting rejection
      is appropriate where the conflicting claims are not identical, but at least
      one examined application claim is not patentably distinct from the reference
      claim(s) because the examined application claim is either anticipated by, or
      would have been obvious over, the reference claim(s). See, e.g., In re Berg,

      37 CFR 1.321(c) or 1.321(d) may be used to overcome an actual or provisional
      rejection based on nonstatutory double patenting provided the reference application
      or patent either is shown to be commonly owned with the examined application,
      or claims an invention made as a result of activities undertaken within the
      scope of a joint research agreement. See MPEP \xA7 717.02 for applications subject

      the claims in the present application and that of patent 11,226,378 (application
      number 16/879809) were part of a restriction requirement in application 15/730859
      (now patent number 10,698,039), the claims in 11,226,378 were amended and are
      not consonant with the restriction requirement made back in the original application
      of 15/730859 (see MPEP 801.01 B) further the present application includes many
      new claims that were not part of the original restriction requirement.\\nClaims
      1-20 are rejected on the ground of nonstatutory double patenting as being unpatentable
      over claims 1-16 of U.S. Patent No. 11,226,378.  Although the claims at issue
      are not identical, they are not patentably distinct from each other because:\\nIn
      regard to claims 1 and 6, an electrical connector/male prong set (col 6 line
      34 prong is an elongated piece equivalent to male), comprising: an engagement
      set (col 6 line 34, prong); a plunger physically coupled to the engagement set
      (col 6 lines 35-36); an energy storage device physically coupled to the plunger
      (col 6 lines 37-38, spring is a more specific energy storage device); a contact
      physically coupled to the energy storage device (col 6 lines 39-40); and a current
      receiver connector (col 6 lines 42-43; where the energy storage device is set
      at a force level such that when at rest the contact does not touch the current
      receiver connector (col 6 line 44-46), where when the engagement set engages
      with a receptor, the engagement set experiences a pressure (col 6 lines 47-48),
      where when the pressure meets a threshold, the pressure causes the plunger to
      move the energy storage device to overcome the force level such that the contact
      touches the current receiver connector (col 6 line 50-54, while not the same
      language very similar), and where when the contact touches the current source
      connector, the engagement set is energized (col 6 line 55-57).\\nIn regard to

      7 of patent 11,226,378 (noting that being disconnected means that the engagement
      set is de-energized).\\nIn regard to claims 5 and 10, see claim 1 of patent

      \ \\nThe following is a quotation of the appropriate paragraphs of 35 U.S.C.
      102 that form the basis for the rejections under this section made in this Office
      action:\\nA person shall be entitled to a patent unless \u2013\\n\\n(a)(1) the
      claimed invention was patented, described in a printed publication, or in public
      use, on sale, or otherwise available to the public before the effective filing
      date of the claimed invention.\\n\\n\\nClaims 1, 2, 4-7, 9-10, and 20 are rejected
      under 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1) as being anticipated by Sheldon et al. (7513782).\\nIn
      regard to claims 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, and 20, Sheldon et al. discloses \\n[claims
      1, 2, 6, and 20] a male prong set comprising one or more prongs (figures 4 and
      5 are going to be referred to the most, but figure 2 shows the best picture
      of the prongs 12, 13); \\n[claims 1, 6, and 20] a plunger physically coupled
      to the male prong set (figures 4 and 5, arm 28, col 4 lines 14-16) ; \\n[claims
      1, 6, and 20] an energy storage device physically coupled to the plunger (spring
      31 \u2013 col 4 lines 14-16); \\n[claims 1, 6, and 20] a contact physically
      coupled to the energy storage device (contact 26 see col 4 lines 14-17); and\\n[claims
      1, 6, and 20] a current receiver connector (hot wire 22, col 4 lines 15-17);\\n[claims
      1, 6, and 20] where the energy storage device is set at a force level such that
      when at rest the contact does not touch the current receiver connector (see
      figure 5, in the instance the ground prong is not properly connected, the force
      level is low and thus energy storage device does not contact to the contact
      and current receiver \u2013 see figure 5 and then figure 4 shows when connected,
      col 4 lines 3-39),\\n[claims 1, 6, and 20] where when the male prong set engages
      with a receptor, the male prong set experiences a pressure (when the ground
      prong is properly installed, the prong set experiences a pressure, see also
      claim 5),\\n[claims 1, 6, and 20] where when the pressure meets a threshold,
      the pressure causes the plunger to move the energy storage device to overcome
      the force level such that the contact touches the current receiver connector
      (the pressure will cause the spring to engage, see claim 5 and col 4 lines 9-27),\\n[claims
      1, 6, and 20] where when the contact touches the current source connector, the
      male prong set is energized (shown in figure 4, current is able to run through
      the hot line and electrify the appliance when the spring is in the proper position),\\n[claims
      2, 7, and 20] where energizing of the current receiver connector comprises transferring
      an electrical current by way of the male prong set (this is a normal three pong
      plug that upon connection to a source and the spring is at a pressure will have
      electric current run through the hot line \u2013 col 1 lines 12-16),\\n[claims
      2, 7, and 20] where a provider of the electrical current is a female receiver
      configured to receive the male prong set (this limitation is not providing a
      structural limitation to the \u201Celectrical connector\u201D as claimed so
      it is a functional limitation, but the electrical connector as claimed is a
      male plug as seen in figure 2, which would be configured to connect to a female
      outlet \u2013 for example a wall outlet),\\n[claims 4, 9, and 20] where when
      the pressure no longer meets the threshold, the pressure causes the plunger
      to no longer move the energy storage device to overcome the force level such
      that the contact no longer touch the current receiver connector (if the pressure
      comes off, the spring is released and the two male prong set becomes inoperable
      \u2013 see col 4 line 28-39), and\\n[claims 4, 9, and 20] where when the contact
      no longer touches the current source connector, the male prong set is deenergized
      (as the spring is released, the contact 26 and the source connector 22 come
      apart as seen in figure 5 and the two male prong set becomes inoperable \u2013
      see col 4 line 28-39).\\nClaims 5 and 10, Sheldon et al. discloses wherein the
      electrical connector of claim 1 is configured to be coupled to a cable (see
      figures 1-5 of Sheldon, the prongs allow it to be coupled to a cable). ***Noting
      that these claims sets (in claims 1-20) are apparatus claims directed to \u201Can
      electrical connector\u201D, claims 5 and 10 are claiming that the electrical
      connector is connected to a cable (which is not part of the electrical connector)
      and then further claiming structural limitations of the cable which are not
      afforded patentable weight of \u201Cthe electric connector\u201D \u2013 if Applicant
      wants the limitations of the cable afforded patentable weight, the claim should
      be \u201Ca system comprising: an electrical connector comprising: \u2026.; wherein
      the electrical connector is connected to a cable;  the cable comprising: \u2026.***

      102 and 103) is incorrect, any correction of the statutory basis for the rejection
      will not be considered a new ground of rejection if the prior art relied upon,
      and the rationale supporting the rejection, would be the same under either status.
      \ \\nThe following is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 103 which forms the basis for
      all obviousness rejections set forth in this Office action:\\nA patent for a
      claimed invention may not be obtained, notwithstanding that the claimed invention
      is not identically disclosed as set forth in section 102, if the differences
      between the claimed invention and the prior art are such that the claimed invention
      as a whole would have been obvious before the effective filing date of the claimed
      invention to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which the claimed
      invention pertains. Patentability shall not be negated by the manner in which
      the invention was made.\\n\\nClaims 5 and 10-19 are rejected under 35 U.S.C.
      103 as being unpatentable over Sheldon et al. (7513782) in view of Kim et al.
      (US Publication 2006/0065429).***Claims 5 and 10 are twice rejected while these
      claim is rejected as if the cable could have a connection, while showing that
      this cable exists in the prior art***\\nIn regard to claims 5 and 10, Sheldon
      et al. lacks specifically the electric connector of claim 1, coupled to a cable,
      the cable comprising: an outer conduit upon which an electrical current runs
      through the engagement set to energize the engagement set; and an inner conduit
      to transmit a data, where the outer conduit surrounds the outer conduit.  ***Note
      this claim is rejected as best understood***\\nKim et al. discloses a cable
      (abstract), comprising: an inner conduit configured to transfer a data to an
      apparatus (paragraph 41, the fiber optic assembly 402 is the inner conduit conductor);
      and an outer conduit configured to transfer an electrical current to the apparatus
      and connected to the prongs, where the outer conduit encompasses the inner conduit
      (the outer conductors 404 which together surround the outer conductor and pass
      a current to power the electrical device \u2014 paragraph 41).\\nIt would be
      known that Sheldon et al. having a normal plug is able to be attached to a cable
      (such as an extension cord, cable converter, etc), but it would be further obvious
      for Sheldon et al. to be able to attach to a cable having an inner and outer
      conduit, such that the outer conduit will transfer electricity through the prongs
      as taught by Kim et al. in order to include connection to a multifunction cable
      in increase the functionality of the connector of Sheldon et al., so that the
      spring will not be connected in any dangerous condition.\\nIn regard to claims
      11-19 rejected as best understood, Sheldon et al. includes connections connected
      to the electrical connector with is configured to be connected to the cable
      as well as further connections connected to the connector \u2013 Sheldon et
      al. discloses prongs which are able to be connected to outlets, surge protectors,
      extension cords, etc and would also be configured to be part of the cord to
      appliances (Sheldon et al. - see col 1 lines 12-16), where as the cable of Kim
      et al. is able to provide a large amount of power while reducing undesirable
      electrical effects while connected (Kim et al. - see paragraph 8).\\n\\nAllowable
      Subject Matter\\nClaims 3 and 7 are objected to as being dependent upon a rejected
      base claim, but would be allowable if rewritten in independent form including
      all of the limitations of the base claim and any intervening claims.\\nIn regard
      to claims 3 and 7, the prior art does not teach or render obvious where the
      prong set comprising a first prong and a second prong, where the plunger comprises
      a first plunger coupled to the first prong and a second plunger coupled to the
      second prong, where the energy storage device comprises a first energy storage
      device coupled to the first plunger and a second energy storage device coupled
      to the second plunger, where the contact comprises a first contact coupled to
      the first plunger and a second contact coupled to the second plunger, where

      \       \"bodyText\":[\"DETAILED ACTION\\nElection/Restrictions\\nRestriction
      to one of the following inventions is required under 35 U.S.C. 121:\\nI.  \\tClaims
      1-9, drawn to a process for determining the shell phenotype of a palm plant
      or seed by providing the plant or seed and determining from the sample the genotype
      of at least one polymorphic marker in a region corresponding to SEQ ID NO:8128,
      classified, for example, in CPC A01H 1/04.\\nII. \\tClaims 10-15, drawn to a
      product kit comprising an oligonucleotide primer or probe at least 18 nucleotides
      of SEQ ID NO:8128, classified, for example, in CPC C12Q 1/6895.\\nIII. \\tClaims
      16-20, drawn to a product plant comprising a heterologous expression cassette
      comprising a promoter linked to a polynucleotide that when expressed reduces
      expression of a SHELL polypeptide, classified, for example, in CPC C12N 15/8261.\\nThe
      inventions are distinct, each from the other because of the following reasons:
      \ \\nInventions I and II are related as product and process of use.  The inventions
      can be shown to be distinct if either or both of the following can be shown:
      (1) the process for using the product as claimed can be practiced with another
      materially different product or (2) the product as claimed can be used in a
      materially different process of using that product. See MPEP \xA7 806.05(h).
      \ In the instant case the process of invention I can be practiced using a materially
      different product, such as a primer or probe that comprises less than 18 nucleotides
      of SEQ ID NO:8218 and the oligonucleotides of invention II can be used in any
      number of processes that are materially different from  the process of invention
      I, such as cloning gene sequences from the SEQ ID NO:8218 interval.\\nInventions
      I and III are related as product and process of use.  The inventions can be
      shown to be distinct if either or both of the following can be shown: (1) the
      process for using the product as claimed can be practiced with another materially
      different product or (2) the product as claimed can be used in a materially
      different process of using that product. See MPEP \xA7 806.05(h).  In the instant
      case the process of invention I can be practiced using a materially different
      product, such as a plant that does not comprise any heterologous expression
      cassette and the plant of invention III can be used in any number of processes
      that are materially different from the process of invention I, such as growing
      the plant to produce fruits.\\nInventions II and III are directed to related
      products. The related inventions are distinct if: (1) the inventions as claimed
      are either not capable of use together or can have a materially different design,
      mode of operation, function, or effect; (2) the inventions do not overlap in
      scope, i.e., are mutually exclusive; and (3) the inventions as claimed are not
      obvious variants.  See MPEP \xA7 806.05(j). In the instant case, the inventions
      as claimed have materially different design because the oligonucleotides of
      invention II encompass innumerable oligonucleotide embodiments (oligonucleotides
      with various heterologous chemical tags, for example) that would not appear
      in the plant embodiments of invention III.  Furthermore, the inventions as claimed
      do not encompass overlapping subject matter and there is nothing of record to
      show them to be obvious variants.\\n\\n.\\n\\nRestriction for examination purposes
      as indicated is proper because all these inventions listed in this action are
      independent or distinct for the reasons given above and there would be a serious
      search and/or examination burden if restriction were not required because at
      least the following reason(s) apply:\\n(a) The inventions have acquired a separate
      status in the art in view of their different classification;\\n(b) The inventions
      have acquired a separate status in the art due to their recognized divergent
      subject matter;\\n(c) The inventions require a different field of search (for
      example, searching different classes/subclasses or electronic resources, or
      employing different search queries); \\n(d) The prior art applicable to one
      invention would not likely be applicable to another invention; \\n(e) The inventions
      are likely to raise different non-prior art issues under 35 U.S.C. 101 and/or
      35 U.S.C. 112, first paragraph. \\nApplicant is advised that the reply to this
      requirement to be complete must include (i) an election of an invention to be
      examined even though the requirement may be traversed (37 CFR 1.143) and (ii)
      identification of the claims encompassing the elected invention. \\nThe election
      of an invention may be made with or without traverse. To reserve a right to
      petition, the election must be made with traverse. If the reply does not distinctly
      and specifically point out supposed errors in the restriction requirement, the
      election  shall be treated as an election without traverse. Traversal must be
      presented at the time of election in order to be considered timely. Failure
      to timely traverse the requirement will result in the loss of right to petition
      under 37 CFR 1.144. If claims are added after the election, applicant must indicate
      which of these claims are readable upon the elected invention.\\nShould applicant
      traverse on the ground that the inventions are not patentably distinct, applicant
      should submit evidence or identify such evidence now of record showing the inventions
      to be obvious variants or clearly admit on the record that this is the case.
      In either instance, if the examiner finds one of the inventions unpatentable
      over the prior art, the evidence or admission may be used in a rejection under
      35 U.S.C. 103(a) of the other invention.\\nUpon the allowance of a generic claim,
      applicant will be entitled to consideration of claims to additional species
      which depend from or otherwise require all the limitations of an allowable generic
      claim as provided by 37 CFR 1.141. Applicant is reminded that upon the cancellation
      of claims to a non-elected invention, the inventorship must be corrected in
      compliance with  37 CFR 1.48(a) if one or more of the currently named inventors
      is no longer an inventor of at least one claim remaining in the application.
      A request to correct inventorship under 37 CFR 1.48(a) must be accompanied by
      an application data sheet in accordance with 37 CFR 1.76 that identifies each
      inventor by his or her legal name and by the processing fee required under 37
      CFR 1.17(i).\\nThe examiner has required restriction between product or apparatus
      claims and process claims. Where applicant elects claims directed to the product/apparatus,
      and all product/apparatus claims are subsequently found allowable, withdrawn
      process claims  that include all the limitations of the allowable product/apparatus
      claims should be considered for rejoinder. All claims directed to a nonelected
      process invention must include all the limitations of an allowable product/apparatus
      claim for that process invention to be rejoined. \\nIn the event of rejoinder,
      the requirement for restriction between the product/apparatus claims and the
      rejoined process claims will be withdrawn, and the rejoined process claims will
      be fully examined for patentability in accordance with 37 CFR 1.104. Thus, to
      be allowable, the rejoined claims must meet all criteria for patentability including
      the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 101, 102, 103 and 112. Until all claims to the
      elected product/apparatus are found allowable, an otherwise proper restriction
      requirement between product/apparatus claims and process claims may be maintained.
      Withdrawn process claims that are not commensurate in scope with an allowable
      product/apparatus claim will not be rejoined. See MPEP \xA7 821.04. Additionally,
      in order for rejoinder to occur, applicant is advised that the process claims
      should be amended during prosecution to require the limitations of the product/apparatus
      claims. Failure to do so may result in no rejoinder. Further, note that the
      prohibition against double patenting rejections of 35 U.S.C. 121 does not apply
      where the restriction requirement is withdrawn by the examiner before the patent

      making the solder out of different materials, the melting point of the second
      conductive bonding member can be higher than the melting point of the first
      conductive bonding member, thereby preventing the functional contactor from
      coming apart when it is adhered to the substrate.\\nRegarding claim 14, Lee
      teaches the functional contactor of claim 12, wherein the functional element
      has at least one selected from the group consisting of an electric shock prevention
      function for blocking a leakage current of an external power source input from
      a ground of a substrate of an electronic device, a communication signal bypass
      function for passing a communication signal input from a conductive case, and
      an ESD protection function for passing static electricity without dielectric
      breakdown when the static electricity is input from the conductive case (refer
      to [0005]). \\nRegarding claim 15, Lee teaches the functional contactor of claim
      12, wherein the conductive elastic part is brought in line contact or point
      contact with the conductor (implicit)([0059]) to decrease galvanic corrosion
      (inherent)(line contact and point contact inherently decrease galvanic corrosion).\\n
      Claim 4 is/are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable over Lee as
      applied to claim 3 above, and further in view of Janssen et al. U.S. Patent
      Application 2014/0160704 (hereinafter \u201CJanssen\u201D).\\nRegarding claim
      4, Lee teaches the functional contactor of claim 3, wherein the conductive elastic
      part is fastened by means of the conductive adhesive layer or through the solder
      (refer to [0071]), however Lee does not teach wherein the functional element
      has a groove disposed at an upper side, wherein the second electrode is formed
      on a bottom surface of the groove, and wherein the conductive elastic part is
      fastened inside the groove by means of the conductive adhesive layer or through
      the solder. However, Janssen teaches wherein the functional element has a groove
      (i.e. recess 160)(fig.1) disposed at an upper side (implicit), wherein the second
      electrode (i.e. second electrode 132)(fig.1) is formed on a bottom surface of
      the groove (implicit), and wherein the conductive elastic part is fastened inside
      the groove (implicit)(refer to fig.1). It would have been obvious to a person
      of ordinary skill in the art before the effective filing date of the claimed
      invention to modify the contactor of Lee to include the groove of Janssen to
      provide the advantage of making the contactor less susceptible to breakage and
      allowing for a smaller device by allowing the circuit board to come closer to
      the conductor.\\n Claim 5 is/are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable
      over Lee as applied to claim 1 above, and further in view of Ling et al. U.S.
      Patent No. 4,811,164 (hereinafter \u201CLing\u201D).\\nRegarding claim 5, Lee
      teaches the functional contactor of claim 1, however Lee does not teach wherein
      the dielectric is made of a ceramic material, and wherein the ceramic material
      is a metal oxide compound comprising one or more selected from the group consisting
      of among Er203, Dy2O3, HO2O3, V205, CoO, MoO3, SnO2, BaTiO3, and Nd203, wherein
      the ceramic material is a fired ceramic or a ferrite, or contains any one of
      a ZnO-based varistor material, a Pr-based material, and a Bi-based material,
      however Ling teaches wherein the dielectric is made of a ceramic material (refer
      to claim 1), and wherein the ceramic material is a metal oxide compound comprising
      one or more selected from the group consisting of among Er203, Dy2O3, HO2O3,
      V205, CoO, MoO3, SnO2, BaTiO3, and Nd203 (refer to claim 8), wherein the ceramic
      material is a fired ceramic or a ferrite, or contains any one of a ZnO-based
      varistor material, a Pr-based material, and a Bi-based material (refer to claims
      1, 2, and 7). It would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the
      art before the effective filing date of the claimed invention to modify the
      contactor of Lee to include the ceramics of Ling to provide the advantage of
      having a relatively high capacitance with a relatively small size.\\n\"],\n

      rejections set forth in this Office action:\\nA patent for a claimed invention

      have been obvious before the effective filing date of the claimed invention

      skill in the pertinent art.\\n4. Considering objective evidence present in the
      application indicating obviousness or nonobviousness.\\nThis application currently
      names joint inventors. In considering patentability of the claims the examiner
      presumes that the subject matter of the various claims was commonly owned as
      of the effective filing date of the claimed invention(s) absent any evidence
      to the contrary.  Applicant is advised of the obligation under 37 CFR 1.56 to
      point out the inventor and effective filing dates of each claim that was not
      commonly owned as of the effective filing date of the later invention in order
      for the examiner to consider the applicability of 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(C) for

      claim 2, Kim teaches the functional contactor of claim 1, however Kim does not
      teach wherein the functional element has a withstand voltage higher than a rated
      voltage of an external power source of the electronic device. However, it would
      have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art before the effective
      filing date of the claimed invention to have the functional element have a withstand
      voltage higher than a rated voltage of an external power source of the electronic
      device, since it has been held that where the general conditions of a claim
      are disclosed in the prior art, discovering the optimum or working ranges involves
      only routine skill in the art.  In re Aller, 105 USPQ 233. It would  have been

      date of the claimed invention to modify the contactor of Kim to provide the

      connect the conductive elastic part and the functional element (refer to [0046]),
      however Kim does not teach wherein the second conductive bonding member has
      a higher melting point than the first conductive bonding member. However, it
      would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art before the
      effective filing date of the claimed invention to have the second conductive
      bonding member have a higher melting point than the first conductive bonding
      member, since it has been held that where the general conditions of a claim
      are disclosed in the prior art, discovering the optimum or working ranges involves

      claim 12, wherein the first conductive bonding member and the second conductive
      bonding member are made of different materials (refer to [0046], [0051], and
      [0078])(Kim teaches that the first conductive bonding member can be made of
      a conductive adhesive or solder and that the second conductive bonding member
      can be made of a conductive adhesive or solder, therefore if the first conductive
      bonding member is made of conductive adhesive, the second conductive bonding
      member can be made of solder or vice versa, thereby having them made of different

      and further in view of Janssen et al. U.S. Patent Application 2014/0160704 (hereinafter
      \u201CJanssen\u201D).\\nRegarding claim 4, Kim teaches the functional contactor
      of claim 3, wherein the conductive elastic part is fastened by means of the
      conductive adhesive layer or through the solder (refer to conductive adhesive
      or solder 120)(fig.2 and 3), however Kim does not teach wherein the functional
      \ element has a groove disposed at an upper side, wherein the second electrode
      is formed on a bottom surface of the groove, and wherein the conductive elastic
      part is fastened inside the groove by means of the conductive adhesive layer

      groove of Janssen to provide the advantage of making the contactor less susceptible
      to breakage and allowing for a smaller device by allowing the circuit board
      to come closer to the conductor.\\nClaims 2 and 12-15 is/are rejected under
      35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable over Lee.\\nRegarding claim 2, Lee teaches
      the functional contactor of claim 1, however Lee does not teach wherein the
      functional element has a withstand voltage higher than a rated voltage of an
      external power source of the electronic device. However, it would have been
      obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art before the effective filing
      date of the claimed invention to have the functional element have a withstand
      voltage higher than a rated voltage of an external power source of the electronic
      device, since it has been held that where the general conditions of a claim
      are disclosed in the prior art, discovering the optimum or working ranges involves
      only routine skill in the art.  In re Aller, 105 USPQ 233. It would have been

      date of the claimed invention to modify the contactor of Lee to provide the
      advantage of preventing damage to the external power source in the event of
      a transient voltage.\\nRegarding claim 12, Kim teaches a functional contactor
      (refer to fig.2) fastened and electrically connected to a substrate (i.e. PCB
      520)(fig.5) by means of a first conductive bonding member (refer to [0071]),
      the functional contactor comprising:  \\ta functional element (i.e. capacitor
      220)(fig.2) including a first electrode (i.e. second external electrode 208)(fig.2)
      and a second electrode (i.e. first external electrode 210)(fig.2), the first
      electrode being brought into contact with the first conductive bonding member
      (implicit); a conductive elastic part (i.e. connecting member 200)(fig.2) disposed
      at an upper portion of the functional element (implicit); and \\ta second conductive
      bonding member (refer to [0071]) interposed between the conductive elastic part
      and the functional element or between the conductive elastic part and the second
      electrode (implicit) in order to fasten and electrically connect the conductive
      elastic part and the functional element (refer to [0071]), however Lee does
      not teach wherein the second conductive bonding member has a higher melting
      point than the first conductive bonding member. However, it would have been
      obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art before the effective filing
      date of the claimed invention to have the second conductive bonding member have
      a higher melting point than the first conductive bonding member, since it has
      been held that where the general conditions of a claim are disclosed in the
      prior art, discovering the optimum or working ranges involves only routine skill
      in the art.  In re Aller, 105 USPQ 233. It would have been obvious to a person
      of ordinary skill in the art before the effective filing date of the claimed
      invention to modify the contactor of Lee to provide the advantage of preventing
      the adhesion between the conductive elastic part and the functional element
      from being damaged when the functional contactor is adhered to the device.\\nRegarding
      claim 13, Lee teaches the functional contactor of claim 12, however Lee does
      not teach wherein the first conductive bonding member and the second conductive
      bonding member are made of different materials, however it would have been obvious
      to a person of ordinary skill in the art before the effective filing date of
      the claimed invention to modify the contactor of Lee to have the first conductive
      bonding member and the second conductive bonding member be made of different
      materials to provide the advantage of preventing the adhesion between the conductive
      elastic part and the functional element from being damaged when the functional
      contactor is adhered to the device. If both the solder of the first conductive
      bonding member and the solder of the second conductive bonding member were made
      of the same materials, then the melting point would be the same, however by
      making the solder out of different materials, the melting point of the second
      conductive bonding member can be higher than the melting point of the first
      conductive bonding member, thereby preventing the functional contactor from
      coming apart when it is adhered to the substrate.\\nRegarding claim 14, Lee
      teaches the functional contactor of claim 12, wherein the functional element
      has at least one selected from the group consisting of an electric shock prevention
      function for blocking a leakage current of an external power source input from

      breakdown when the static electricity is input from the conductive case (refer
      to [0005]). \\nRegarding claim 15, Lee teaches the functional contactor of claim
      12, wherein the conductive elastic part is brought in line contact or point
      contact with the conductor (implicit)([0059]) to decrease galvanic corrosion
      (inherent)(line contact and point contact inherently decrease galvanic corrosion).\\nClaim
      4 is/are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable over Lee as applied
      to claim 3 above, and further in view of Janssen et al. U.S. Patent Application
      2014/0160704 (hereinafter \u201CJanssen\u201D).\\nRegarding claim 4, Lee teaches
      the functional contactor of claim 3, wherein the conductive elastic part is
      fastened by means of the conductive adhesive layer or through the solder (refer
      to [0071]), however Lee does not teach wherein the functional element has a
      groove disposed at an upper side, wherein the second electrode is formed on
      a bottom surface of the groove, and wherein the conductive elastic part is fastened
      inside the groove by means of the conductive adhesive layer or through the solder.
      However, Janssen teaches wherein the functional element has a groove (i.e. recess
      160)(fig.1) disposed at an upper side (implicit), wherein the second electrode
      (i.e. second electrode 132)(fig.1) is formed on a bottom surface of the groove
      (implicit), and wherein the conductive elastic part is fastened inside the groove
      (implicit)(refer to fig.1). It would have been obvious to a person of ordinary
      skill in the art before the effective filing date of the claimed invention to
      modify the contactor of Lee to include the groove of Janssen to provide the
      advantage of making the contactor less susceptible to breakage and allowing
      for a smaller device by allowing the circuit board to come closer to the conductor.\\nClaim
      5 is/are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable over Lee as applied
      to claim 1 above, and further in view of Ling et al. U.S. Patent No. 4,811,164
      (hereinafter \u201CLing\u201D).\\nRegarding claim 5, Lee teaches the functional
      contactor of claim 1, however Lee does not teach wherein the dielectric is made
      of a ceramic material, and wherein the ceramic material is a metal oxide compound
      comprising one or more selected from the group consisting of among Er203, Dy2O3,
      HO2O3, V205, CoO, MoO3, SnO2, BaTiO3, and Nd203, wherein the ceramic material
      is a fired ceramic or a ferrite, or contains any one of a ZnO-based varistor
      material, a Pr-based material, and a Bi-based material, however Ling teaches
      wherein the dielectric is made of a ceramic material (refer to claim 1), and
      wherein the ceramic material is a metal oxide compound comprising one or more
      selected from the group consisting of among Er203, Dy2O3, HO2O3, V205, CoO,
      MoO3, SnO2, BaTiO3, and Nd203 (refer to claim 8), wherein the ceramic material
      is a fired ceramic or a ferrite, or contains any one of a ZnO-based varistor
      material, a Pr-based material, and a Bi-based material (refer to claims 1, 2,
      and 7). It would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art
      before the effective filing date of the claimed invention to modify the contactor
      of Lee to include the ceramics of Ling to provide the advantage of having a
      relatively high capacitance with a relatively small size.\\nConclusion\\nAny

      spurious vertices are excluded.)\\n8.\\tRegarding Claim 3, Somasundaram further
      discloses The method of claim 2, wherein the obfuscating detail comprises at
      least one of 2blurring, pixilating or edge enforcing the rendered view. (paragraph

      in model space for each point is a 2numeric value in a unit of distance corresponding
      to a maximal deviation from a point. (paragraph [0044] reciting \u201C\u2026

      captured (e.g., via a camera and/or video capture device) and subsequently provided
      to mesh generation engine 106 (e.g., as a set of digital files). In stage 306,
      mesh generation engine 106 may subsequently perform a Structure-from-Motion
      process that correlates the captured set of images using one or more distinctive
      features present in the images. Mesh generation engine 106 may be further configured
      to generate a sparse point cloud comprising of 3D locations of those distinctive
      features. In some embodiments, mesh generation engine 106 may be configured
      to process a set of captured images and compare any neighboring images to each
      other in order to identify a small set of distinctive \\\"features\\\" (e.g.,
      freckle, mole, scar, etc.) that appear in at least two of the capture images.
      In some embodiments, multiple images that include a specific feature are taken
      at different angles (e.g., which are close to each other and can be used to
      identify the common feature). Notably, the specific feature that is common to
      the images may be used by mesh generation engine 106 to correlate the multiple

      skill in the art before the effective filing date of the claimed invention to
      modify the combination of Somasundaram and Cappello with Meshram so that the
      mesh is generated from point clouds of set of images.  This is a beneficial
      modification since Somasundaram already discloses generating a mesh of objects
      (not limited to anatomical objects), from a set of images. Thus Meshram can
      be applied to Somasundaram to facilitate that mesh generation.\\n16. \\tRegarding
      claim 113, while the combination of Somasundaram and Cappello does not explicitly

      following is a statement of reasons for the indication of allowable subject
      matter:  Claim 4 recites the limitation wherein an amount of the obfuscating
      detail is weighted based 2 on uncertainty in screen space to visually quantify
      uncertainty which is not disclosed in any of the cited references, singly or
      in combination.\\n20.\\tClaim 6 depends from claim 4.\\n21.\\tClaim 17 recites
      the limitation wherein the rendered view is an original frame having a 2plurality
      of pixels and the computing uncertainty in screen space for each point produces
      3an uncertainty image having same dimensions as the original frame that provides
      an 4uncertainty in screen space for each pixel in the original frame which is
      not disclosed in any of the cited references, singly or in combination. \\n22.\\tClaim
      8 depends from claim 7.\\n23. \\tClaim 112 recites the limitation The computing

      based on uncertainty in screen space to visually quantify uncertainty which
      is not disclosed in any of the cited references, singly or in combination.\\n24.\\tClaim
      116 recites the limitation wherein the 2uncertainty in model space for each
      point is a numeric value in a unit of distance 3corresponding to a maximal deviation
      from a point which forms a sphere about the point, 4and the instructions when
      executed are further operable to: sfor each point, project the sphere on the
      screen to form a region of pixels; and 6determine a bounding circle for the
      region having a diameter that serves as the uncertainty in screen space which
      is not disclosed in any of the cited references, singly or in combination.\\n25.\\tClaim
      117 recites the limitation wherein the 2rendered view is an original frame having
      a plurality of pixels and the computation of 3uncertainty in screen space for
      each point produces an uncertainty image having same 4dimensions as the original

      includes the determined parameter of the product, the start and end times, and
      the product count to associate, within the controller, the measured amount of
      the adhesive flowing out of the flow outlet with the sensed product and compare
      the associated amount of adhesive with a predetermined range to determine if
      the associated amount is outside the predetermined range as recited in the claim.
      \ Further, no other prior art was located that fairly suggested the claimed
      invention in whole or in part, along with the requisite motivation for combination,
      to anticipate or render the claimed invention obvious.\\nIn regards to independent
      claim 40, the prior art has been discussed, but is silent in regards to the
      added limitations of the claimed features of a flow meter comprising a flow
      inlet, a flow outlet, and a pair of sensors configured to provide a quadrature
      output, the flow meter being measures an amount of the adhesive flowing out
      of the flow outlet, as recited in the claim.  Further, no other prior art was
      located that fairly suggested the claimed invention in whole or in part, along
      with the requisite motivation for combination, to anticipate or render the claimed
      invention obvious.\\n\\nAny comments considered necessary by applicant must

      35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Juang et al. (US Pat. 5,710,864,
      Applicant\u2019s IDS, hereinafter referred to as Juang) in view of Schalk et
      al. (US Pat. 6,922,669, Applicant\u2019s IDS, hereinafter referred to as Schalk).\\nRegarding
      claim 1, Juang discloses a method for recognizing speech comprising the steps
      of:\\nreceiving input speech from a user (fig. 1a);\\ngenerating acoustic features
      of the input speech (fig. 1a, #102); \\ncomparing the input speech acoustic
      features to a model associated with at least one expected response to generate
      an associated confidence factor (fig. 1a and fig. 6, col. 7, line 19-55,  detecting
      keywords, comparing likelihood ratio with a decision threshold);\\ncomparing
      the confidence factor to an acceptance threshold for accepting the expected
      response as the result of the speech recognition (fig. 1a and fig. 6, col. 7,
      line 19-55,  detecting keywords, comparing likelihood with decision threshold).\\nJuang
      discloses a method of detecting and recognizing spoken keywords (fig. 1b, detecting
      keyword hypothesis in context). Juang discloses all claimed features  of in
      claim 1 (Examiner note, Juang discloses recognizing keywords which are one expected
      response). The Examiner understands in light of specification ([0021], [0032])
      that the claimed \u201Cat least one expected response\u201D means that a user
      is most likely to speak digit strings. To advance prosecution, the Examiner
      cites Schalk for teaching comparing expected response. \\nSchalk discloses prompting
      a use to speak digit strings and then verifying recognized digit strings (expected
      responses) based on various knowledge (Schalk, Fig. 1, col. 1 \u2013 5, verifying
      recognized digit strings by calculating checksum, search database, or verifying
      string length; Examiner notes, the disclosure (Spec., [0053]) also shows Schalk
      (US PG Pub. 2003/0154075 which is PG Pub of US Pat. 6,922,669) determining if
      a response is an expected response).\\nIt would have been obvious to a person
      having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to combine
      Juang with Schalk to detect and compare if recognized words are expected responses.
      One having ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to make such
      a modification to improve accuracy (Schalk, col. 1, line 44-46).\\n Claim 6
      is directed to an apparatus and includes features similar to claim 1. Therefore,
      claim 6 is rejected based on the same rationale. See explanation above for claim
      1.\\n Regarding claims 2 and 8, Juang and Schalk discloses adjusting threshold
      to affect acceptance of the expected response (Juang, col. 7, line29-35; Schalk,
      col. 4, line 5-13);\\nRegarding claims 3 and 9, Juang and Schalk discloses if
      the comparison to the expected response does not yield a confidence factor exceeding
      the acceptance threshold, comparing the input speech features to models associated
      with additional responses (Juang, fig. 6; Schalk, fig. 1).\\nRegarding claims
      4, 5, 7, 10, Juang and Schalk further disclose comparing with a subset models
      (Juang, col. 6, line 10-50, Viterbi search for certain word such as \u201CCARD\u201D;
      Schalk, col. 2, line 45-50, Viterbi beam search).\\n Claims 11-20 are rejected
      under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Juang in view of Schalk and
      further in view of Bartur et al. (US PG Pub. 2005/0049873).\\nRegarding claim
      11, Juang discloses a method for recognizing speech comprising the steps of:\\n
      in a speech dialog, determining an expected response to be received as input
      speech from a user (fig. 1b, recognizing and detecting spoken keyword (expected
      response));\\nprocessing input speech from a user using a match/search algorithm
      to generate a hypothesis and confidence factor for the input speech (col. 7,
      line 19-35, using Viterbi algorithm to detect keywords).\\nJuang discloses recognizing
      and detecting spoken keywords using HMM and Viterbi search algorithm (col. 1,
      line 35, fig. 1b, col. 7, line 19). Viterbi search algorithm is a dynamic programming
      algorithm which implicitly discloses \\\"based upon the expected response, modifying
      a speech recognition match/search algorithm to tailor the speech recognition
      match/search algorithm to the expected response\u201D. Schalk discloses recognizing
      and verifying spoken digits using Viterbi beam search algorithm (Schalk, Fig.
      1, Col. 1, line 45-55). In light of specification, the claimed features are
      based on Spec. ([0037-0039]). To advance prosecution, the Examiner cites Bartur
      for teaching pruning Viterbi search paths. \\nBartur discloses pruning Viterbi
      search paths based on current word active state range (fig. 2, fig. 4 and 5,
      [0037][0043-0044]).\\nIt would have been obvious to a person having ordinary
      skill in the art at the time the invention was made to modify Juang in view
      of Schalk's teaching with Bartur teaching to change Viterbi search range based
      on words. One having ordinary skill in  the art would have been motivated to
      make such a modification to increase speed ([0043]).\\n Claim 16 is directed
      to an apparatus and includes features similar to claim 11. Therefore, claim
      16 is rejected. See explanation for claim 11.\\nRegarding claims 12-15 and 17-20,
      Juang, Schalk, and Bartur discloses comparing confidence factor to an acceptance
      threshold (Juang, col. 7, line 19-35); modifying transition probabilities (Juang,
      fig. 1a, training HMM model which modifies transition probabilities); modifying
      acoustic model (Examiner note: adapting acoustic model is well known); applying
      bias or penalty per frame to the input speech to affect the scores of paths
      through the models (Schalk,Col. 2, line 45-50,  Viterbi Beam search, Bartur,
      Fig. 2, fig. 5, pruning Viterbi search paths)\\n\"],\n        \"sections.submissionDate\":\"2012-08-30T04:00:00Z\",\n

      recognized digit strings (expected responses) based on various knowledge (Schalk,
      Fig. 1, col. 1 \u2013 5, verifying recognized digit strings by calculating checksum,
      search database, or verifying string length; Examiner notes, the disclosure
      (Spec., [0053]) also shows Schalk (US PG Pub. 2003/0154075 which is PG Pub of
      US Pat. 6,922,669) determining if a response is an expected response).\\n\\nIt
      would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the
      time the invention was made to combine Juang with Schalk to detect and compare
      if recognized words are expected responses. One having ordinary skill in the
      art would have been motivated to make such a modification to improve accuracy
      (Schalk, col. 1, line 44-46).\\n\\nClaim 6 is directed to an apparatus and includes
      features similar to claim 1. Therefore, claim 6 is rejected based on the same
      rationale. See explanation above for claim 1.\\n\\n Regarding claims 2 and 8,
      Juang and Schalk discloses adjusting threshold to affect acceptance of the expected
      response (Juang, col. 7, line29-35; Schalk, col. 4, line 5-13);\\n\\nRegarding
      claims 3 and 9, Juang and Schalk discloses if the comparison to the expected
      response does not yield a confidence factor exceeding the acceptance threshold,
      comparing the input speech features to models associated with additional responses
      (Juang, fig. 6; Schalk, fig. 1).\\n\\nRegarding claims 4, 5, 7, 10, Juang and
      Schalk further disclose comparing with a subset models (Juang, col. 6, line
      10-50, Viterbi search for certain word such as \u201CCARD\u201D; Schalk, col.
      2, line 45-50, Viterbi beam search).\\n\\nClaims 11-20 are rejected under 35
      U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Juang in view of Schalk and further
      in view of Bartur et al. (US PG Pub. 2005/0049873).\\n\\nRegarding claim 11,
      Juang discloses a method for recognizing speech comprising the steps of:\\n\\n
      in a speech dialog, determining an expected response to be received as input
      speech from a user (fig. 1b, recognizing and detecting spoken keyword (expected
      response));\\nprocessing input speech from a user using a match/search algorithm
      to generate a hypothesis and confidence factor for the input speech (col. 7,
      line 19-35, using Viterbi algorithm to detect keywords).\\nJuang discloses recognizing
      and detecting spoken keywords using HMM and Viterbi search algorithm (col. 1,
      line 35, fig. 1b, col. 7, line 19). Viterbi search algorithm is a dynamic programming
      algorithm which implicitly discloses \\\"based upon the expected response, modifying
      a speech recognition match/search algorithm to tailor the speech recognition
      match/search algorithm to the expected response\u201D. Schalk discloses recognizing
      and verifying spoken digits using Viterbi beam search algorithm (Schalk, Fig.
      1, Col. 1, line 45-55). In light of specification, the claimed features are
      based on Spec. ([0037-0039]). To advance prosecution, the Examiner cites Bartur
      for teaching pruning Viterbi search paths. \\nBartur discloses pruning Viterbi
      search paths based on current word active state range (fig. 2, fig. 4 and 5,
      [0037][0043-0044]).\\n\\nIt would have been obvious to a person having ordinary
      skill in the art at the time the invention was made to modify Juang in view
      of Schalk's teaching with Bartur teaching to change Viterbi search range based
      on words. One having ordinary skill in  the art would have been motivated to
      make such a modification to increase speed ([0043]).\\n\\nClaim 16 is directed
      to an apparatus and includes features similar to claim 11. Therefore, claim
      16 is rejected. See explanation for claim 11.\\n\\nRegarding claims 12-15 and
      17-20, Juang, Schalk, and Bartur discloses comparing confidence factor to an
      acceptance threshold (Juang, col. 7, line 19-35); modifying transition probabilities
      (Juang, fig. 1a, training HMM model which modifies transition probabilities);
      modifying acoustic model (Examiner note: adapting acoustic model is well known);
      applying bias or penalty per frame to the input speech to affect the scores
      of paths through the models (Schalk,Col. 2, line 45-50,  Viterbi Beam search,
      Bartur, Fig. 2, fig. 5, pruning Viterbi search paths)\\n\\nConclusion\\nThe
      prior art made of record and not relied upon is considered pertinent to applicant's
      disclosure. \\nKibkalo et al. (US Pat. 7,493,258) discloses dynamically modifying
      Viterbi beam search width.\\n\\nAny inquiry concerning this communication or

      1-3 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being obvious over Boon et al ( 6,451,949).\\nThe
      use of phrase \u201Cfor use as a polymer electrolyte\u201D in the claim 1 has
      not been treated with patentability. A recitation of the intended use of the
      claimed invention must result in a structural difference between the claimed
      invention and the prior art in order to patentably distinguish the claimed invention
      from the prior art. If the prior art structure is capable of performing the
      intended use, then it meets the claim. In a claim drawn to a process of making,
      the intended use must result in a manipulative difference as compared to the
      prior art. See In re Casey, 152 USPQ 235 (CCPA 1967) and In re Otto, 136 USPQ
      458, 459 (CCPA 1963).\\nBoon et al teach the composition of poly(trimethylene
      carbonate) polymer, and making it by reacting trimethyl carbonate and polyhydric
      alcohol in presence of  an acetate of Gp-IA or IIA element such as sodium acetate
      (preferred catalyst/polar material) as catalyst, and the catalyst remains distributed
      throughout  the polymer matrix. The prior art teaches the molecular weight of
      high polymer to be greater than 30,000. The catalyst content ranged from less
      than 1 ppm to greater than 10,000 ppm (1 wt%) (Abstract; Cl-4, Ln 4-35; Cl-5,
      Ln 25-32; Cl-6, Ln 3-6; Example-1). \\nThe prior art fails to teach the instant
      claimed range of the catalyst/polar material in the composition.\\nHowever,
      the greater than 10,000 ppm is more than 1 wt% that will overlap over the low
      end of 1 wt% in the instant claimed range, and furthermore, it would have been
      obvious to a person of ordinary skilled in the art to add more than 10,000 ppm
      sodium acetate catalyst  to the reaction mixture to benefit from increased rate
      of reaction and greater transparency of the product because the prior art is
      suggestive of it (Cl-4, Ln 17-20), and In the case where the claimed ranges
      \\\"overlap or lie inside ranges disclosed by the prior art\\\" a prima facie
      case of obviousness exists. In re Wertheim, 541 F.2d 257, 191 USPQ 90 (CCPA
      1976); In re Woodruff, 919 F.2d 1575, 16 USPQ2d 1934 (Fed. Cir. 1990).\\nWith
      regard to \\\"y\u201D ratio in claim-1 and molecular weight in claim-2,  the
      prior art disclose a poly (tmc) polyester of carbonic acid with a diol, and
      having a molecular weight of more than 30,000 daltons that overlaps with greater
      than 30,000, and the polyester is similar to that claimed by the applicants
      and similar compositions possess similar properties. \\n Claims 1-3 and 5 are
      rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being obvious over either Shastri et al (
      6,471,993) or Shastri et al (WO 99/09149).\\nThe prior art by Shastri et al
      (US 6,471,993) is being used as an equivalent/translation of WO 99/09149) in
      the present rejection.\\nShastri et al teaches a solid state polymeric electrolyte
      composition for battery and fuel-cell applications comprising a polymer/copolymer
      of trimethylene carbonate and an additive of inorganic/sodium salts such as
      sodium chloride, wherein the polymers had a molecular weight of at least 40,000
      daltons (Cl-11, Ln 18- 20, Cl-12, Ln 54-58, Cl-13, Ln 38-39, Cl-22, Ln 66 to
      Cl-23, Ln 19). The prior art further teaches adding inorganic metal salts to
      the matrix forming conductive compositions (Cl-23, Ln 10-19). The mixing of
      the components in forming the composition would be obvious. \\nThe prior art
      fails to teach the amount of the salt added in making in the conductive composition,
      and  the molecular weight of the polymer per claim-3.\\nThe addition of a small
      amount of the salt in making the conductive composition lies close to the low
      end of the instant claimed range of 1-50 wt% polar materials, and In the case
      where the claimed ranges \\\"overlap or lie inside ranges disclosed by the prior
      art\\\", or where the claimed ranges and prior art ranges do not overlap but
      are close enough that one skilled in the art would have expected them to have
      the same properties, a prima facie case of obviousness exists. <MPEP 2144.05
      [R-5]-I>.\\nWith regard to \\\"y\u201D ratios in claim-1 and molecular weight
      in claim-2,  the prior art/s disclose a poly (tmc) polyester of carbonic acid
      with diol and having a molecular weight of more than 40,000 daltons that overlaps
      with greater than 30,000, and the polyester is similar to that claimed by the
      applicants and similar compositions possess similar properties.\\nWith regard
      to claim-5, it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skilled in the
      art to use the conductive polymer of Shastri in a battery or fuel cell with
      reasonable expectation of success because the prior art is suggestive of its
      use and the instant claimed method would be obvious.\\nClaim-4 is rejected under
      35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Shastri et al (WO 99/09149) in view
      of Gill et al (US 5,985,487).\\nThe disclosure by Shastri et al (WO-149) as
      set forth in rejection-2 under 35 USC 103(a) is herein incorporated. \\nThe
      prior art is silent about the addition of a plasticizer per the claims, although
      it is common to do such an addition in the art. \\nIn the analogous art, Gill
      et al teaches the benefit of low molecular weight organic solvent/plasticizer
      in the dispersion of salt in the solid polymer electrolyte such as short chain
      or cyclic carbonates (Cl-1, Ln 49-63; Cl-4, Ln 43- 67).\\nIt would have been
      obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art to combine the prior art teachings
      to add solvent/plasticizer to the conductive polymer of Shastri et al to benefit
      from improved dispersion of electrolyte/salts with reasonable expectation of
      success, because the teachings have a common utility as solid polymer electrolytes.\\n\"],\n

      following is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 103(a) which forms the basis for all obviousness
      rejections set forth in this Office action:\\n(a) A patent may not be obtained
      though the invention is not identically disclosed or described as set forth
      in section 102 of this title, if the differences between the subject matter
      sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as
      a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person
      having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.  Patentability
      shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made.\\n\\nThe
      factual inquiries set forth in Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 148 USPQ
      459 (1966), that are applied for establishing a background for determining obviousness
      under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) are summarized as follows:\\n1.\\tDetermining the scope
      and contents of the prior art.\\n2.\\tAscertaining the differences between the
      prior art and the claims at issue.\\n3.\\tResolving the level of ordinary skill
      in the pertinent art.\\n4.\\tConsidering objective evidence present in the application
      indicating obviousness or nonobviousness.\\n\\nThis application currently names
      joint inventors.  In considering patentability of the claims under 35 U.S.C.
      103(a), the examiner presumes that the subject matter of the various claims
      was commonly owned at the time any inventions covered therein were made absent
      any evidence to the contrary.  Applicant is advised of the obligation under
      37 CFR 1.56 to point out the inventor and invention dates of each claim that
      was not commonly owned at the time a later invention was made in order for the
      examiner to consider the applicability of 35 U.S.C. 103(c) and potential 35
      U.S.C. 102(e), (f) or (g) prior art under 35 U.S.C. 103(a).\\nClaims 1-3 are
      rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being obvious over Boon et al ( 6,451,949).\\nThe
      use of phrase \u201Cfor use as a polymer electrolyte\u201D in the claim 1 has
      not been treated with patentability. A recitation of the intended use of the
      claimed invention must result in a structural difference between the claimed
      invention and the prior art in order to patentably distinguish the claimed invention
      from the prior art. If the prior art structure is capable of performing the
      intended use, then it meets the claim. In a claim drawn to a process of making,
      the intended use must result in a manipulative difference as compared to the
      prior art. See In re Casey, 152 USPQ 235 (CCPA 1967) and In re Otto, 136 USPQ
      458, 459 (CCPA 1963).\\n\\nBoon et al teach the composition of poly(trimethylene
      carbonate) polymer, and making it by reacting trimethyl carbonate and polyhydric
      alcohol in presence of  an acetate of Gp-IA or IIA element such as sodium acetate
      (preferred catalyst/polar material) as catalyst, and the catalyst remains distributed
      throughout  the polymer matrix. The prior art teaches the molecular weight of
      high polymer to be greater than 30,000. The catalyst content ranged from less
      than 1 ppm to greater than 10,000 ppm (1 wt%) (Abstract; Cl-4, Ln 4-35; Cl-5,
      Ln 25-32; Cl-6, Ln 3-6; Example-1). \\nThe prior art fails to teach the instant
      claimed range of the catalyst/polar material in the composition.\\nHowever,
      the greater than 10,000 ppm is more than 1 wt% that will overlap over the low
      end of 1 wt% in the instant claimed range, and furthermore, it would have been
      obvious to a person of ordinary skilled in the art to add more than 10,000 ppm
      sodium acetate catalyst  to the reaction mixture to benefit from increased rate
      of reaction and greater transparency of the product because the prior art is
      suggestive of it (Cl-4, Ln 17-20), and In the case where the claimed ranges
      \\\"overlap or lie inside ranges disclosed by the prior art\\\" a prima facie
      case of obviousness exists. In re Wertheim, 541 F.2d 257, 191 USPQ 90 (CCPA
      1976); In re Woodruff, 919 F.2d 1575, 16 USPQ2d 1934 (Fed. Cir. 1990).\\nWith
      regard to \\\"y\u201D ratio in claim-1 and molecular weight in claim-2,  the
      prior art disclose a poly (tmc) polyester of carbonic acid with a diol, and
      having a molecular weight of more than 30,000 daltons that overlaps with greater
      than 30,000, and the polyester is similar to that claimed by the applicants
      and similar compositions possess similar properties. \\nClaims 1-3 and 5 are
      rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being obvious over either Shastri et al (
      6,471,993) or Shastri et al (WO 99/09149).\\nThe prior art by Shastri et al
      (US 6,471,993) is being used as an equivalent/translation of WO 99/09149) in

      the matrix forming conductive compositions (Cl-23, Ln 10-19). The mixing of
      the components in forming the composition would be obvious. \\nThe prior art
      fails to teach the amount of the salt added in making in the conductive composition,

      the same properties, a prima facie case of obviousness exists. <MPEP 2144.05
      [R-5]-I>.\\nWith regard to \\\"y\u201D ratios in claim-1 and molecular weight
      in claim-2,  the prior art/s disclose a poly (tmc) polyester of carbonic acid
      with diol and having a molecular weight of more than 40,000 daltons that overlaps

      under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Shastri et al (WO 99/09149)
      in view of Gill et al (US 5,985,487).\\nThe disclosure by Shastri et al (WO-149)
      as set forth in rejection-2 under 35 USC 103(a) is herein incorporated. \\nThe
      prior art is silent about the addition of a plasticizer per the claims, although
      it is common to do such an addition in the art. \\nIn the analogous art, Gill
      et al teaches the benefit of low molecular weight organic solvent/plasticizer
      in the dispersion of salt in the solid polymer electrolyte such as short chain
      or cyclic carbonates (Cl-1, Ln 49-63; Cl-4, Ln 43- 67).\\nIt would have been

      representing planned movements of the vehicle in a geographic area, the vehicle
      having a planned route from a first location to a second location, and (ii)
      data representing parameters for acceptable variation in the planned route,
      wherein, for the vehicle, the parameters for acceptable variation in the planned
      route comprise an operational limitation for the vehicle, wherein the parameters
      for acceptable variation constrain an amount of variation in the planned route.\\nWith
      respect to independent claim 8, Kennedy, taken singly or in combination with

      1 \u2013 17 is/are rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable
      over Mellitz et al (US 2009/0110043) in view of Shah (US 2008/0080607).\\nRegarding
      claim 1, Mellitz et al teach a method of automated adaptation of a transmitter
      equalizer (see figure 3), the method comprising: dividing a multi-dimensional
      search space of tap settings for the transmitter equalizer into multiple single-dimensional
      search spaces (Mellitz et al teaches setting the taps for post cursor and pre
      cursor separately see figure 1 and paragraph 0012), each single- dimensional
      search space being associated with a single tap of the transmitter equalizer
      (see figure 1 and 3); searching the multiple single-dimensional search spaces
      in series (see paragraph 0012); and setting a tap for a single-dimensional search
      space before searching a next single-dimensional search space (see paragraph

      metric of signal. Therefore it would have been obvious to an ordinary skilled
      in the art at the time the invention was made to use BER instead of eye width
      value. Choosing BER instead of eye width is a matter of design choice. Further,
      in analogous art, Shah teaches determining BER to estimate equalizer taps (see
      figure 3 and paragraph 0019). Therefore it would have been obvious to an ordinary
      skilled in the art at the time the invention was made to use BER instead of
      eye width value. Mellitz et al in view of Shah teach determining bit error rates
      for multiple predetermined settings; determining a predetermined setting with

      to a minimum error rate (see paragraph 0015).  \\nRegarding claim 3, which inherits
      the limitations of claim 2, Mellitz et al in view of Shah teach wherein finding
      the tap value which corresponds to the minimum bit error rate comprises: decrementing
      a current tap value to a next lower value; finding a current bit error count
      for the current tap value; comparing the current bit error count for the current
      tap value with a saved bit error count stored in a register; and replacing the
      saved bit error count with the current bit error count if the current bit error
      count is less than the saved bit error count (Mellitz et al paragraph 0015 and
      Shah, figure 2 and 3).\\nRegarding claim 4, which inherits the limitations of
      claim 3, Mellitz et al in view of Shah teach wherein finding the tap value which
      corresponds to the minimum bit error rate further comprises: incrementing a
      boundary count if the current bit error count is equal to the saved bit error
      count (Mellitz et al paragraph 0015 and Shah figure 2 and 3).\\nRegarding claim
      5, which inherits the limitations of claim 4, Mellitz et al in view of Shah
      teach wherein finding the tap value which corresponds to the minimum bit error
      rate further comprises: incrementing the current tap value by the boundary count
      divided by two if the current bit error count is greater than the saved bit
      error count (Mellitz et al paragraph 0015 and Shah figure 2 and 3 further the
      difference is within the scope of one of ordinary skilled in the art).\\nRegarding

      Shah teach wherein a first single-dimensional search space that is searched
      comprises a voltage output differential tap of the transmitter equalizer (Mellitz
      et al paragraph 0015 and Shah figure 2 and 3 further the difference is within
      the scope of one of ordinary skilled in the art).\\nRegarding claim 7, which
      inherits the limitations of claim 6, Mellitz et al further teach wherein a second
      single- dimensional search space that is searched comprises a post-tap of the
      transmitter equalizer (see paragraph 0012).\\nRegarding claim 8, which inherits
      the limitations of claim 7, Mellitz et al further teach wherein a third single-
      dimensional search space that is searched comprises a pre-tap of the transmitter

      tap values for a transmitter equalizer (see figure 1), the method comprising:
      setting the tap values to an initialize setting (see figure 1 and paragraph
      0011); determining a error rate for the initialize setting (see figure 0015);
      indicating to the transmitter to use the initialize setting if the bit error
      rate for the initialize setting is determined to be acceptable (see paragraph
      0015 and 0016); setting the tap values to a preset setting if the error rate
      for the initialize setting is determined to be non-acceptable (see paragraph
      0015 and 0016); determining the error rate for the preset setting (see paragraph
      0015 and 0016); and indicating to the transmitter to use the preset setting
      if the bit error rate for the preset setting is determined to be acceptable
      (see paragraph 0015 and 0016). ).  Mellitz teaches determining the tap values
      based on eye width values. Further teach can use \u201Cany eye quality metric
      that affects BER\\\". Mellitz does not expressly disclose determine the BER
      to adjust the taps. However, in analogous art, Shah teaches determining BER
      to estimate equalizer taps (see figure 3 and paragraph 0019). Further, both
      eye width values and BER are quality metric of signal. Therefore it would have
      been obvious to an ordinary skilled in the art at the time the invention was
      made to use BER instead of eye width value. Choosing BER instead of eye width
      and the threshold value to be zero is a matter of design choice.\\nRegarding
      claim 11, which inherits the limitations of claim 10, Mellitz et al in view
      of Shah further teach further comprising: determining whether the bit error
      rate for the initialize setting or the bit error rate for the preset setting
      is lower; indicating to the transmitter to use the initialize setting if the
      bit error rate for the initialize setting is lower; and indicating to the transmitter
      to use the preset setting if the bit error rate for the preset setting is lower

      figure 1 and paragraph 0012); search the multiple single-dimensional search
      spaces in series (see paragraph 0012); and set a tap for a single-dimensional

      predetermined settings, and select the predetermined setting with the lowest
      bit error rate. if an adjustment error occurs while searching the multiple single-dimensional
      search spaces (Mellitz et al paragraph 0015 and Shah figure 2 and 3 further
      the difference is within the scope of one of ordinary skilled in the art).\\nRegarding
      claim 13, which inherits the limitations of claim 12, Mellitz et al in view
      of Shah further teach wherein the adaptation circuitry if further configured
      to search a single-dimensional search space by finding a tap value which corresponds
      to a minimum bit error rate (Mellitz et al paragraph 0015 and Shah, figure 2
      and 3).\\nRegarding claim 14, which inherits the limitations of claim 13, Mellitz
      et al in view of Shah further teach wherein finding the tap value which corresponds
      to the minimum bit error rate comprises: decrementing a current tap value to
      a next lower value; finding a current bit error count for the current tap value;
      comparing the current bit error count for the current tap value with a saved
      bit error count stored in a register; and replacing the saved bit error count
      with the current bit error count if the current bit error count is less than
      the saved bit error count (Mellitz et al paragraph 0015 and Shah, figure 2 and
      3).\\nRegarding claim 15, which inherits the limitations of claim 14, Mellitz
      et al in view of Shah further teach wherein finding the tap value which corresponds
      to the minimum bit error rate further comprises: incrementing a boundary count
      if the current bit error count is equal to the saved bit error count; and incrementing
      the current tap value by the boundary count divided by two if the current bit
      error count is greater than the saved bit error count (Mellitz et al paragraph
      0015 and Shah figure 2 and 3 further the difference is within the scope of one
      of ordinary skilled in the art).\\nRegarding claim 16, which inherits the limitations
      of claim 13, Mellitz et al in view of Shah further teach wherein a first single-
      dimensional search space that is searched comprises a voltage output differential
      tap of the transmitter equalizer, a second single-dimensional search space that
      is searched comprises a post-tap of the transmitter equalizer, and a third single-dimensional
      search space that is searched comprises a pre-tap of the transmitter equalizer
      (see paragraph 0012).\\nRegarding claim 17, which inherits the limitations of
      claim 12, Mellitz et al in view of Shah further teach wherein the multiple predetermined
      settings comprise an initialize setting and a preset setting (see figure 1 and
      paragraph 0011).\\n\\nConclusion\\nExaminer's Note: Examiner has cited particular

      over Pichel (US Patent Application 2012/0288359) in view of Kumar et al. (US
      Patent 2015/0159560).\\nIn regards to claim 1, Pichel discloses a bleed off
      valve (BOV) for a gas turbine engine (10) having a gaspath bounded by a radially
      outer annular wall (31) extending about an axis (1) of the gas turbine engine,
      the radially outer annular wall having a converging portion (Fig. 2); the BOV
      comprising:\\na ring (32 including 33, par. 8) axially translatable between
      a retracted position (Fig. 3) in which the ring is configured to close an annular
      bleed off opening defined in the converging portion of the radially outer annular
      wall and a deployed position (Fig. 2) in which the ring (see divider projection
      33) is configured to protrude into the gaspath (par. 26), the ring having a
      gas path facing surface to form a section of the radially outer annular wall
      when in its retracted position (Fig. 3); and \\nan actuator operatively connected
      to the ring to axially translate the ring between the retracted and deployed
      positions (par. 26).\\nPichel does not disclose in the retracted position, the
      ring is configured to close the annular bleed off opening directly at an outer
      flow boundary of the gaspath and the gaspath facing surface of the ring forms
      a continuous and smooth flow boundary surface with the radially outer annular
      wall, the gaspath facing surface extending at an angle relative to the axis
      so as to have an axial component and a radial component.\\nKumar et al., which
      is also directed to a bleed valve translated into a gaspath of a compressor
      for extraction of foreign matter, disclose, in the retracted position, an annular
      wedge (24) configured to close an annular bleed off opening (26) directly at
      an outer flow boundary of a gaspath (12) and the gas path facing surface of
      the ring forms a continuous and smooth flow boundary surface with the radially
      outer annular wall, the gaspath facing surface extending at an angle relative
      to the axis so as to have an axial component and a radial component (Figs. 3-4).\\n
      Pichel discloses a bleed valve that is translated into a gaspath of a compressor
      for extraction of foreign matter, however do not disclose in the retracted position,
      the ring is configured to close the annular bleed off opening directly at an
      outer flow boundary of the gaspath and the gaspath facing surface of the ring
      forms a continuous and smooth flow boundary surface with the radially outer
      annular wall, the gaspath facing surface extending at an angle relative to the
      axis so as to have an axial component and a radial component. Kumar et al.,
      which is also directed to a bleed valve translated into a gaspath of a compressor
      for extraction of foreign matter, disclose, in the retracted position, an annular
      wedge configured to close an annular bleed off opening directly at an outer
      flow boundary of a gaspath to provide a flush surface to improve the flow of
      gas when the valves is not being deployed. Thus, it would have been obvious
      to one having ordinary skill in the art before the effective filing of the claimed
      invention to modify the bleed off valve of Pichel, by providing in the retracted
      position, the actuated member is configured to close the annular bleed off opening
      directly at an outer flow boundary of the gaspath and the gaspath facing surface
      of the actuated member forms a continuous and smooth flow boundary surface with
      the radially outer annular wall, the gaspath facing surface extending at an
      angle relative to the axis so as to have an axial component and a radial component,
      as taught by Kumar, to provide a flush surface to improve the flow of gas when
      the valve is not being deployed.\\nFurthermore, applicant's claimed invention
      only differs from the applied prior art by a mere substitution of the bleed
      valve configuration, where both applicant\u2019s claimed elements, and that
      of the prior art, were both well known in the art before the effective filing
      date of the claimed invention.  One having ordinary skill in the art before
      the effective filing date of the claimed invention would have recognized that
      upon substitution of the bleed valve configuration that is continuous and smooth
      at the radially outer wall, according to known methods, predictable results
      would have followed.  Accordingly, it would have been obvious to one having
      ordinary skill in the art before the effective filing date of the claimed invention
      to modify the applied prior art to include these taught limitations. \\nIn regards
      to claim 2, the modified bleed off valve of Pichel comprises the ring has a

      of the radially outer annular wall of the gaspath towards the bleed off opening
      (Pichel Fig. 2, Kumar Fig. 1). \\nIn regards to claim 6, the modified bleed
      off valve of Pichel comprises in the retracted position (Fig. 3), the ring mates
      with a corresponding annular seal (35, or 40) adapted to be mounted to the radially
      outer annular wall (Fig. 3).\\nIn regards to claim 9, Pichel discloses a gas
      turbine engine (10) comprising: \\na compressor having a gaspath bounded by

      position (Fig. 3) in which the ring closes an annular bleed off opening defined
      in the converging portion of the radially outer annular wall and a deployed
      position (Fig. 2) in which the ring (see divider projection 33) protrudes forwardly
      into the gaspath (Fig. 2, par. 26); and \\nan actuator operable to axially translate
      the ring between the retracted and the deployed positions (par. 26).\\nPichel
      does not disclose the ring has a gaspath facing surface, which is set even with
      the radially outer annular wall to close the annular bleed off opening when
      the ring is in its retracted position so as to form with the radially outer
      wall a continuous flow boundary surface, the gaspath facing surface being inclined
      relative to the axis so as to have a radial component and an axial component
      relative to the axis.\\nKumar et al., which is also directed to a bleed valve
      translated into a gaspath of a compressor for extraction of foreign matter,
      disclose an annular wedge (24) has a gaspath facing surface (Fig. 4), which
      is set even with the radially outer annular wall to close an annular bleed off
      opening when the wedge is in its retracted position so as to form with the radially
      outer wall a continuous flow boundary surface, the gaspath facing surface being
      inclined relative to the axis so as to have a radial component and an axial
      component relative to the axis (Fig. 4). \\nPichel discloses a bleed valve that
      is translated into a gaspath of a compressor for extraction of foreign matter,
      however do not disclose the ring has a gaspath facing surface, which is set

      substitution of the bleed valve configuration, where both applicant\u2019s claimed
      elements, and that of the prior art, were both well known in the art before

      in the art before the effective filing date of the claimed invention would have
      recognized that upon substitution of the bleed valve closing the opening even
      with the radially outer wall of Kumar et al. for the bleed valve recessed from
      the radially outer wall, according to known methods, predictable results would
      have followed.  Accordingly, it would have been obvious to one having ordinary
      skill in the art before the effective filing date of the claimed invention to
      modify the applied prior art to include these taught limitations. \\nIn regards
      to claim 11, the modified gas turbine engine of Pichel comprises the BOV is
      disposed in a compressor section downstream of a compressor rotor (Pichel Figs.
      2-3).\\n In regards to claim 12, the modified gas turbine engine of Pichel comprises
      the ring has a bleed off opening facing surface (on divider projection 33) opposite
      to said gaspath facing surface thereof, the bleed off facing surface being configured
      to redirect an incoming flow through the annular bleed off opening (Pichel Fig.
      2, Kumar Figs. 3-4).\\nIn regards to claim 15, Pichel discloses a method of
      extracting water/hail (pars. 11, 14, 30) and/or air (via duct 30) from a core
      gas path of a compressor of a gas turbine engine (10), the compressor rotatable
      about an axis, the method comprising:\\n\\tdisplacing axially a ring (32 including
      33) from a retracted position (Fig. 3) in which the ring closes a corresponding
      annular bleed off opening defined in a converging portion of a radially outer
      annular wall (31) of the core gaspath to a deployed position (Fig. 2) in which
      the ring (see divider projection 33) protrudes axially forwardly into the core
      gaspath to scoop water/hail particles and/or air out of the core gaspath via
      the annular bleed off opening (Fig. 2, par. 26).\\nPichel et al. do not disclose
      the ring having a gaspath facing surface to form a section of the radially outer
      annular wall when in its retracted position, the gaspath facing surface having
      an axial component and a radial component relative to the axis, the ring closing
      the annular bleed off opening directly at an outer flow boundary of the core
      gaspath and forming a continuous and smooth flow boundary surface between a
      gas path facing surface of the ring with a radially outer wall of the compressor.\\nKumar
      et al., which is also directed to a bleed valve translated into a gaspath of
      a compressor for extraction of foreign matter, disclose an annular wedge (24)
      having a gaspath facing surface to form a section of the radially outer annular
      wall when in its retracted position, the gaspath facing surface having an axial
      component and a radial component relative to the axis (Fig. 4), the actuated
      member closing an annular bleed off opening (26) directly at an outer flow boundary
      of the core gaspath (12, Figs. 3-4), and forming a continuous and smooth flow
      boundary surface between a gas path facing surface of the ring with a radially
      outer wall of the compressor (Fig. 4).\\n Pichel discloses a bleed valve that
      is translated into a gaspath of a compressor for extraction of foreign matter,
      however do not disclose the ring has a gaspath facing surface, which is set
      even with the radially outer annular wall to close the annular bleed off opening
      when the ring is in its retracted position so as to form with the radially outer
      wall a continuous flow boundary surface, the gaspath facing surface being inclined
      relative to the axis so as to have a radial component and an axial component
      relative to the axis. Kumar et al., which is also directed to a bleed valve
      translated into a gaspath of a compressor for extraction of foreign matter,
      disclose, in the retracted position, an annular wedge configured to close an
      annular bleed off opening directly at an outer flow boundary of a gaspath to
      provide a flush surface to improve the flow of gas when the valves is not being
      deployed. Thus, it would have been obvious to one having ordinary skill in the
      art before the effective filing of the claimed invention to modify the method
      of extracting water/hail particles and/or air from a core gaspath of a compressor
      of Pichel, by providing the actuated member with a gaspath facing surface to
      form a section of the radially outer annular wall when in its retracted position,
      the gaspath facing surface having an axial component and a radial component
      relative to the axis, the ring closing the annular bleed off opening directly
      at an outer flow boundary of the core gaspath and forming a continuous and smooth
      flow boundary surface between the gas path facing surface with a radially outer
      wall of the compressor, as taught by Kumar, to provide a flush surface to improve
      the flow of gas when the valve is not being deployed.\\nFurthermore, applicant's
      claimed invention only differs from the applied prior art by a mere substitution
      of the bleed valve structures, where both applicant\u2019s claimed elements,
      and that of the prior art, were both well known in the art before the effective
      filing date of the claimed invention.  One having ordinary skill in the art
      before the effective filing date of the claimed invention would have recognized
      that upon substitution of the bleed valve configuration of Kumar et al. that
      closes the opening at the radially outer wall and forms a continuous and smooth
      flow boundary for the bleed valve structure that is recessed from the radially
      outer wall, according to known methods, predictable results would have followed.
      \ Accordingly, it would have been obvious to one having ordinary skill in the
      art before the  effective filing date of the claimed invention to modify the
      applied prior art to include these taught limitations. \\n\\tIn regards to claim
      16, the modified method of Pichel comprises displacing the ring from the retracted
      positon to the deployed position comprises axially translating the ring in a
      forward direction away from the radially outer annular wall (Pichel Fig. 2).\\n\\tIn
      regards to claim 17, the modified method of Pichel comprises the ring has a
      bleed off opening facing surface (on divider projection Pichel 33), and wherein
      scooping comprises using the bleed off facing surface to deflect an incoming
      flow out of the core gaspath of the compressor (Pichel Fig. 2).\\n\\tIn regards
      to claim 19, the modified method of Pichel comprises centrifuging incoming water
      and hail particles upstream of the ring (Pichel par. 11).\\n\\tIn regards to
      claim 20, the modified method of Pichel wherein centrifuging comprises passing
      the incoming water and hail particles through a low pressure compressor stage
      (Pichel par. 11, Pichel Figs. 1-3).\\n Claims 3-5, 13-14 and 18 is/are rejected
      under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable over Pichel (US Patent Application
      2012/0288359) in view of Kumar et al. (US Patent 2015/0159560), and in further
      view of Pritchard et al. (US Patent Application 2014/0245747).\\nIn regards

      curved away from the radially inwardly converging direction (Figs. 2-9).\\n
      \\tPichel discloses a ramp that directs the inward flow into a radial direction,
      however does not disclose the ramp extending from a leading edge of the ring
      in an inward converging direction. Pritchard et al., which also is directed
      to bleed valves with ice extraction within a compressor, disclose a bleed valve
      with a ramp that includes an inward converging direction that utilizes a known
      configuration to capture large particles and amounts of particles (par. 7).
      Thus, it would have been obvious to one having ordinary skill in the art before
      the effective filing of the claimed invention to further modify the bleed off-valve
      and gas turbine engine of Pichel by providing the ramp extending from a leading
      edge in a radially inward converging direction, the ramp gradually curved away
      from the radially inwardly converging direction, as taught by Pritchard et al.,

      a bleed valve with a ramp that includes an inward converging direction that
      utilizes a known configuration to capture large particles and amounts of particles

      surface in sliding engagement with the corresponding annular seal. Boeck, which
      also is directed to bleed valves within a compressor, discloses a sliding seal
      that prevents tiltage and undesirable leakage (pars. 3-5). Thus, it would have
      been obvious to one having ordinary skill in the art before the effective filing
      of the claimed invention to further modify the bleed off-valve of Pichel by

      ACTION\\n\\tThis is responsive to the amendment filed on 11/9/2018. Claims 1-9
      and 11-20 are pending. The 112(a) rejection is being withdrawn due to the amendment.\\n\\nNotice
      of Pre-AIA  or AIA  Status\\nThe present application, filed on or after March
      16, 2013, is being examined under the first inventor to file provisions of the
      AIA .\\n\\nResponse to Arguments\\nApplicant's arguments filed 11/9/2018 have
      been fully considered but they are not persuasive. Applicant argues that projection
      33 of Pichel (US 2012/0288359) cannot possibly extend in both the axial and
      radial directions relative to the axis since it would not be able to move in
      and out of the annular slot (page 6, par. 2). In response to applicant's argument
      that the projection would not be able to move in and out of the slot with a
      gaspath facing surface, the test for obviousness is not whether the features
      of a secondary reference may be bodily incorporated into the structure of the
      primary reference; nor is it that the claimed invention must be expressly suggested
      in any one or all of the references.  Rather, the test is what the combined
      teachings of the references would have suggested to those of ordinary skill
      in the art.  See In re Keller, 642 F.2d 413, 208 USPQ 871 (CCPA 1981). Furthermore,
      the annular flow divider projection 33 \u201Cis designed as a flat ring\u201D
      (par. 27), and would have been able to be modified with a gaspath facing surface
      having a radial and axial component corresponding to the inlet opening 37 in
      view of teaching of Kumar (US 2015/0159560) which discloses a gaspath facing
      surface that covers the inlet opening 26 in the retracted position. \\nApplicant
      further argues that proposed modification would result in the ring moving in
      a non-axial direction which would change the principle of operation. The Examiner
      notes that the modified ring of Pichel would also move axially, and that the
      modification pertains to the ring having a gaspath facing surface not changing
      the actuation to move in a non-axial direction. Furthermore, the test for obviousness
      \ is not whether the features of a secondary reference may be bodily incorporated
      into the structure of the primary reference; nor is it that the claimed invention
      must be expressly suggested in any one or all of the references.  Rather, the
      test is what the combined teachings of the references would have suggested to
      those of ordinary skill in the art.  See In re Keller, 642 F.2d 413, 208 USPQ
      871 (CCPA 1981).\\nFurthermore, applicant is arguing that the fact that Pichel
      provides a dead space volume is evidence against the obviousness of providing
      a gaspath surface that is flush with a converging portion of the a radially
      outer wall. In this case, obviousness is supported by the simple substitution
      rationale provided in KSR, and also is supported by a general knowledge that
      providing a flush surface would improve flow through a passageway with a radially
      outer wall by eliminating pressure increasing discontinuity. In this case, Kumar
      clearly teaches an arrangement with the wedge being actuated to enter the flowpath
      in different directions and orientations with the wedge defining a continuous
      surface with radially outer wall (Figs. 3-8). Such a configuration could also
      be applied to the arrangement of Pichel to improve flow through the passageway.\\n\\nClaim
      Objections\\nClaim 17 is objected to because of the following informalities:
      \ it appears that \u201Cthe ring a bleed off opening facing surface\u201D should
      be changed to --the ring has a bleed off opening facing surface--.  Appropriate
      correction is required.\\n\\n\\nClaim Rejections - 35 USC \xA7 103\\nThe following
      is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 103 which forms the basis for all obviousness rejections
      set forth in this Office action:\\nA patent for a claimed invention may not
      be obtained, notwithstanding that the claimed invention is not identically disclosed
      as set forth in section 102, if the differences between the claimed invention
      and the prior art are such that the claimed invention as a whole would have
      been obvious before the effective filing date of the claimed invention to a
      person having ordinary skill in the art to which the claimed invention pertains.
      Patentability shall not be negated by the manner in which the invention was
      made.\\n\\nClaims 1-2, 6, 9, 11-12, 15-17 and 19-20 is/are rejected under 35
      U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable over Pichel (US Patent Application 2012/0288359)
      in view of Kumar et al. (US Patent 2015/0159560).\\nIn regards to claim 1, Pichel
      discloses a bleed off valve (BOV) for a gas turbine engine (10) having a gaspath
      bounded by a radially outer annular wall (31) extending about an axis (1) of
      the gas turbine engine, the radially outer annular wall having a converging
      portion (Fig. 2); the BOV comprising:\\na ring (32 including 33, par. 8) axially
      translatable between a retracted position (Fig. 3) in which the ring is configured
      to close an annular bleed off opening defined in the converging portion of the
      radially outer annular wall and a deployed position (Fig. 2) in which the ring
      (see divider projection 33) is configured to protrude into the gaspath (par.
      26), the ring having a gas path facing surface to form a section of the radially
      outer annular wall when in its retracted position (Fig. 3); and \\nan actuator
      operatively connected to the ring to axially translate the ring between the
      retracted and deployed positions (par. 26).\\nPichel does not disclose in the
      retracted position, the ring is configured to close the annular bleed off opening
      directly at an outer flow boundary of the gaspath and the gaspath facing surface
      of the ring forms a continuous and smooth flow boundary surface with the radially
      outer annular wall, the gaspath facing surface extending at an angle relative
      to the axis so as to have an axial component and a radial component.\\nKumar
      et al., which is also directed to a bleed valve translated into a gaspath of
      a compressor for extraction of foreign matter, disclose, in the retracted position,
      an annular wedge (24) configured to close an annular bleed off opening (26)
      directly at an outer flow boundary of a gaspath (12) and the gas path facing
      surface of the ring forms a continuous and smooth flow boundary surface with
      the radially outer annular wall, the gaspath facing surface extending at an
      angle relative to the axis so as to have an axial component and a radial component
      (Figs. 3-4).\\n Pichel discloses a bleed valve that is translated into a gaspath
      of a compressor for extraction of foreign matter, however do not disclose in
      the retracted position, the ring is configured to close the annular bleed off
      opening directly at an outer flow boundary of the gaspath and the gaspath facing
      surface of the ring forms a continuous and smooth flow boundary surface with
      the radially outer annular wall, the gaspath facing surface extending at an
      angle relative to the axis so as to have an axial component and a radial component.
      Kumar et al., which is also directed to a bleed valve translated into a gaspath
      of a compressor for extraction of foreign matter, disclose, in the retracted
      position, an annular wedge configured to close an annular bleed off opening
      directly at an outer flow boundary of a gaspath to provide a flush surface to
      improve the flow of gas when the valves is not being deployed. Thus, it would
      have been obvious to one having ordinary skill in the art before the effective
      filing of the claimed invention to modify the bleed off valve of Pichel, by
      providing in the retracted position, the actuated member is configured to close
      the annular bleed off opening directly at an outer flow boundary of the gaspath
      and the gaspath facing surface of the actuated member forms a continuous and
      smooth flow boundary surface with the radially outer annular wall, the gaspath
      facing surface extending at an angle relative to the axis so as to have an axial
      component and a radial component, as taught by Kumar, to provide a flush surface
      to improve the flow of gas when the valve is not being deployed.\\nFurthermore,
      applicant's claimed invention only differs from the applied prior art by a mere
      substitution of the bleed valve configuration, where both applicant\u2019s claimed
      elements, and that of the prior art, were both well known in the art before
      the effective filing date of the claimed invention.  One having ordinary skill
      in the art before the effective filing date of the claimed invention would have
      recognized that upon substitution of the bleed valve configuration that is continuous
      and smooth at the radially outer wall, according to known methods, predictable
      results would have followed.  Accordingly, it would have been obvious to one
      having ordinary skill in the art before the effective filing date of the claimed
      invention to modify the applied prior art to include these taught limitations.
      \\nIn regards to claim 2, the modified bleed off valve of Pichel comprises the
      ring has a bleed off opening facing surface, the bleed off opening facing surface
      configured to direct a radially inwardly  converging flow stream in the converging
      portion of the radially outer annular wall of the gaspath towards the bleed
      off opening (Pichel Fig. 2, Kumar Fig. 1). \\nIn regards to claim 6, the modified
      bleed off valve of Pichel comprises in the retracted position (Fig. 3), the
      ring mates with a corresponding annular seal (35, or 40) adapted to be mounted
      to the radially outer annular wall (Fig. 3).\\nIn regards to claim 9, Pichel
      discloses a gas turbine engine (10) comprising: \\na compressor having a gaspath
      bounded by a radially outer annular wall (31) extending about an axis of the
      engine, the radially outer annular wall having a converging portion; \\na bleed
      off valve (BOV) having a ring (32 including 33) axially translatable between
      a retracted position (Fig. 3) in which the ring closes an annular bleed off
      opening defined in the converging portion of the radially outer annular wall
      and a deployed position (Fig. 2) in which the ring (see divider projection 33)
      protrudes forwardly into the gaspath (Fig. 2, par. 26); and \\nan actuator operable
      to axially translate the ring between the retracted and the deployed positions
      (par. 26).\\nPichel does not disclose the ring has a gaspath facing surface,
      which is set even with the radially outer annular wall to close the annular
      bleed off opening when the ring is in its retracted position so as to form with
      the radially outer wall a continuous flow boundary surface, the gaspath facing
      surface being inclined relative to the axis so as to have a radial component
      and an axial component relative to the axis.\\nKumar et al., which is also directed
      to a bleed valve translated into a gaspath of a compressor for extraction of
      foreign matter, disclose an annular wedge (24) has a gaspath facing surface
      (Fig. 4), which is set even with the radially outer annular wall to close an
      annular bleed off opening when the wedge is in its retracted position so as
      to form with the radially outer wall a continuous flow boundary surface, the
      gaspath facing surface being inclined relative to the axis so as to have a radial
      component and an axial component relative to the axis (Fig. 4). \\nPichel discloses
      a bleed valve that is translated into a gaspath of a compressor for extraction
      of foreign matter, however do not disclose the ring has a gaspath facing surface,
      which is set even with the  radially outer annular wall to close the annular

      to close an annular bleed off opening directly at an outer flow boundary of
      a gaspath to provide a flush surface to improve the flow of gas when the valves
      is not being deployed. Thus, it would have been obvious to one having ordinary
      skill in the art before the effective filing of the claimed invention to modify
      the gas turbine of Pichel, by providing the actuated member with a gaspath facing
      surface, which is set even with the radially outer annular wall to close the
      annular bleed off opening when the actuated member is in its retracted position
      so as to form with the radially outer wall a continuous flow boundary surface,

      is not being deployed.\\nFurthermore, applicant's claimed invention only differs
      from the applied prior art by a mere substitution of the bleed valve configuration,
      where both applicant\u2019s claimed elements, and that of the prior art, were
      both well known in the art before the effective filing date of the claimed invention.
      \ One having ordinary skill in the art before the effective filing date of the
      claimed invention would have recognized that upon substitution of the bleed
      valve closing the opening even with the radially outer wall of Kumar et al.
      for the bleed valve recessed from the radially outer wall, according to known
      methods, predictable results would have followed.  Accordingly, it would have
      been obvious to one having ordinary skill in the art before the effective filing
      date of the claimed invention to modify the applied prior art to include these
      taught limitations. \\nIn regards to claim 11, the modified gas turbine engine
      of Pichel comprises the BOV is disposed in a compressor section downstream of
      a compressor rotor (Pichel Figs. 2-3).\\n In regards to claim 12, the modified
      gas turbine engine of Pichel comprises the ring has a bleed off opening facing
      surface (on divider projection 33) opposite to said gaspath facing surface thereof,
      the bleed off facing surface being configured to redirect an incoming flow through
      the annular bleed off opening (Pichel Fig. 2, Kumar Figs. 3-4).\\nIn regards
      to claim 15, Pichel discloses a method of extracting water/hail (pars. 11, 14,
      30) and/or air (via duct 30) from a core gas path of a compressor of a gas turbine
      engine (10), the compressor rotatable about an axis, the method comprising:\\n\\tdisplacing
      axially a ring (32 including 33) from a retracted position (Fig. 3) in which
      the ring closes a corresponding annular bleed off opening defined in a converging
      portion of a radially outer annular wall (31) of the core gaspath to a deployed
      position (Fig. 2) in which the ring (see divider projection 33) protrudes axially
      forwardly into the core gaspath to scoop water/hail particles and/or air out
      of the core gaspath via the annular bleed off opening (Fig. 2, par. 26).\\nPichel
      et al. do not disclose the ring having a gaspath facing surface to form a section
      of the radially outer annular wall when in its retracted position, the gaspath
      facing surface having an axial component and a radial component relative to
      the axis, the ring closing the annular bleed off opening directly at an outer
      flow boundary of the core gaspath and forming a continuous and smooth flow boundary
      surface between a gas path facing surface of the ring with a radially outer
      wall of the compressor.\\nKumar et al., which is also directed to a bleed valve
      translated into a gaspath of a compressor for extraction of foreign matter,
      disclose an annular wedge (24) having a gaspath facing surface to form a section
      of the radially outer annular wall when in its retracted position, the gaspath
      facing surface having an axial component and a radial component relative to
      the axis (Fig. 4), the actuated member closing an annular bleed off opening
      (26) directly at an outer flow boundary of the core gaspath (12, Figs. 3-4),
      and forming a continuous and smooth flow boundary surface between a gas path
      facing surface of the ring with a radially outer wall of the compressor (Fig.
      4).\\n Pichel discloses a bleed valve that is translated into a gaspath of a
      compressor for extraction of foreign matter, however do not disclose the ring

      wall to close the annular bleed off opening when the ring is in its retracted
      position so as to form with the radially outer wall a continuous flow boundary
      surface, the gaspath facing surface being inclined relative to the axis so as
      to have a radial component and an axial component relative to the axis. Kumar
      et al., which is also directed to a bleed valve translated into a gaspath of
      a compressor for extraction of foreign matter, disclose, in the retracted position,
      an annular wedge configured to close an annular bleed off opening directly at
      an outer flow boundary of a gaspath to provide a flush surface to improve the
      flow of gas when the valves is not being deployed. Thus, it would have been
      obvious to one having ordinary skill in the art before the effective filing
      of the claimed invention to modify the method of extracting water/hail particles
      and/or air from a core gaspath of a compressor of Pichel, by providing the actuated
      member with a gaspath facing surface to form a section of the radially outer
      annular wall when in its retracted position, the gaspath facing surface having
      an axial component and a radial component relative to the axis, the ring closing

      gaspath and forming a continuous and smooth flow boundary surface between the
      gas path facing surface with a radially outer wall of the compressor, as taught
      by Kumar, to provide a flush surface to improve the flow of gas when the valve
      is not being deployed.\\nFurthermore, applicant's claimed invention only differs
      from the applied prior art by a mere substitution of the bleed valve structures,
      where both applicant\u2019s claimed elements, and that of the prior art, were
      both well known in the art before the effective filing date of the claimed invention.

      outer wall and forms a continuous and smooth flow boundary for the bleed valve
      structure that is recessed from the radially outer wall, according to known
      methods, predictable results would have followed.  Accordingly, it would have
      been obvious to one having ordinary skill in the art before the  effective filing
      date of the claimed invention to modify the applied prior art to include these
      taught limitations. \\n\\tIn regards to claim 16, the modified method of Pichel
      comprises displacing the ring from the retracted positon to the deployed position
      comprises axially translating the ring in a forward direction away from the
      radially outer annular wall (Pichel Fig. 2).\\n\\tIn regards to claim 17, the
      modified method of Pichel comprises the ring has a bleed off opening facing
      surface (on divider projection Pichel 33), and wherein scooping comprises using
      the bleed off facing surface to deflect an incoming flow out of the core gaspath

      of the ring (Pichel par. 11).\\n\\tIn regards to claim 20, the modified method
      of Pichel wherein centrifuging comprises passing the incoming water and hail
      particles through a low pressure compressor stage (Pichel par. 11, Pichel Figs.
      1-3).\\n\\nClaims 3-5, 13-14 and 18 is/are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being
      unpatentable over Pichel (US Patent Application 2012/0288359) in view of Kumar
      et al. (US Patent 2015/0159560), and in further view of Pritchard et al. (US
      Patent Application 2014/0245747).\\nIn regards to claims 3, 5 and 13, the modified
      BOV and gas turbine engine of Pichel comprises the bleed off opening facing
      surface defines a ramp with the ramp gradually curving in an outward direction.\\n\\tThe
      modified BOV and gas turbine engine of Pichel lacks the ramp extending from
      a leading edge of the ring in a radially inward converging direction, the ramp
      gradually curved away from the radially inwardly converging direction.\\n\\tPritchard
      et al. disclose a bleed apparatus for ice extraction with a ramp (door 50, scoop
      60) extending from a leading edge (51) of the ramp in a radially inward converging
      direction, the ramp gradually curved away from the radially inwardly converging
      direction (Figs. 2-9).\\n \\tPichel discloses a ramp that directs the inward
      flow into a radial direction, however does not disclose the ramp extending from
      a leading edge of the ring in an inward converging direction. Pritchard et al.,
      which also is directed to bleed valves with ice extraction within a compressor,
      disclose a bleed valve with a ramp that includes an inward converging direction
      that utilizes a known configuration to capture large particles and amounts of
      particles (par. 7). Thus, it would have been obvious to one having ordinary
      skill in the art before the effective filing of the claimed invention to further
      modify the bleed off-valve and gas turbine engine of Pichel by providing the
      ramp extending from a leading edge in a radially inward converging direction,
      the ramp gradually curved away from the radially inwardly converging direction,
      as taught by Pritchard et al., such that the ramp extends from a leading edge
      of the ring, to utilize a known configuration to capture large particles and
      amounts of particles (par. 7).\\n\\tIn regards to claims 4 and 14, the modified
      BOV and gas turbine engine of Pichel comprises the ramp curves from the radially
      inwardly converging direction to a radially outward direction (Pritchard et
      al. Figs. 2-9).\\n\\tIn regards to claim 18, the modified method of Pichel comprises
      deflecting comprises guiding the incoming flow along the bleed off opening facing
      surface of the ring to a radially outward direction (Fig. 2).\\n\\tThe modified
      method of Pichel lacks deflecting comprises guiding the incoming flow along
      the bleed off opening facing surface from a radially inward direction.\\n\\tPritchard
      et al. disclose a bleed apparatus for ice extraction with a ramp (door 50, scoop
      60) guiding the incoming flow along the bleed off opening facing surface from
      a radially inward direction to a generally outward direction (Figs. 2-9).\\n\\tPichel
      discloses a ramp that directs the inward flow into an outward radial direction,
      however do not disclose the ramp extending in an inward converging direction.
      Pritchard et al., which also is directed to bleed valves with ice extraction
      within a compressor, disclose a bleed valve with a ramp that includes an inward
      converging direction that utilizes a known configuration to capture large particles
      and amounts of particles (par. 7). Thus, it would have been obvious to one having
      ordinary skill in the art before the number='10'effective filing of the claimed
      invention to further modify the method of extracting water/hail particles of
      Pichel by deflecting comprises guiding the incoming flow along the bleed off
      opening facing surface from a generally radially inward direction, as taught
      by Pritchard et al., to utilize a known configuration to capture large particles
      and amounts of particles (par. 7).\\n\\nClaims 7-8 is/are also rejected under
      35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable over Pichel (US Patent Application 2012/0288359)
      in view of Kumar et al. (US Patent 2015/0159560), and in view of Boeck (DE 19834530
      A1, see English translation).\\n\\tIn regards to claim 7, the modified BOV of
      Pichel contains all of the claimed elements as set forth in the rejection of
      claim 6, except the ring has a radial sealing surface in sliding engagement
      with the corresponding annular seal.\\n\\tBoeck discloses a ring for a bleed
      valve in a compressor of a gas turbine engine with a radial sealing surface
      (2b) in sliding engagement with a corresponding annular seal (9) mounted to
      the radially outer annular wall of the compressor (Fig. 1)\\n\\tPichel discloses
      a bleed valve with sealing surfaces on the radially outer wall, however do not
      explicitly disclose the ring has a radial sealing surface in sliding engagement
      with the corresponding annular seal. Boeck, which also is directed to bleed
      valves within a compressor, discloses a sliding seal that prevents tiltage and
      undesirable leakage (pars. 3-5). Thus, it would have been obvious to one having
      ordinary skill in the art before the effective filing of the claimed invention
      to further modify the bleed off-valve of Pichel by providing the ring has a
      radial sealing surface in sliding engagement with the corresponding annular
      seal, as taught by Boeck, to prevent tilting and undesirable leakages (pars.
      3-5, 19).\\n\\tIn regards to claim 8, the modfied BOV of Pichel contains all
      of the claimed elements as set forth in the rejection of claim 6, except the
      annular seal is an axial compression seal.\\n\\tBoeck discloses a ring for a
      bleed valve in a compressor of a gas turbine engine with an annular seal (10)
      is an axial compression seal (see bellows pars. 18, 20, abstract flexible seal).\\nnumber='11'\\tPichel
      discloses a bleed valve with an axial seal, however do not explicitly disclose
      the annular seal is an axial compression seal. Boeck, which also is directed
      to bleed valves within a compressor, discloses a flexible seal member that provides
      axial tolerances to ensure a seal (par. 20). Thus, it would have been obvious
      to one having ordinary skill in the art before the effective filing of the claimed
      invention to further modify the bleed off-valve of Pichel by providing the annular
      seal is an axial compression seal, as taught by Boeck, to provide axial tolerances
      to ensure a seal (par. 20).\\n\\nConclusion\\nTHIS ACTION IS MADE FINAL.  Applicant

      of the \u201Csame invention\u201D type finds its support in the language of
      35 U.S.C. 101 which states that \u201Cwhoever invents or discovers any new and
      useful process... may obtain a patent therefor...\u201D (Emphasis added). Thus,
      the term \u201Csame invention,\u201D in this context, means an invention drawn
      to identical subject matter. See Miller v. Eagle Mfg. Co., 151 U.S. 186 (1894);
      In re Vogel, 422 F.2d 438, 164 USPQ 619 (CCPA 1970); In re Ockert, 245 F.2d
      467, 114 USPQ 330 (CCPA 1957).\\nA statutory type (35 U.S.C. 101) double patenting
      rejection can be overcome by canceling or amending the claims that are directed
      to the same invention so they are no longer coextensive in scope. The filing
      of a terminal disclaimer cannot overcome a double patenting rejection based
      upon 35 U.S.C. 101.\\nClaims 1-28 is/are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 101 as claiming
      the same invention as that of claims 29-30, 35, 37-38, 40-47, 52, 54-60 of prior
      U.S. Patent No. 9695356. This is a statutory double patenting rejection.\\nConclusion\\nAny

      nip with respect to a feeding direction of the recording material gradually
      increases from a longitudinal central portion toward a longitudinal end portion
      [0087] and (ii) a pressure of the nip gradually increases from the longitudinal
      central portion toward the longitudinal end portion [0079]. \\nIt would have
      been obvious to one having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention
      was filed to modify the apparatus as disclosed by Imaizumi et al. to include
      wherein the nip includes a region at which (i) a width of the nip with respect
      to a feeding direction of the recording material gradually increases from a

      ACTION\\n\\nNotice of Pre-AIA  or AIA  Status\\nThe present application, filed
      on or after March 16, 2013, is being examined under the first inventor to file
      provisions of the AIA .\\nIn the event the determination of the status of the
      application as subject to AIA  35 U.S.C. 102 and 103 (or as subject to pre-AIA
      \ 35 U.S.C. 102 and 103) is incorrect, any correction of the statutory basis
      for the rejection will not be considered a new ground of rejection if the prior
      art relied upon, and the rationale supporting the rejection, would be the same
      under either status.  \\n\\nContinued Examination Under 37 CFR 1.114\\nA request
      for continued examination under 37 CFR 1.114, including the fee set forth in
      37 CFR 1.17(e), was filed in this application after final rejection.  Since
      this application is eligible for continued examination under 37 CFR 1.114, and
      the fee set forth in 37 CFR 1.17(e) has been timely paid, the finality of the
      previous Office action has been withdrawn pursuant to 37 CFR 1.114.  Applicant's
      submission filed on 7/5/18 has been entered.\\n \\nDrawings\\nThe drawings are
      objected to under 37 CFR 1.83(a).  The drawings must show every feature of the
      invention specified in the claims.  Therefore, the \u201Cwherein said pressing
      member is a roller including a region at which an outer diameter of said roller
      gradually increases from a longitudinal central portion toward a longitudinal
      end portion of said roller\u201D of claim 5 must be shown or the feature(s)
      canceled from the claim(s).  No new matter should be entered.\\n Corrected drawing
      sheets in compliance with 37 CFR 1.121(d) are required in reply to the Office
      action to avoid abandonment of the application. Any amended replacement drawing
      sheet should include all of the figures appearing on the immediate prior version
      of the sheet, even if only one figure is being amended. The figure or figure
      number of an amended drawing should not be labeled as \u201Camended.\u201D If
      a drawing figure is to be canceled, the appropriate figure must be removed from
      the replacement sheet, and where necessary, the remaining figures must be renumbered
      and appropriate changes made to the brief description of the several views of
      the drawings for consistency. Additional replacement sheets may be necessary
      to show the renumbering of the remaining figures. Each drawing sheet submitted
      after the filing date of an application must be labeled in the top margin as
      either \u201CReplacement Sheet\u201D or \u201CNew Sheet\u201D pursuant to 37
      CFR 1.121(d). If the changes are not accepted by the examiner, the applicant
      will be notified and informed of any required corrective action in the next
      Office action. The objection to the drawings will not be held in abeyance.\\n\\nDouble
      Patenting\\nThe nonstatutory double patenting rejection is based on a judicially
      created doctrine grounded in public policy (a policy reflected in the statute)
      so as to prevent the unjustified or improper timewise extension of the \u201Cright
      to exclude\u201D granted by a patent and to prevent possible harassment by multiple
      assignees. A nonstatutory double patenting rejection is appropriate where the
      conflicting claims are not identical, but at least one examined application
      claim is not patentably distinct from the reference claim(s) because the examined
      application claim is either anticipated by, or would have been obvious over,
      the reference claim(s). See, e.g., In re Berg, 140 F.3d 1428, 46 USPQ2d 1226
      (Fed. Cir. 1998); In re Goodman, 11 F.3d 1046, 29 USPQ2d 2010 (Fed. Cir. 1993);
      In re Longi, 759 F.2d 887, 225 USPQ 645 (Fed. Cir. 1985); In re Van Ornum, 686
      F.2d 937, 214 USPQ 761 (CCPA 1982); In re Vogel, 422 F.2d 438, 164 USPQ 619
      (CCPA 1970); In re Thorington, 418 F.2d 528, 163 USPQ 644 (CCPA 1969).\\n A
      timely filed terminal disclaimer in compliance with 37 CFR 1.321(c) or 1.321(d)
      may be used to overcome an actual or provisional rejection based on nonstatutory
      double patenting provided the reference application or patent either is shown
      to be commonly owned with the examined application, or claims an invention made
      as a result of activities undertaken within the scope of a joint research agreement.
      See MPEP \xA7 717.02 for applications subject to examination under the first
      inventor to file provisions of the AIA  as explained in MPEP \xA7 2159.  See
      MPEP \xA7\xA7 706.02(l)(1) - 706.02(l)(3) for applications not subject to examination
      under the first inventor to file provisions of the AIA . A terminal disclaimer

      would have been obvious to one having ordinary skill in the art at the time
      the invention was filed to further modify claims 2 and 3 of U.S. Patent No.
      9,766,578 to include wherein said heat-conductive member is divided into plural
      members and wherein each of said plural members includes a said regulating portion,
      respectively in order to suppress warpage and restrict longitudinal movement
      [0043] (Ogawa et al.).\\n\\nClaim Rejections - 35 USC \xA7 103\\nThe following
      is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 103 which forms the basis for all obviousness rejections
      set forth in this Office action:\\nA patent for a claimed invention may not
      be obtained, notwithstanding that the claimed invention is not identically disclosed
      as set forth in section 102, if the differences between the claimed invention
      and the prior art are such that the claimed invention as a whole would have
      been obvious before the effective filing date of the claimed invention to a
      person having ordinary skill in the art to which the claimed invention pertains.
      Patentability shall not be negated by the manner in which the invention was
      made.\\n\\nClaims 1, 2, 4, and 5 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable
      over Imaizumi et al. US 20140186078 in view of Adachi et al. US 20140153982.\\nRegarding

      of Adachi et al. US 20140153982 and further in view of Ogawa et al. US 20160098001.\\nRegarding
      claim 3, Imaizumi et al. in view of Adachi et al. teaches the limitations of
      claim 1 as set forth above, but does not explicitly teach wherein said heat-conductive
      member is divided into plural members. \\nOgawa et al. discloses wherein said
      heat-conductive member is divided into plural members (300a and 300b) (FIG.
      4). \\nIt would have been obvious to one having ordinary skill in the art at

      [0043] (Ogawa et al.) (disclosing that the metal plates 300a and 300b each include
      bent portions).\\n\\nResponse to Arguments\\nThe previous objection to claim
      11 is withdrawn in light of applicant\u2019s amendments.\\nApplicant's arguments
      filed 6/5/18 have been fully considered but they are not persuasive.\\nRegarding
      the objection to the drawings, applicant argues that the feature of claim 5
      is obvious in view of Figure 6 and the specification (see page 8 of applicant\u2019s
      arguments). However, as set forth above, the drawings must show every feature
      of the invention specified in the claims.\\nRegarding claim 1, applicant argues
      that Adachi et al. does not disclose wherein a pressure of the nip gradually
      increases from the longitudinal central portion toward the longitudinal end
      portion (see page 11). However, [0079] of Adachi et al. discloses that, in order
      to prevent creasing, the recording medium is conveyed through the nip at each
      longitudinal end at a speed higher than at the longitudinal central portion
      due to the pressure of the nip gradually increasing from the longitudinal central
      portion toward the longitudinal end portion. \\n\\nConclusion\\nAny inquiry

      and 19]  an electrical connecting apparatus, comprising: a supporting body (stage
      13) having a lower surface [shown but not numbered]; a plurality of contacts
      (wafer 5 and plate 36 or 21 [Fig. 19]) arranged on said supporting body (13);
      a mark (mark 37x or 22 [Fig. 19]) that is provided on said supporting body (13)

      19]) provided in said supporting body (13) to irradiate said mark (37x or 22)
      with incident light (light IL2) from a lower side of said mark (37x or 22);
      wherein [see Note below] the differences between incident light transmitted
      from the light source (23 or 123-126) through said mark (37x or 22) and light
      transmitted from the light source (23 or 123-126) through said area adjacent
      [via 36 and 21] to said mark (37x or 22) are detected [via photoelectric device

      arranged on said lower surface of said supporting body\u201D as claimed. It
      is well known to have items located on different parts of a device where needed.
      [See MPEP 2144.04 In re Kuhle, 526 F.2d 553, 188 USPQ 7 (CCPA 1975)]. It would
      have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the

      modified the operation of the device.\\n [Note: Claim limitations that employ
      phrases of the type \u201Cwherein\u201D are typical of claim limitations, which
      may not distinguish over the prior art. It has been held that the recitation

      or 123-126) is arranged in said recess.\\nRegarding claim 9, Irie et al disclose
      said mark (37x) includes an area (dot pattern 44) [see Fig. 15A] that permits
      passing of light from said light source (23), and said adjacent area (36) permits

      of light [area outside of pattern 44 in Fig. 15A] from said light source (23),
      and said adjacent area (36) permits passing of light from said light source
      (23).\\nRegarding claim 11, Irie et al disclose said mark (37x) is located at
      a position in proximity to said contacts (36 and 5) at which said contacts (36
      and 5) are not located.\\nRegarding claim 12, Irie et al disclose said mark
      (37x) is formed in a sheet-like mark member [see col. 14, lines 3-4] arranged
      on said supporting body (13). However, the prior art does not disclose \u201Cmark
      arranged on said lower surface of said supporting body\u201D as claimed. It
      is well known to have items located on different parts of a device where needed.

      passing feature differs from that of an area [via plate 36 or 21(Fig. 19)] on
      the supporting body (13) adjacent to said mark (37x or 22); and a light source

      the mark (37x or 22), the portion of the light (IL2) transmitted through the
      mark (37X or 22) being detectable [via photoelectric device 41 or 29(Fig. 19)]
      when the supporting body (13) is in a particular position. However, the prior
      art does not disclose \u201Ccontacts arranged on said lower surface of said
      supporting body\u201D as claimed. It is well known to have items located on
      different parts of a device where needed. [See MPEP 2144.04 In re Kuhle, 526
      F.2d 553, 188 USPQ 7 (CCPA 1975)]. It would have been obvious to a person having

      device.\\n[Note: Claim limitations that employ phrases of the type \u201Coperable
      to\u201D are typical of claim limitations, which may not distinguish over the
      prior art. It has been held that the recitation that an element is \u201Coperable
      to\u201D perform a function is not a positive limitation but only requires the
      ability to so perform. See also MPEP 2111.04]\\n Regarding claim 16, Irie et
      al disclose an alignment mark (dot pattern 44) [Fig. 15A] has a circular shape
      [see Fig. 15A], the area around the alignment mark (44) is an annular area,
      and the mark member has a rectangular shape.\\nRegarding claim 19, Irie et al
      disclose [see Figs. 14 and 19]  an electrical connecting apparatus, comprising:
      a supporting body (stage 13) having a lower surface [shown but not numbered];
      a plurality of contacts (wafer 5 and plate 36 or 21 [Fig. 19]) arranged on said
      supporting body (13); a mark (mark 37x or 22 [Fig. 19]) that is provided on
      said supporting body (13) [via plate 36 and 21(fig. 19)] , the mark (37x or
      22) having light passing feature differs from that of an area [via plate 36
      or 21(Fig. 19)] on the supporting body (13) adjacent to said mark (37x or 22);
      and a light source (optical fiber 23 or illumination system 123-126 [Fig. 19])
      provided in said supporting body (13), the light source (23 or 123-126) operable
      to [see Note below] to irradiate said mark (37x or 22) with light (light IL2)
      from a lower side of said mark (37x or 22) and a portion of the light being
      transmitted through the mark (37x or 22), a detection unit (optical system 3)
      movable in relation to the supporting body (13), the detection unit (3) operable
      to [see Note below] detect the portion of the incident light transmitted through
      the mark (37x or 22) and to determine a position of the supporting body (13)
      responsive to the portion of incident light transmitted through the mark (37x
      or 22). However, the prior art does not disclose \u201Ccontacts arranged on
      said lower surface of said supporting body\u201D as claimed. It is well known
      to have items located on different parts of a device where needed. [See MPEP
      2144.04 In re Kuhle, 526 F.2d 553, 188 USPQ 7 (CCPA 1975)]. It would have been
      obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention
      was made to have plurality of contacts arranged on the lower or upper surface
      of said supporting body since the particular placement of said  contacts on
      the body is held to be obvious matter of design choice and it would not have
      modified the operation of the device.\\n[Note: Claim limitations that employ

      claim 20, Irie et al disclose the mark (37x) includes an alignment mark (44)
      having a first optical characteristic and an area surrounding the alignment
      mark (44) having a second optical characteristic that enables the detection
      unit (3) to distinguish the portion of incident light transmitted through the

      \ In considering patentability of the claims under 35 U.S.C. 103(a), the examiner
      presumes that the subject matter of the various claims was commonly owned at
      the time any inventions covered therein were made absent any evidence to the
      contrary.  Applicant is advised of the obligation under 37 CFR 1.56 to point
      out the inventor and invention dates of each claim that was not commonly owned
      at the time a later invention was made in order for the examiner to consider
      the applicability of 35 U.S.C. 103(c) and potential 35 U.S.C. 102(e), (f) or
      (g) prior art under 35 U.S.C. 103(a). \\nClaims 1-2, 9-12, 14, 16 and 19-20
      are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Irie et al (6118516).\\nRegarding
      claim 1, Irie et al disclose [see Figs. 14 and 19]  an electrical connecting
      apparatus, comprising: a supporting body (stage 13) having a lower surface [shown
      but not numbered]; a plurality of contacts (wafer 5 and plate 36 or 21 [Fig.
      19]) arranged on said supporting body (13); a mark (mark 37x or 22 [Fig. 19])
      that is provided on said supporting body (13) [via plate 36 and 21(fig. 19)]
      and whose light passing feature differs from that of an area adjacent [via plate
      36 or 21(Fig. 19)] to said mark (37x or 22); and a light source (optical fiber
      23 or illumination system 123-126 [Fig. 19]) provided in said supporting body
      (13) to irradiate said mark (37x or 22) with incident light (light IL2) from
      a lower side of said mark (37x or 22); wherein [see Note below] the differences
      between incident light transmitted from the light source (23 or 123-126) through
      said mark (37x or 22) and light transmitted from the light source (23 or 123-126)
      through said area adjacent [via 36 and 21] to said mark (37x or 22) are detected
      [via photoelectric device 41 or 29 (Fig. 19)]. However, the prior art does not
      disclose \u201Ccontacts arranged on said lower surface of said supporting body\u201D
      as claimed. It is well known to have items located on different parts of a device
      where needed. [See MPEP 2144.04 In re Kuhle, 526 F.2d 553, 188 USPQ 7 (CCPA
      1975)]. It would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the
      art at the time the invention was made to have plurality of contacts arranged
      on the lower or upper surface of said supporting body since the particular placement
      of said contacts on the body is held to be obvious matter of design choice and
      it would not have modified the operation of the device.\\n [Note: Claim limitations
      that employ phrases of the type \u201Cwherein\u201D are typical of claim limitations,
      which may not distinguish over the prior art. It has been held that the recitation
      that \u201Cwherein\u201D an element is performing a  function does not limit
      a claim to a particular structure which does not limit the scope of a claim
      or claim limitation. See also MPEP 2111.04]\\nRegarding claim 2, Irie et al
      disclose said supporting body (13) has a recess opened [shown but not numbered
      in Figs. 14 ad 19] toward said mark (37x or 22), and said light source (123
      or 123-126) is arranged in said recess.\\nRegarding claim 9, Irie et al disclose
      said mark (37x) includes an area (dot pattern 44) [see Fig. 15A] that permits
      passing of light from said light source (23), and said adjacent area (36) permits
      passing of light from said light source (23). \\nRegarding claim 10, Irie et
      al disclose said mark (37x) includes an area that restricts or blocks passing
      of light [area outside of pattern 44 in Fig. 15A] from said light source (23),
      and said adjacent area (36) permits passing of light from said light source
      (23).\\nRegarding claim 11, Irie et al disclose said mark (37x) is located at
      a position in proximity to said contacts (36 and 5) at which said contacts (36
      and 5) are not located.\\nRegarding claim 12, Irie et al disclose said mark
      (37x) is formed in a sheet-like mark member [see col. 14, lines 3-4] arranged
      on said supporting body (13). However, the prior art does not disclose \u201Cmark
      arranged on said lower surface of said supporting body\u201D as claimed. It
      is well known to have items located on different parts of a device where needed.
      [See MPEP 2144.04 In re Kuhle, 526 F.2d 553, 188 USPQ 7 (CCPA 1975)]. It would
      have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the
      invention was made to have a mark arranged on the lower or upper surface of
      said supporting body since the particular placement of said mark on the body
      is held to be obvious matter of design choice and it would not have modified
      the operation of the device.\\n Regarding claim 14, Irie et al disclose [see
      Figs. 14 and 19]  an electrical connecting apparatus, comprising: a supporting
      body (stage 13) having a lower surface [shown but not numbered]; a plurality
      of contacts (wafer 5 and plate 36 or 21 [Fig. 19]) arranged on said supporting
      body (13); a mark (mark 37x or 22 [Fig. 19]) that is provided on said supporting
      body (13) [via plate 36 and 21(fig. 19)] , the mark (37x or 22) having light
      passing feature differs from that of an area [via plate 36 or 21(Fig. 19)] on
      the supporting body (13) adjacent to said mark (37x or 22); and a light source
      (optical fiber 23 or illumination system 123-126 [Fig. 19]) provided in said
      supporting body (13), the light source (23 or 123-126) operable to [see Note
      below] to irradiate said mark (37x or 22) with light (light IL2) from a lower
      side of said mark (37x or 22) and a portion of the light being transmitted through
      the mark (37x or 22), the portion of the light (IL2) transmitted through the
      mark (37X or 22) being detectable [via photoelectric device 41 or 29(Fig. 19)]
      when the supporting body (13) is in a particular position. However, the prior
      art does not disclose \u201Ccontacts arranged on said lower surface of said
      supporting body\u201D as claimed. It is well known to have items located on
      different parts of a device where needed. [See MPEP 2144.04 In re Kuhle, 526
      F.2d 553, 188 USPQ 7 (CCPA 1975)]. It would have been obvious to a person having
      ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to have plurality
      of contacts arranged on the lower or upper surface of said supporting body since
      the particular placement of said contacts on the body is held to be obvious
      matter of design choice and it would not have modified the operation of the
      device.\\n[Note: Claim limitations that employ phrases of the type \u201Coperable
      to\u201D are typical of claim limitations, which may not distinguish over the
      prior art. It has been held that the recitation that an element is \u201Coperable
      to\u201D perform a function is not a positive limitation but only requires the
      ability to so perform. See also MPEP 2111.04]\\n Regarding claim 16, Irie et
      al disclose an alignment mark (dot pattern 44) [Fig. 15A] has a circular shape
      [see Fig. 15A], the area around the alignment mark (44) is an annular area,
      and the mark member has a rectangular shape.\\nRegarding claim 19, Irie et al
      disclose [see Figs. 14 and 19]  an electrical connecting apparatus, comprising:
      a supporting body (stage 13) having a lower surface [shown but not numbered];
      a plurality of contacts (wafer 5 and plate 36 or 21 [Fig. 19]) arranged on said
      supporting body (13); a mark (mark 37x or 22 [Fig. 19]) that is provided on
      said supporting body (13) [via plate 36 and 21(fig. 19)] , the mark (37x or
      22) having light passing feature differs from that of an area [via plate 36
      or 21(Fig. 19)] on the supporting body (13) adjacent to said mark (37x or 22);
      and a light source (optical fiber 23 or illumination system 123-126 [Fig. 19])
      provided in said supporting body (13), the light source (23 or 123-126) operable
      to [see Note below] to irradiate said mark (37x or 22) with light (light IL2)
      from a lower side of said mark (37x or 22) and a portion of the light being
      transmitted through the mark (37x or 22), a detection unit (optical system 3)
      movable in relation to the supporting body (13), the detection unit (3) operable
      to [see Note below] detect the portion of the incident light transmitted through
      the mark (37x or 22) and to determine a position of the supporting body (13)
      responsive to the portion of incident light transmitted through the mark (37x
      or 22). However, the prior art does not disclose \u201Ccontacts arranged on
      said lower surface of said supporting body\u201D as claimed. It is well known
      to have items located on different parts of a device where needed. [See MPEP
      2144.04 In re Kuhle, 526 F.2d 553, 188 USPQ 7 (CCPA 1975)]. It would have been
      obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention
      was made to have plurality of contacts arranged on the lower or upper surface
      of said supporting body since the particular placement of said  contacts on
      the body is held to be obvious matter of design choice and it would not have
      modified the operation of the device.\\n[Note: Claim limitations that employ

      claim 20, Irie et al disclose the mark (37x) includes an alignment mark (44)
      having a first optical characteristic and an area surrounding the alignment
      mark (44) having a second optical characteristic that enables the detection
      unit (3) to distinguish the portion of incident light transmitted through the
      alignment mark (44) from the portion of incident light transmitted through the
      area surrounding the alignment mark (44).\\nConclusion\\nThe prior art made
      of record and not relied upon is considered pertinent to applicant's disclosure.
      See PTO-892 for details.\\nClaims 3-8, 15 and 17-18 are objected to as being
      dependent upon a rejected base claim, but would be allowable if rewritten in
      independent form including all of the limitations of the base claim and any
      intervening claims.\\nThe following is a statement of reasons for the indication
      of allowable subject matter: regarding claims 3-8, the reason for the allowance
      was presented in the Office Action mailed on January 10, 2013.\\nRegarding claim
      15, the primary reason for the allowance of the claim is due to, in combination
      with other limitations, the mark comprises an alignment mark positioned in a
      center of the mark and operable to block the light from the light source.\\n
      Regarding claim 17, the primary reason for the allowance of the claim is due
      to the alignment mark is operable to block substantially all light from the
      light source that irradiates the upper side of the alignment mark. Since claim
      18 depends from claim 17, it also has allowable subject matter.\\nAny inquiry

      are allowed.\\nREASONS FOR ALLOWANCE\\nThe following is an examiner\u2019s statement
      of reasons for allowance: The prior art of record fails to teach or fairly suggest
      a stripping structure for stripping ends of a plurality of leads of a lead bundle
      where the stripping structure comprises a cover fulfilling these requirements:
      \  a) the cover is coupled to an open end of the housing so as to substantially
      close the open end, b) the cover has an opening constructed and arranged to
      receive an end of the lead bundle, at least a portion of the opening positioned
      upstream of the stripping chamber so that the leads are received through the
      opening and into the stripping chamber and c) the cover is made entirely of
      flexible material and is constructed and arranged to seal about the lead bundle
      when it is received through the opening, to prevent the stripping solution from
      exiting the opening, and d) the cover defined an interior space in communication
      with the stripping chamber as recited in claims 1 and 10.\\nAny comments considered
      necessary by applicant must be submitted no later than the payment of the issue
      fee and, to avoid processing delays, should preferably accompany the issue fee.

      \ The claim(s) contains subject matter which was not described in the specification
      in such a way as to reasonably convey to one skilled in the relevant art that
      the inventor or a joint inventor, or for pre-AIA  the inventor(s), at the time
      the application was filed, had possession of the claimed invention.  \\n Claim
      12 recites the limitation \u201Cwherein the spring chamber is connected, via
      at least one of the plurality of hydraulic lines, to the hydraulic medium reservoir\u201D
      (lines 32-35), which is a feature found only in the embodiments of figs. 4,
      5a & 5b; but claim 12 also recites \u201Cwherein the hydraulic medium reservoir
      is formed by a partially expanded cross-section of the second partial line;
      and wherein a second connecting hydraulic line is directly connected to the
      opening side chamber, and the second connecting hydraulic line is connected
      to the second partial line\u201D (lines 45-48) which, as understood, is a feature
      only of the embodiment in fig. 2.  \\nIn other words, claim 12 appears directed
      to an improper combination of embodiments, resulting in a new embodiment not
      disclosed (or otherwise not clearly or sufficiently disclosed) in the specification
      as originally filed (i.e. having the spring chamber connected to the hydraulic
      medium reservoir in figs. 4, 5a & 5b AND the hydraulic reservoir in the second
      partial line formed as a partially expanded cross-section, as in fig. 2). Furthermore,
      there is no specific teaching in the originally filed specification that the
      embodiments of figures 2 and 4/5a/5b could be combined in the manner as now
      claimed. \\nAs a result, the claim contains subject matter which was not described
      in the originally filed specification in such a way as to reasonably convey
      to a person having ordinary skill in the  art that the inventors, at the time
      the application was filed, had possession of the claimed invention.\\n Claims
      15 & 22 are rejected due to dependency on claim 12. \\n Claim 13 recites the
      limitation \u201Cwherein the connecting hydraulic line directly connects the
      opening side chamber and the pan side tank connection\u201D (lines 40-41). There
      is no support in the specification as originally filed for an embodiment having
      this limitation. Rather, the disclosed embodiments to which claim 13 appears
      to be directed each show the connecting hydraulic line directly connecting the
      opening side chamber to a partial line 31, which may also form the oil reservoir
      55. It is through this oil reservoir 55 that the opening side chamber is eventually
      connected to the pan side tank connection, not \u201Cdirectly\u201D through
      the connecting hydraulic line, as currently claimed. \\nAs a result, the claim
      contains subject matter which was not described in the originally filed specification
      in such a way as to reasonably convey to a person having ordinary skill in the
      art that the inventors, at the time the application was filed, had possession
      of the claimed invention.\\n Claim 14 is rejected due to dependency on claim

      are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 112(b) or 35 U.S.C. 112 (pre-AIA ), second paragraph,
      as being indefinite for failing to particularly point out and distinctly  claim
      the subject matter which the inventor or a joint inventor, or for pre-AIA  the
      applicant regards as the invention.\\n Claims 11, 12 & 13 each recite the limitation
      \\\"the opening-side\\\" (claim 11, line 10; claim 12, line 11; claim 13, line
      11).  There is insufficient antecedent basis for this limitation in the claims.
      While an \u201Copening-side chamber\u201D is previously established in each
      respective claim, no \u201Copening-side\u201D per se is previously recited.
      \\n Further regarding claims 11, 12 & 13, each recites an armature chamber,
      and further that the armature chamber is configured to be \u201Cfluidically
      connected to a plurality of hydraulic lines of the hydraulic system\u201D, however,
      as best understood, the armature chamber is only configured to be fluidically
      connected to the connecting line and possibly the compensating hydraulic line.
      It is unclear if this limitation wherein a chamber is configured to be \u201Cfluidically
      connected to a plurality of hydraulic lines\u201D was instead intended to refer
      to the hydraulic chamber, disposed between the armature chamber and the spring
      chamber. \\nAppropriate correction and clarification are required. \\n Claims
      16-20 are rejected due to dependency on claim 11. Claims 15 & 22 are rejected
      due to dependency on claim 12. Claim 14 is rejected due to dependency on claim
      13. \\n Claim 14 recites the limitation \\\"the second partial line\\\" in line
      2.  There is insufficient antecedent basis for this limitation in the claim.
      While a \u201Csecond partial line\u201D is established in claim 12, claim 14
      currently depends from independent claim 13, which does not recite that element.
      \\n Regarding claim 15, while claim 12 (from which claim 15 depends) recites
      \u201Ca valve gap providing a bearing clearance\u201D (lines 30-31), it appears
      that this is a different \u201Cvalve gap providing a bearing clearance\u201D
      than that recited in claim 15. In particular, claim 12 further recites  \u201Cthe
      hydraulic chamber configured to leak gap-filtered hydraulic medium into the
      spring chamber via the valve gap\u2026\u201D (lines 31-32), which suggests that
      the valve gap is located adjacent to the spring chamber (e.g. valve gap 49,
      as shown in figs. 3-5b). Conversely, claim 15 recites that \u201Cthe opening
      side chamber of the armature housing is separated from the second partial line
      by a valve housing wall, the valve housing wall comprising a bearing opening,
      wherein the shut-off body is guided through the bearing opening when forming
      the valve gap providing the bearing clearance\u201D. In this case, it appears
      that claim 15 is referring to valve gap 45 (also shown in figs. 3-5b), which
      is a different valve gap, but this is not clearly recited in the claims. \\nAppropriate
      correction and clarification is required. \\n Claim 22 is further rejected due
      to dependency on claim 15. \\n Claim 22 recites the limitations of \\\"the connecting
      hydraulic line\\\", \u201Ca branch of the connecting hydraulic line\u201D and
      \u201Cthe drain line\u201D in lines 3-4.  There is insufficient antecedent basis
      for these limitations in the claim. \\n\"],\n        \"sections.submissionDate\":\"2020-01-13T05:00:00Z\",\n

      ACTION\\nNotice of Pre-AIA  or AIA  Status\\nThe present application, filed
      on or after March 16, 2013, is being examined under the first inventor to file
      provisions of the AIA .\\nResponse to Amendment\\nThis office action is responsive
      to the amendment filed on 23 September 2019.  As directed by the amendment:
      claims 11-13 & 15-17 have been amended, claims 1-10 & 21 were previously cancelled,
      and claim 22 has been added.  Thus, claims 11-20 & 22 are presently pending
      in this application.\\n\\tThe applicant\u2019s amendments have overcome several
      of the objections and 35 U.S.C. 112 rejections set forth in the previous action,
      however, several objections and 35 U.S.C. 112 rejections remain or have otherwise
      been necessitated by the amendments, as set forth below. \\nDrawings\\nThe drawings
      are objected to under 37 CFR 1.83(a).  The drawings must show every feature
      of the invention specified in the claims.  Therefore, embodiments showing the
      following combinations of elements must be shown or the features canceled from
      the claim(s):\\nAn embodiment showing a spring chamber connected, via a hydraulic
      line, to a hydraulic medium reservoir AND wherein the hydraulic medium reservoir
      is formed by a partially expanded cross-section of the second partial line (claim
      12).  \\nAn embodiment wherein a connecting hydraulic line directly connects
      the opening side chamber and a pan-side tank connection (claim 13).\\nSee Related
      35 USC 112(a) rejections below. No new matter should be entered. See Response
      to Arguments section for more details. \\nCorrected drawing sheets in compliance
      with 37 CFR 1.121(d) are required in reply to the Office action to avoid abandonment
      of the application. Any amended replacement drawing sheet should include all
      of the figures appearing on the immediate prior version of the sheet,  even
      if only one figure is being amended. The figure or figure number of an amended
      drawing should not be labeled as \u201Camended.\u201D If a drawing figure is
      to be canceled, the appropriate figure must be removed from the replacement
      sheet, and where necessary, the remaining figures must be renumbered and appropriate
      changes made to the brief description of the several views of the drawings for
      consistency. Additional replacement sheets may be necessary to show the renumbering
      of the remaining figures. Each drawing sheet submitted after the filing date
      of an application must be labeled in the top margin as either \u201CReplacement
      Sheet\u201D or \u201CNew Sheet\u201D pursuant to 37 CFR 1.121(d). If the changes
      are not accepted by the examiner, the applicant will be notified and informed
      of any required corrective action in the next Office action. The objection to
      the drawings will not be held in abeyance.\\nClaim Objections\\nClaim 12 is
      objected to because of the following informalities:  \\nClaim 12 recites a \u201Csecond
      connecting hydraulic line\u201D line lines 47 & 48, however, no other or first
      \u201Cconnecting hydraulic line\u201D is otherwise recited to require this element
      to be designated as \u201Csecond\u201D. As understood, the other elements designated
      as \u201Cconnecting hydraulic line\u201D are only present in mutually exclusive
      embodiments.  \\nAppropriate correction is required.\\nClaim Rejections - 35
      USC \xA7 112\\nThe following is a quotation of the first paragraph of 35 U.S.C.
      112(a):\\n(a) IN GENERAL.\u2014The specification shall contain a written description
      of the invention, and of the manner and process of making and using it, in such
      full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the
      art to which it pertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make
      and use the same, and shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor
      or joint inventor of carrying out the invention.\\n\\nThe following is a quotation
      of the first paragraph of pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 112:\\nThe specification shall
      contain a written description of the invention, and of the manner and process
      of making and using it, in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to
      \ enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which it
      is most nearly connected, to make and use the same, and shall set forth the
      best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention.\\n\\nClaims
      12-15 & 22 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 112(a) or 35 U.S.C. 112 (pre-AIA ),
      first paragraph, as failing to comply with the written description requirement.
      \ The claim(s) contains subject matter which was not described in the specification
      in such a way as to reasonably convey to one skilled in the relevant art that
      the inventor or a joint inventor, or for pre-AIA  the inventor(s), at the time
      the application was filed, had possession of the claimed invention.  \\nClaim
      12 recites the limitation \u201Cwherein the spring chamber is connected, via
      at least one of the plurality of hydraulic lines, to the hydraulic medium reservoir\u201D
      (lines 32-35), which is a feature found only in the embodiments of figs. 4,
      5a & 5b; but claim 12 also recites \u201Cwherein the hydraulic medium reservoir
      is formed by a partially expanded cross-section of the second partial line;
      and wherein a second connecting hydraulic line is directly connected to the
      opening side chamber, and the second connecting hydraulic line is connected
      to the second partial line\u201D (lines 45-48) which, as understood, is a feature
      only of the embodiment in fig. 2.  \\nIn other words, claim 12 appears directed
      to an improper combination of embodiments, resulting in a new embodiment not
      disclosed (or otherwise not clearly or sufficiently disclosed) in the specification
      as originally filed (i.e. having the spring chamber connected to the hydraulic
      medium reservoir in figs. 4, 5a & 5b AND the hydraulic reservoir in the second
      partial line formed as a partially expanded cross-section, as in fig. 2). Furthermore,
      there is no specific teaching in the originally filed specification that the
      embodiments of figures 2 and 4/5a/5b could be combined in the manner as now
      claimed. \\nAs a result, the claim contains subject matter which was not described
      in the originally filed specification in such a way as to reasonably convey
      to a person having ordinary skill in the  art that the inventors, at the time
      the application was filed, had possession of the claimed invention.\\nClaims
      15 & 22 are rejected due to dependency on claim 12. \\n\\nClaim 13 recites the
      limitation \u201Cwherein the connecting hydraulic line directly connects the
      opening side chamber and the pan side tank connection\u201D (lines 40-41). There
      is no support in the specification as originally filed for an embodiment having
      this limitation. Rather, the disclosed embodiments to which claim 13 appears
      to be directed each show the connecting hydraulic line directly connecting the
      opening side chamber to a partial line 31, which may also form the oil reservoir
      55. It is through this oil reservoir 55 that the opening side chamber is eventually
      connected to the pan side tank connection, not \u201Cdirectly\u201D through
      the connecting hydraulic line, as currently claimed. \\nAs a result, the claim
      contains subject matter which was not described in the originally filed specification
      in such a way as to reasonably convey to a person having ordinary skill in the
      art that the inventors, at the time the application was filed, had possession
      of the claimed invention.\\nClaim 14 is rejected due to dependency on claim
      13. \\n\\nThe following is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 112(b):\\n(b)  CONCLUSION.\u2014The
      specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out
      and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the inventor or a joint inventor

      \\\"the opening-side\\\" (claim 11, line 10; claim 12, line 11; claim 13, line
      11).  There is insufficient antecedent basis for this limitation in the claims.
      While an \u201Copening-side chamber\u201D is previously established in each
      respective claim, no \u201Copening-side\u201D per se is previously recited.
      \\n\\nFurther regarding claims 11, 12 & 13, each recites an armature chamber,
      and further that the armature chamber is configured to be \u201Cfluidically

      connected to a plurality of hydraulic lines\u201D was instead intended to refer
      to the hydraulic chamber, disposed between the armature chamber and the spring
      chamber. \\nAppropriate correction and clarification are required. \\nClaims
      16-20 are rejected due to dependency on claim 11. Claims 15 & 22 are rejected
      due to dependency on claim 12. Claim 14 is rejected due to dependency on claim
      13. \\n\\nClaim 14 recites the limitation \\\"the second partial line\\\" in
      line 2.  There is insufficient antecedent basis for this limitation in the claim.
      While a \u201Csecond partial line\u201D is established in claim 12, claim 14
      currently depends from independent claim 13, which does not recite that element.
      \\n\\nRegarding claim 15, while claim 12 (from which claim 15 depends) recites
      \u201Ca valve gap providing a bearing clearance\u201D (lines 30-31), it appears

      occurring, to facilitate the prevention of pathogen contaminating the first
      liquid communication means\u201D is an intended use of the dispensing device.
      An apparatus claim must be distinguished from the prior art in terms of structure
      rather than function. If the prior art apparatus has the claimed structure and
      is capable of performing the intended use then it anticipates the claim (MPEP
      2114).  The device taught by Stephen is capable of such claimed use.\\nWith
      regards to claim 2, Stephen teaches that the dispensing device comprises either
      a pump fed or gravity fed liquid dispensing system (column 3, lines 42-50).
      \ Stephen teaches that he sanitizing liquid comprises heated water (column 1,
      lines 35-53 and column 2, lines 3-5).  Further that \u201Cthe sanitizing liquid
      or gas comprises or contains one or more of the following: ozone gas, chilled
      water, or heated water or steam\\\" is a further intended use of the dispensing
      device.  The dispensing device taught by Stephen is capable of being flushed
      with a sanitizing liquid or gas comprises or contains one or more of the following:
      ozone gas, chilled water, or heated water or steam.\\n With regards to claim
      5, the apparatus taught by Stephen is capable of the intended use of the step
      of delaying dispensing after the request for dispensing has been made, to provide
      the device with time to perform the flushing step a sufficient time to allow
      the device to perform the flushing, sanitizing step..\\nWith regards to claim
      6, Stephen teaches a liquid dispensing device which has a dispensing mechanism
      (cold/hot water mixing taps and pipe leading from them out of the device) (column
      3, lines 23-30) in fluid communication with a first liquid communication means
      (pipe (9) from tank (1) to dispenser (taps)) (fig 1).  The dispensing device
      is capable of the intended use of prior to dispensing the liquid, and after
      a request for dispensing has been made to the system by an operator of the system,
      automatically flushing liquid that has collected in the first liquid communication
      means from the first liquid communication means; and replacing the flushed liquid
      in the first liquid communication means with liquid at a predetermined, desired
      temperature (liquid is taken from the tank into the first communication means
      (pipe 9 from tank to taps) (column 1, lines 35-53 and fig 1).  An apparatus
      claim must be distinguished from the prior art in terms of structure rather
      than function. If the prior art apparatus has the claimed structure and is capable
      of performing the intended use then it anticipates the claim (MPEP 2114).\\nWith
      regards to claim 7, Stephen teaches that the dispensing device comprises either
      a pump fed or gravity fed liquid dispensing system (column 3, lines 42-50).\\nWith
      regards to claim 10, the apparatus taught by Stephen is capable of the intended
      use of the step of delaying dispensing after the request for dispensing has
      been made, a sufficient time to allow the device to perform the flushing and
      replacing steps.\\nWith regards to claim 11, Stephen teaches the use of valves
      (8) as part of the mixing taps/dispensing mechanism which are in fluid communication
      with the first liquid communication means and are capable of use of causing
      a dispensing delay (prevent liquid from being dispensed from the device) (fig
      1).\\nWith regards to claim 13, Stephen teaches that the device includes a pump
      (column 3, lines 42-50).  The device of Stephen is capable of the intended use
      of actuating the one or more pumps before  opening the one or more valves, enabling
      residual liquid in the first liquid communication means to flow out of the first
      liquid communication means.\\nWith regards to claim 15, the device taught by
      Stephen is capable of the intended use of a dispensing delay in a range of 0.5-1.5
      seconds.  \\n Claims 1-3, 5-8, 10, 11, 13, 15-18, 21, and 22 are rejected under
      pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 102b as being anticipated by Witschke et al. (WO 2007/017185).\\nWith
      regards to claim 1, Witschke et al. teaches a liquid dispensing device which
      has a dispensing mechanism (dispensing conduit 26) that is in fluid communication
      with a first liquid communication means (conduit 24) (fig 1).  The device taught
      by Witschke et al. is capable of the intended use of dispensing a liquid through
      a dispensing mechanism (26) that is in fluid communication with a first liquid
      communication means; and periodically, automatically flushing a sanitizing liquid
      or gas through the first liquid communication means during a time when no dispensing
      of the liquid is occuring, to facilitate the prevention of pathogen contaminating
      the first liquid communication means (page 9, final paragraph, fig 1) .  An
      apparatus claim must be distinguished from the prior art in terms of structure
      rather than function. If the prior art apparatus has the claimed structure and
      is capable of performing the intended use then it anticipates the claim (MPEP
      2114).\\nWith regards to claim 2, Witschke et al. teaches that the dispensing
      device comprises either a pump fed or gravity fed dispensing system (pump placed
      along conduit to cause flow) (page 3, middle paragraph).  That \u201Cthe sanitizing
      liquid or gas comprises or contains one or more of the following: ozone gas,
      chilled water, or heated water or steam\\\" is a further intended use of the
      dispensing device.  The dispensing device taught by Witschke is capable of being
      flushed with a sanitizing liquid or gas comprises or contains one or more of
      the following: ozone gas, chilled water, or heated water or steam.\\nWith regards
      to claim 3, Witschke et al. teaches a cold tank (12) containing a chilled liquid
      (water) and the first communication means (24) allows the liquid to flow along
      a first path (path from tank to dispensing conduit 26) between the cold tank
      (12) and the dispensing mechanism (26) (fig 1, middle page 7 through the end
      of page 9).  \\n With regards to claim 5, the apparatus taught by Witschke et
      al. is capable of the intended use of delaying dispensing after the request
      for dispensing has been made, a sufficient time to allow the device to perform
      the flushing, sanitizing step.\\nWith regards to claim 6, Witschke et al. teaches
      a liquid dispensing device which has a dispensing mechanism (dispensing conduit
      26) that is in fluid communication with a first liquid communication means (conduit
      24) (fig 1).  The device taught by Witschke et al. is capable of the intended
      use of prior to dispensing the liquid, and after a request for dispensing has
      been made to the system by an operator of the system, automatically flushing
      liquid that has collected in the first liquid communication means from the first
      liquid communication means; and replacing the flushed liquid in the first liquid
      communication means with liquid at a predetermined, desired temperature (liquid
      is taken from the tank into the first communication means (water that has warmed
      in pipes is replaced with freshly cooled water from the tank) (fig 1, page 9,
      final paragraph).  An apparatus claim must be distinguished from the prior art
      in terms of structure rather than function. If the prior art apparatus has the
      claimed structure and is capable of performing the intended use then it anticipates
      the claim (MPEP 2114).\\nWith regards to claim 7, Witschke et al. teaches that
      the dispensing device comprises either a pump fed or gravity fed dispensing
      system (pump placed along conduit to cause flow) (page 3, middle paragraph).\\nWith
      regards to claim 8, Witschke et al. teaches a cold tank (12) containing a chilled
      liquid (water) and the first communication means (24) allows the liquid to flow
      along a first path (path from tank to dispensing conduit 26) between the cold
      tank (12) and the dispensing mechanism (26) and the replacement liquid is at
      a temperature which is substantially the same as the temperature of the liquid
      in the cold tank (fig 1, middle page 7 through the end of page 9).  \\nWith
      regards to claim 10, the apparatus taught by Witschke et al. is capable of the
      intended use of delaying dispensing after the request for dispensing has been
      made, a sufficient time to allow the device to perform the flushing and replacing
      steps.\\n With regards to claim 11, Witschke et al. teaches the use of valve
      (28) in fluid communication with the first liquid communication means and are
      capable of use of causing a dispensing delay (prevent liquid from being dispensed
      from the device) (fig 1).\\nWith regards to claim 13, Witschke et al. teaches
      that the device includes a pump (page 3, middle paragraph).  The device of Stephen
      is capable of the intended use of actuating the one or more pumps before opening
      the one or more valves, enabling residual liquid in the first liquid communication
      means to flow out of the first liquid communication means.\\nWith regards to
      claim 15, the device taught by Witschke et al. is capable of the intended use
      of a dispensing delay in a range of 0.5-1.5 seconds.  \\nWith regards to claim
      16, Witschke et al. teaches a liquid dispensing system, comprising: a liquid
      supply (tank 12 and inlet 14); a first liquid communication means (conduit 24
      from tank 12 to intersection with horizontal pipe)  allowing the liquid to flow
      along a first path from the liquid supply to a dispenser (dispenser 26) (fig
      1); a pump for drawing the liquid from the liquid supply and causing it to flow
      along the first path as controlled by the user (page 3, middle paragraph, fig
      1).  That the pump automatically activating on a periodic basis during a non-liquid-dispensing
      mode to flush liquid in the first liquid communication means from the first
      liquid communication means, and to replace the flushed liquid with a sanitizing
      liquid, in order to limit the growth of pathogens within the first liquid communication
      means is an intended use of the device. An apparatus claim must be distinguished
      from the prior art in terms of structure rather than function. If the prior
      art apparatus has the claimed structure and is capable of performing the intended
      use then it anticipates the claim (MPEP 2114).  The device taught by Witschke
      et al. is capable of the intended use (fig 1, middle page 7 through the end
      of page 9). \\nWith regards to claim 17, Witschke et al. teaches that the device
      further comprises a second liquid communication means (horizontal pipe from
      input 20 of tank 12 to the T intersection) communicating with the first liquid
      communication means and providing a path permitting residual, warmer liquid
      in the first communication means to be returned to a cold tank (12) (fig 1,
      middle page 7 through the end of page 9).\\n With regards to claim 18, that
      the pump automatically activates during the non-liquid-dispensing mode for a
      period of time which is less than about five percent of a total operating time
      of the system is an intended use of the device.  The device taught by Witschke
      et al. is capable of such use.\\nWith regards to claim 21 and 22 that he sanitizing
      liquid contains ozone, a chilled liquid, or a heated liquid or gas is an intended
      use of the device.  The dispensing device taught by Witschke is capable of being
      flushed with a sanitizing liquid or gas comprises or contains one or more of
      the following: ozone gas, chilled water, or heated water or steam.\\n\"],\n

      et al. (EP 0472276).\\n\\tWith regards to claims 4 and 9, Witschke et al. does
      not teach a hot tank containing a heated liquid along with the cold tank with
      a chilled liquid.  Stephen et al. teaches using a single lever mixing tap to
      provide a dispenser of cold, hot, or mixed water (column 3, lines 23-30).  The
      mixing tap is connected to a source of cold and hot water.  A person having
      ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention would have found it obvious
      to modify the device of Witschke et al. with the addition of the hot water system
      and mixing tap taught by Stephen in order to provide a user with a single dispensing
      point (mixing tap) for obtaining cold, hot, or in-between mix temperature of
      water as desired.  \\nThe combination results in at least one hot tank contained
      a heated liquid (tank 1 of Stephen containing hot water), and a second liquid
      communication (pipe 9 of Stephen) means allows the liquid to  flow along a second
      path between the at least one hot tank and the dispensing mechanism (combination
      of the dispensing conduit connected to the mixing taps 8) (fig 1 of each reference).
      \ That \u201Cthe periodic flushing step includes the step of flushing the sanitizing

      to claim 9 above, and further in view of OPUS (\u201CSystem Domestic Water\u201D).\\n\\tThe
      combination does not specify the material of the piping in the device.  It is
      therefore necessary and thus obvious to look to the prior art for known piping
      materials that are compatable with drinking water systems.  OPUS provides a
      teaching that plastic (PVC) and stainless steel are known to be compatible materials
      for use in domestic water systems (see whole doc).  A person having ordinary
      skill in the art at the time of the invention would have found it obvious to
      have made the pipes (first and second liquid communication means) out of plastic
      (PVC) or stainless steel as taught by OPUS with the expectation of successfully
      practicing the invention of Witschke et al. and Stephen.\\n Claim 12 is rejected

      et al. does not teach a cracking pressure for the valves.  Gerber et al. teaches
      a seal/valve assembly for dispensing a liquid (abstract).  Gerber et al. teaches
      that the cracking pressure of a seal can be optimized in order to achieve how
      easy or difficult it is to achieve flow through the valve/seal assembly (column

      \ Witschke et al., however, is silent as to the specific construction of a solenoid
      valve.  It is thus necessary and therefore obvious to look to the prior art
      for a known construction of a solenoid valve.  Allen Jr. provides a teaching
      of a solenoid valve that uses a spring to hold the seal pin in the closed position
      (abstract, column 2, lines 60-68, and column 3, lines 1-2 and fig 4).  A person

      argues that Stephens and Witschke do not teach the claims as amended which include
      a sanitizing flush.  The examiner disagrees.  The periodic automatic flushing
      with a sanitizing liquid is an intended use of the dispensing devices taught
      by Stephen and Witschke.  An apparatus claim must be distinguished from the
      prior art in terms of structure rather than function. If the prior art apparatus
      has the claimed structure and is capable of performing the intended use then
      it anticipates the claim (MPEP 2114).  The devices taught by Stephen and Witschke
      are capable of being flushed as claimed.  This shall be elaborated further in
      the rejection presented below.  Further Stephen does teach a sterilizing flush
      as Stephen teaches flushing scalding hot water through the device which is capable

      rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 102 b as being anticipated by Stephen et al.
      (EP 0472276).\\nWith regards to claim 1, Stephen teaches a liquid dispensing
      device which has a dispensing mechanism (cold/hot water mixing taps and pipe
      leading from them out of the device) (column 3, lines 23-30) in fluid communication
      with a first liquid communication means (pipe (9) from tank (1) to dispenser
      (taps)) (fig 1).  The dispensing device is capable of the intended use of dispensing
      a liquid through a dispensing mechanism (mixer taps) that is in fluid communication
      with a first liquid communication means (pipe 9 from tank to taps) ; and periodically,
      automatically flushing a sanitizing liquid (scalding hot water that kills legionella)
      through the first liquid communication means from the first liquid communication
      means during a time when no dispensing of the liquid is occurring, to facilitate
      the prevention of pathogen contaminating the first liquid communication means
      (column 1, lines 35-53 and column 2, lines 3-5).  Further \u201Cperiodically,
      automatically flushing a sanitizing liquid through the first liquid communication
      means from the first liquid communication means during a time when no dispensing
      of the liquid is occurring, to facilitate the prevention of pathogen contaminating
      the first liquid communication means\u201D is an intended use of the dispensing
      device. An apparatus claim must be distinguished from the prior art in terms
      of structure rather than function. If the prior art apparatus has the claimed
      structure and is capable of performing the intended use then it anticipates
      the claim (MPEP 2114).  The device taught by Stephen is capable of such claimed
      use.\\nWith regards to claim 2, Stephen teaches that the dispensing device comprises
      either a pump fed or gravity fed liquid dispensing system (column 3, lines 42-50).
      \ Stephen teaches that he sanitizing liquid comprises heated water (column 1,
      lines 35-53 and column 2, lines 3-5).  Further that \u201Cthe sanitizing liquid
      or gas comprises or contains one or more of the following: ozone gas, chilled
      water, or heated water or steam\\\" is a further intended use of the dispensing
      device.  The dispensing device taught by Stephen is capable of being flushed
      with a sanitizing liquid or gas comprises or contains one or more of the following:
      ozone gas, chilled water, or heated water or steam.\\n With regards to claim
      5, the apparatus taught by Stephen is capable of the intended use of the step
      of delaying dispensing after the request for dispensing has been made, to provide
      the device with time to perform the flushing step a sufficient time to allow
      the device to perform the flushing, sanitizing step..\\nWith regards to claim
      6, Stephen teaches a liquid dispensing device which has a dispensing mechanism
      (cold/hot water mixing taps and pipe leading from them out of the device) (column
      3, lines 23-30) in fluid communication with a first liquid communication means
      (pipe (9) from tank (1) to dispenser (taps)) (fig 1).  The dispensing device
      is capable of the intended use of prior to dispensing the liquid, and after
      a request for dispensing has been made to the system by an operator of the system,
      automatically flushing liquid that has collected in the first liquid communication
      means from the first liquid communication means; and replacing the flushed liquid
      in the first liquid communication means with liquid at a predetermined, desired
      temperature (liquid is taken from the tank into the first communication means
      (pipe 9 from tank to taps) (column 1, lines 35-53 and fig 1).  An apparatus
      claim must be distinguished from the prior art in terms of structure rather
      than function. If the prior art apparatus has the claimed structure and is capable
      of performing the intended use then it anticipates the claim (MPEP 2114).\\nWith
      regards to claim 7, Stephen teaches that the dispensing device comprises either
      a pump fed or gravity fed liquid dispensing system (column 3, lines 42-50).\\nWith
      regards to claim 10, the apparatus taught by Stephen is capable of the intended
      use of the step of delaying dispensing after the request for dispensing has
      been made, a sufficient time to allow the device to perform the flushing and
      replacing steps.\\nWith regards to claim 11, Stephen teaches the use of valves
      (8) as part of the mixing taps/dispensing mechanism which are in fluid communication
      with the first liquid communication means and are capable of use of causing
      a dispensing delay (prevent liquid from being dispensed from the device) (fig
      1).\\nWith regards to claim 13, Stephen teaches that the device includes a pump
      (column 3, lines 42-50).  The device of Stephen is capable of the intended use
      of actuating the one or more pumps before  opening the one or more valves, enabling
      residual liquid in the first liquid communication means to flow out of the first
      liquid communication means.\\nWith regards to claim 15, the device taught by
      Stephen is capable of the intended use of a dispensing delay in a range of 0.5-1.5
      seconds.  \\n\\nClaims 1-3, 5-8, 10, 11, 13, 15-18, 21, and 22 are rejected
      under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 102b as being anticipated by Witschke et al. (WO 2007/017185).\\nWith
      regards to claim 1, Witschke et al. teaches a liquid dispensing device which
      has a dispensing mechanism (dispensing conduit 26) that is in fluid communication
      with a first liquid communication means (conduit 24) (fig 1).  The device taught
      by Witschke et al. is capable of the intended use of dispensing a liquid through
      a dispensing mechanism (26) that is in fluid communication with a first liquid
      communication means; and periodically, automatically flushing a sanitizing liquid
      or gas through the first liquid communication means during a time when no dispensing
      of the liquid is occuring, to facilitate the prevention of pathogen contaminating
      the first liquid communication means (page 9, final paragraph, fig 1) .  An
      apparatus claim must be distinguished from the prior art in terms of structure
      rather than function. If the prior art apparatus has the claimed structure and
      is capable of performing the intended use then it anticipates the claim (MPEP
      2114).\\nWith regards to claim 2, Witschke et al. teaches that the dispensing
      device comprises either a pump fed or gravity fed dispensing system (pump placed
      along conduit to cause flow) (page 3, middle paragraph).  That \u201Cthe sanitizing
      liquid or gas comprises or contains one or more of the following: ozone gas,
      chilled water, or heated water or steam\\\" is a further intended use of the
      dispensing device.  The dispensing device taught by Witschke is capable of being
      flushed with a sanitizing liquid or gas comprises or contains one or more of
      the following: ozone gas, chilled water, or heated water or steam.\\nWith regards
      to claim 3, Witschke et al. teaches a cold tank (12) containing a chilled liquid
      (water) and the first communication means (24) allows the liquid to flow along
      a first path (path from tank to dispensing conduit 26) between the cold tank
      (12) and the dispensing mechanism (26) (fig 1, middle page 7 through the end
      of page 9).  \\n With regards to claim 5, the apparatus taught by Witschke et
      al. is capable of the intended use of delaying dispensing after the request
      for dispensing has been made, a sufficient time to allow the device to perform
      the flushing, sanitizing step.\\nWith regards to claim 6, Witschke et al. teaches
      a liquid dispensing device which has a dispensing mechanism (dispensing conduit
      26) that is in fluid communication with a first liquid communication means (conduit
      24) (fig 1).  The device taught by Witschke et al. is capable of the intended
      use of prior to dispensing the liquid, and after a request for dispensing has
      been made to the system by an operator of the system, automatically flushing
      liquid that has collected in the first liquid communication means from the first
      liquid communication means; and replacing the flushed liquid in the first liquid
      communication means with liquid at a predetermined, desired temperature (liquid
      is taken from the tank into the first communication means (water that has warmed
      in pipes is replaced with freshly cooled water from the tank) (fig 1, page 9,
      final paragraph).  An apparatus claim must be distinguished from the prior art
      in terms of structure rather than function. If the prior art apparatus has the
      claimed structure and is capable of performing the intended use then it anticipates
      the claim (MPEP 2114).\\nWith regards to claim 7, Witschke et al. teaches that
      the dispensing device comprises either a pump fed or gravity fed dispensing
      system (pump placed along conduit to cause flow) (page 3, middle paragraph).\\nWith
      regards to claim 8, Witschke et al. teaches a cold tank (12) containing a chilled
      liquid (water) and the first communication means (24) allows the liquid to flow
      along a first path (path from tank to dispensing conduit 26) between the cold
      tank (12) and the dispensing mechanism (26) and the replacement liquid is at
      a temperature which is substantially the same as the temperature of the liquid
      in the cold tank (fig 1, middle page 7 through the end of page 9).  \\nWith
      regards to claim 10, the apparatus taught by Witschke et al. is capable of the
      intended use of delaying dispensing after the request for dispensing has been
      made, a sufficient time to allow the device to perform the flushing and replacing
      steps.\\n With regards to claim 11, Witschke et al. teaches the use of valve
      (28) in fluid communication with the first liquid communication means and are
      capable of use of causing a dispensing delay (prevent liquid from being dispensed
      from the device) (fig 1).\\nWith regards to claim 13, Witschke et al. teaches
      that the device includes a pump (page 3, middle paragraph).  The device of Stephen
      is capable of the intended use of actuating the one or more pumps before opening
      the one or more valves, enabling residual liquid in the first liquid communication
      means to flow out of the first liquid communication means.\\nWith regards to
      claim 15, the device taught by Witschke et al. is capable of the intended use
      of a dispensing delay in a range of 0.5-1.5 seconds.  \\nWith regards to claim
      16, Witschke et al. teaches a liquid dispensing system, comprising: a liquid
      supply (tank 12 and inlet 14); a first liquid communication means (conduit 24
      from tank 12 to intersection with horizontal pipe)  allowing the liquid to flow
      along a first path from the liquid supply to a dispenser (dispenser 26) (fig
      1); a pump for drawing the liquid from the liquid supply and causing it to flow
      along the first path as controlled by the user (page 3, middle paragraph, fig
      1).  That the pump automatically activating on a periodic basis during a non-liquid-dispensing
      mode to flush liquid in the first liquid communication means from the first
      liquid communication means, and to replace the flushed liquid with a sanitizing
      liquid, in order to limit the growth of pathogens within the first liquid communication
      means is an intended use of the device. An apparatus claim must be distinguished
      from the prior art in terms of structure rather than function. If the prior
      art apparatus has the claimed structure and is capable of performing the intended
      use then it anticipates the claim (MPEP 2114).  The device taught by Witschke
      et al. is capable of the intended use (fig 1, middle page 7 through the end
      of page 9). \\nWith regards to claim 17, Witschke et al. teaches that the device
      further comprises a second liquid communication means (horizontal pipe from
      input 20 of tank 12 to the T intersection) communicating with the first liquid
      communication means and providing a path permitting residual, warmer liquid
      in the first communication means to be returned to a cold tank (12) (fig 1,
      middle page 7 through the end of page 9).\\n With regards to claim 18, that
      the pump automatically activates during the non-liquid-dispensing mode for a
      period of time which is less than about five percent of a total operating time
      of the system is an intended use of the device.  The device taught by Witschke
      et al. is capable of such use.\\nWith regards to claim 21 and 22 that he sanitizing
      liquid contains ozone, a chilled liquid, or a heated liquid or gas is an intended
      use of the device.  The dispensing device taught by Witschke is capable of being
      flushed with a sanitizing liquid or gas comprises or contains one or more of
      the following: ozone gas, chilled water, or heated water or steam.\\n\\nClaim
      Rejections - 35 USC \xA7 103\\nThe following is a quotation of pre-AIA  35 U.S.C.
      103(a) which forms the basis for all obviousness rejections set forth in this
      Office action:\\n(a) A patent may not be obtained though the invention is not
      identically disclosed or described as set forth in section 102 of this title,
      if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the
      prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious
      at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the
      art to which said subject matter pertains.  Patentability shall not be negatived
      by the manner in which the invention was made.\\n\\n\\nClaims 4 and 9 are rejected
      under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Witschke et al. (WO
      2007/017185) as applied to claims 1 and 6 above, and further in view of Stephen
      et al. (EP 0472276).\\n\\tWith regards to claims 4 and 9, Witschke et al. does
      not teach a hot tank containing a heated liquid along with the cold tank with
      a chilled liquid.  Stephen et al. teaches using a single lever mixing tap to
      provide a dispenser of cold, hot, or mixed water (column 3, lines 23-30).  The
      mixing tap is connected to a source of cold and hot water.  A person having
      ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention would have found it obvious
      to modify the device of Witschke et al. with the addition of the hot water system
      and mixing tap taught by Stephen in order to provide a user with a single dispensing
      point (mixing tap) for obtaining cold, hot, or in-between mix temperature of
      water as desired.  \\nThe combination results in at least one hot tank contained
      a heated liquid (tank 1 of Stephen containing hot water), and a second liquid
      communication (pipe 9 of Stephen) means allows the liquid to  flow along a second
      path between the at least one hot tank and the dispensing mechanism (combination
      of the dispensing conduit connected to the mixing taps 8) (fig 1 of each reference).
      \ That \u201Cthe periodic flushing step includes the step of flushing the sanitizing
      liquid or gas through in the second liquid communication means during a time
      when no dispensing of the liquid is occurring, to facilitate the prevention
      of pathogen contaminating the second liquid communication mean\u201D is an intended
      use of the combined device.  That \u201Cthe automatic flushing step may include
      the step of flushing liquid collecting in the second liquid communication means
      from the second liquid communication means, and wherein the replacing step may
      include the step of replacing the flushed liquid from the second liquid communication
      means with liquid at a predetermined, desired, heated temperature which is substantially
      the same as the temperature of the liquid in the hot tank\u201D is an intended
      use of the device.  An apparatus claim must be distinguished from the prior
      art in terms of structure rather than function. If the prior art apparatus has
      the claimed structure and is capable of performing the intended use then it
      anticipates the claim (MPEP 2114).  The apparatus is capable of such use.\\nClaim
      14 is rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Witschke
      et al. (WO 2007/017185) and Stephen et al. (EP 0472276) as applied to claim
      9 above, and further in view of OPUS (\u201CSystem Domestic Water\u201D).\\n\\tThe
      combination does not specify the material of the piping in the device.  It is
      therefore necessary and thus obvious to look to the prior art for known piping
      materials that are compatable with drinking water systems.  OPUS provides a
      teaching that plastic (PVC) and stainless steel are known to be compatible materials
      for use in domestic water systems (see whole doc).  A person having ordinary
      skill in the art at the time of the invention would have found it obvious to
      have made the pipes (first and second liquid communication means) out of plastic
      (PVC) or stainless steel as taught by OPUS with the expectation of successfully
      practicing the invention of Witschke et al. and Stephen.\\nClaim 12 is rejected
      under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Witschke et al. (WO
      2007/017185) as applied to claim 11 above, and further in view of Gerber et
      al. (US Patent 6,202,901) and Allen Jr. (US Patent 4,268,009).\\n \\tWitschke
      et al. does not teach a cracking pressure for the valves.  Gerber et al. teaches
      a seal/valve assembly for dispensing a liquid (abstract).  Gerber et al. teaches
      that the cracking pressure of a seal can be optimized in order to achieve how
      easy or difficult it is to achieve flow through the valve/seal assembly (column
      6, lines 24-29 and column 12, lines 40-41).  A person having ordinary skill
      in the art at the time of the invention would have found it obvious to have
      optimized the cracking pressure in order to achieve the desired ease of flow.\\nWitschke
      et al. teaches that the valve is a solenoid valve (page 4, last paragraph).
      \ Witschke et al., however, is silent as to the specific construction of a solenoid
      valve.  It is thus necessary and therefore obvious to look to the prior art
      for a known construction of a solenoid valve.  Allen Jr. provides a teaching
      of a solenoid valve that uses a spring to hold the seal pin in the closed position
      (abstract, column 2, lines 60-68, and column 3, lines 1-2 and fig 4).  A person
      having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention would have found
      it obvious to have made the solenoid valve have a closed biasing spring as taught
      by Allen Jr. motivated by the expectation of successfully practicing the invention
      of Witschke et al. The spring in the solenoid valve holds the valve close determining
      the cracking pressure.\\n\\nConclusion\\nApplicant's amendment necessitated
      the new ground(s) of rejection presented in this Office action.  Accordingly,
      THIS ACTION IS MADE FINAL.  See MPEP \xA7 706.07(a).  Applicant is reminded
      of the extension of time policy as set forth in 37 CFR 1.136(a).  \\nA shortened
      statutory period for reply to this final action is set to expire THREE MONTHS
      from the mailing date of this action.  In the event a first reply is filed within
      TWO MONTHS of the mailing date of this final action and the advisory action
      is not mailed until after the end of the THREE-MONTH shortened statutory period,
      then the shortened statutory period will expire on the date the advisory action
      is mailed, and any extension fee pursuant to 37 CFR 1.136(a) will be calculated
      from the mailing date of the advisory action.  In no event, however, will the
      statutory period for reply expire later than SIX MONTHS from the date of this
      final action. \\n Any inquiry concerning this communication or earlier communications

      contains claims directed to the following patentably distinct species: \\n          Species
      A; wherein the interlayer/moisture absorbing film is PVB (corresponding to claims
      14 and 19).\\n         Species B; wherein the interlayer/moisture absorbing
      film is EVA (corresponding to claim 19).\\n         Species C; wherein the interlayer/moisture
      absorbing film is thermochromic PVB (corresponding to claims 12 and 26).\\n
      \         The species are independent or distinct because of the distinct materials
      for the film as stated above. In addition, these species are not obvious variants
      of each other based on the current record.\\nApplicant is required under 35
      U.S.C. 121 to elect a single disclosed species, or a single grouping of patentably
      indistinct species, for prosecution on the merits to which the claims shall
      be restricted if no generic claim is finally held to be allowable. Currently,
      claim 1 is generic.\\nThere is a search and/or examination burden for the patentably
      distinct species as set forth above because at least the following reason(s)
      apply: \\n The distinct species would require searching separate class/subclasses
      and require a different field of search comprising different search strategies
      and/or search queries.\\nApplicant is advised that the reply to this requirement
      to be complete must include (i) an election of a species or a grouping of patentably
      indistinct species to be examined even though the requirement may be traversed
      (37 CFR 1.143) and (ii) identification of the claims encompassing the elected
      species or grouping of patentably indistinct species, including any claims subsequently
      added. An argument that a claim is allowable or that all claims are generic
      is considered nonresponsive unless accompanied by an election.\\nThe election
      may be made with or without traverse. To preserve a right to petition, the election
      must be made with traverse. If the reply does not distinctly and specifically
      point out supposed errors in the election of species requirement, the election
      shall be treated as an election without traverse. Traversal must be presented
      at the time of election in order to be considered timely. Failure to timely
      traverse the requirement will result in the loss of right to petition under
      37 CFR 1.144. If claims are added after the election, applicant must indicate
      which of these claims are readable on the elected species or grouping of patentably
      indistinct species.\\nShould applicant traverse on the ground that the species,
      or groupings of patentably indistinct species from which election is required,
      are not patentably distinct, applicant should submit evidence or identify such
      evidence now of record showing them to be obvious variants or clearly admit
      on the record that this is the case. In either  instance, if the examiner finds
      one of the species unpatentable over the prior art, the evidence or admission
      may be used in a rejection under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) of the other species.\\nUpon
      the allowance of a generic claim, applicant will be entitled to consideration
      of claims to additional species which depend from or otherwise require all the
      limitations of an allowable generic claim as provided by 37 CFR 1.141.\\nApplicant
      is reminded that upon the cancellation of claims to a non-elected invention,
      the inventorship must be amended in compliance with 37 CFR 1.48(b) if one or
      more of the currently named inventors is no longer an inventor of at least one
      claim remaining in the application. Any amendment of inventorship must be accompanied

      to one of the following inventions is required under 35 U.S.C. 121:\\nI.\\tClaims
      1-14, drawn to a slider, classified in class 360, subclass 125.31 or 125.32.\\nII.\\tClaims
      15-19, drawn to a method of controlling a flying height of a slider, classified
      in class 29, subclass 603.07.\\nThe inventions are distinct, each from the other
      because of the following reasons:\\nInventions I and II are related as product
      and process of use.  The inventions can be shown to be distinct if either or
      both of the following can be shown: (1) the process for using the product as
      claimed can be practiced with another materially different product or (2) the
      product as claimed can be used in a materially different process of using that
      product. See MPEP \xA7 806.05(h).  In the instant case the product as claimed
      can be used in a materially different process, such as a process in which no
      electrical current is applied to the heater.\\nRestriction for examination purposes
      as indicated is proper because all these inventions listed in this action are
      independent or distinct for the reasons given above and there would be a serious
      search and/or examination burden if restriction were not required because at
      least the following reason(s) apply:\\nDifferent search strategies are expected
      to be appropriate, and fewer than all prior art applicable to one group would
      be expected to be applicable to the other group.\\nApplicant is advised that
      the reply to this requirement to be complete must include (i) an election of
      a invention to be examined even though the requirement may be traversed (37
      CFR 1.143) and (ii) identification of the claims encompassing the elected invention.
      \\n The election of an invention may be made with or without traverse. To reserve
      a right to petition, the election must be made with traverse. If the reply does
      not distinctly and specifically point out supposed errors in the restriction
      requirement, the election shall be treated as an election without traverse.
      Traversal must be presented at the time of election in order to be considered
      timely. Failure to timely traverse the requirement will result in the loss of
      right to petition under 37 CFR 1.144. If claims are added after the election,
      applicant must indicate which of these claims are readable upon the elected
      invention.\\nShould applicant traverse on the ground that the inventions are
      not patentably distinct, applicant should submit evidence or identify such evidence
      now of record showing the inventions to be obvious variants or clearly admit
      on the record that this is the case. In either instance, if the examiner finds
      one of the inventions unpatentable over the prior art, the evidence or admission
      may be used in a rejection under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) of the other invention.\\nThis
      application contains claims directed to the following patentably distinct species:\\nSpecies
      A, drawn to Figs. 4-5, and \\nSpecies B, drawn to Fig. 6. \\nThe species are
      independent or distinct because they have different modes of operation. In addition,
      these species are not obvious variants of each other based on the current record.\\nApplicant
      is required under 35 U.S.C. 121 to elect a single disclosed species, or a single
      grouping of patentably indistinct species, for prosecution on the merits to
      which the claims shall be restricted if no generic claim is finally held to
      be allowable. Currently, no claim appears generic.\\n There is a search and/or
      examination burden for the patentably distinct species as set forth above because
      at least the following reason(s) apply: \\nDifferent search strategies are expected
      to be relevant to each species, and the prior art applicable to one species
      is not necessarily expected to be applicable to the other species.\\nApplicant
      is advised that the reply to this requirement to be complete must include (i)
      an election of a species or a grouping of patentably indistinct species to be
      examined even though the requirement may be traversed (37 CFR 1.143) and (ii)
      identification of the claims encompassing the elected species or grouping of
      patentably indistinct species, including any claims subsequently added. An argument
      that a claim is allowable or that all claims are generic is considered nonresponsive
      unless accompanied by an election.\\nThe election may be made with or without
      traverse. To preserve a right to petition, the election must be made with traverse.
      If the reply does not distinctly and specifically point out supposed errors
      in the election of species requirement, the election shall be treated as an
      election without traverse. Traversal must be presented at the time of election
      in order to be considered timely. Failure to timely traverse the requirement
      will result in the loss of right to petition under 37 CFR 1.144. If claims are
      added after the election, applicant must indicate which of these claims are
      readable on the elected species or grouping of patentably indistinct species.\\nShould
      applicant traverse on the ground that the species, or groupings of patentably
      indistinct species from which election is required, are not patentably distinct,
      applicant should submit evidence or identify such evidence now of record showing
      them to be obvious variants or clearly admit on the record that this is the
      case. In either instance, if the examiner finds one of  the species unpatentable
      over the prior art, the evidence or admission may be used in a rejection under
      35 U.S.C. 103(a) of the other species.\\nUpon the allowance of a generic claim,
      applicant will be entitled to consideration of claims to additional species
      which depend from or otherwise require all the limitations of an allowable generic
      claim as provided by 37 CFR 1.141.\\nApplicant is reminded that upon the cancellation
      of claims to a non-elected invention, the inventorship must be amended in compliance
      with 37 CFR 1.48(b) if one or more of the currently named inventors is no longer
      an inventor of at least one claim remaining in the application. Any amendment
      of inventorship must be accompanied by a request under 37 CFR 1.48(b) and by
      the fee required under 37 CFR 1.17(i).\\nConclusion\\nInformation regarding

      ACTION\\nNotice of Pre-AIA  or AIA  Status\\nThe present application is being
      examined under the pre-AIA  first to invent provisions. \\nContinued Examination
      Under 37 CFR 1.114\\nA request for continued examination under 37 CFR 1.114,
      including the fee set forth in 37 CFR 1.17(e), was filed in this application
      after final rejection.  Since this application is eligible for continued examination
      under 37 CFR 1.114, and the fee set forth in 37 CFR 1.17(e) has been timely
      paid, the finality of the previous Office action has been withdrawn pursuant
      to 37 CFR 1.114.  Applicant's submission filed on 08/11/2017 has been entered.\\nResponse
      to Arguments\\nApplicant's arguments filed on 08/11/2017 have been fully considered
      but they are not persuasive. \\nExaminer notes that while Applicant may have
      found a solution to a problem in their own design (using metal or protrusions
      for rigidity), that is not enough to demonstrate that it is not obvious as an
      advantage which would flow naturally from following the suggestion of the prior
      art (such as use of metal and protrusions).  See Ex parte Obiaya, 227 USPQ 58,
      60 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1985).  \\nApplicant notes:  \u201CAs noted in their
      Specification, existing display devices suffer from a problem of reduced rigidity
      of the rear side holding member, in cases in which the rear side holding member
      is made of resin. By including, inter alia, the now claimed \\\"first and second
      protruding portions,\\\" Applicants' inventive display device provides a solution
      to the above-referenced problem by improving rigidity. See id. at iii! [0004]
      - [0030].\u201D\\nExaminer notes that (a) a protrusion, which has a broad spectrum
      of embodiments, does not necessarily result in increased rigidity, and (b) limitations
      in the specification may not be read into the claims.  Examiner suggests elaborating
      the claim limitation on the type and structure of the protrusions that Applicant
      believes to be inventive so that they can be particularly evaluated with respect
      to the prior art.\\nApplicant argues:  \u201Ca particular advantage that \\\"the
      substrate mounting member and the holding member can be tightly fixed to each
      other\\\" can be achieved.\u201D\\nExaminer notes that both Okuda and Kimura
      provide embodiments of notches and protrusions for coupling/aligning the components
      to each other.  See below.  The question remains about what is unique about
      Applicant's intended notches/protrusions.\\nClaim Rejections - 35 USC \xA7 103\\nIn
      the event the determination of the status of the application as subject to AIA
      \ 35 U.S.C. 102 and 103 (or as subject to pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 102 and 103) is
      incorrect, any correction of the statutory basis for the rejection will not
      be considered a new ground of rejection if the prior art relied upon, and the
      rationale supporting the rejection, would be the same under either status.  \\nThe
      following is a quotation of pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) which forms the basis
      for all obviousness rejections set forth in this Office action:\\n(a) A patent
      may not be obtained though the invention is not identically disclosed or described
      as set forth in section 102 of this title, if the differences between the subject
      matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter
      as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person
      having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.  Patentability
      shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made.\\n\\n\\nThe
      factual inquiries set forth in Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 148 USPQ
      459 (1966), that are applied for establishing a background for determining obviousness
      under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) are summarized as follows:\\n1. Determining
      the scope and contents of the prior art.\\n2. Ascertaining the differences between
      the prior art and the claims at issue.\\n3. Resolving the level of ordinary
      skill in the pertinent art.\\n4. Considering objective evidence present in the
      application indicating obviousness or nonobviousness.\\nClaims 1, 3, 5, 7-13,15,

      to fig. 10\\nF. emitting light color\\n\\tF1 drawn to fig. 11\\n\\tF2 drawn
      to fig. 12\\n\\n \\nThe species are independent or distinct because embodiments
      describe different structures. In addition, these species are not obvious variants
      of each other based on the current record.\\nApplicant is required under 35
      U.S.C. 121 to elect a single disclosed species, or a single grouping of patentably
      indistinct species, for prosecution on the merits to which the claims shall
      be restricted if no generic claim is finally held to be allowable. Currently,
      it appears that no claim is generic.\\nThere is a search and/or examination
      burden for the patentably distinct species as set forth above because at least
      the following reason(s) apply: \\nthe inventions have acquired a separate status
      in the art in view of their different classification\\nthe inventions have acquired
      a separate status in the art due to their recognized divergent subject matter\\nthe
      inventions require a different field of search (e.g., searching different classes
      /subclasses or electronic resources, or employing different search strategies
      or search queries).\\n--the species or groupings of patentably indistinct species
      have acquired a separate status in the art in view of their different classification
      \ \\n--the species or groupings of patentably indistinct species have acquired
      a separate status in the art due to their recognized divergent subject matter
      \\n--the species or groupings of patentably indistinct species require a different
      field of search (e.g., searching different classes/subclasses or electronic
      resources, or employing different search strategies or search queries); and/or
      \\n--the prior art applicable to one group or species would not likely be applicable
      to another group or species; the group or species are likely to raise different
      non-prior art issues under 35 U.S.C. 101 and/or 35 U.S.C. 112, first paragraph.
      \\n\\nApplicant is advised that the reply to this requirement to be complete
      must include (i) an election of a species or a grouping of patentably indistinct
      species to be examined even though the requirement may be traversed (37 CFR
      1.143) and (ii) identification of the claims encompassing the elected species
      or grouping of patentably indistinct species, including any claims subsequently
      added. An argument that a claim is allowable or that all claims are generic
      is considered nonresponsive unless accompanied by an election.\\nThe election
      may be made with or without traverse. To preserve a right to petition, the election
      must be made with traverse. If the reply does not distinctly and specifically
      point out supposed errors in the election of species requirement, the election
      shall be treated as an election without traverse. Traversal must be presented
      at the time of election in order to be considered timely. Failure to timely
      traverse the requirement will result in the loss of right to petition under
      37 CFR 1.144. If claims are added after the election, applicant must indicate
      which of these claims are readable on the elected species or grouping of patentably
      indistinct species.\\n Should applicant traverse on the ground that the species,
      or groupings of patentably indistinct species from which election is required,
      are not patentably distinct, applicant should submit evidence or identify such
      evidence now of record showing them to be obvious variants or clearly admit
      on the record that this is the case. In either instance, if the examiner finds
      one of the species unpatentable over the prior art, the evidence or admission
      may be used in a rejection under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) of the other species.\\nUpon
      the allowance of a generic claim, applicant will be entitled to consideration
      of claims to additional species which depend from or otherwise require all the
      limitations of an allowable generic claim as provided by 37 CFR 1.141.\\nApplicant
      is reminded that upon the cancellation of claims to a non-elected invention,
      the inventorship must be amended in compliance with 37 CFR 1.48(b) if one or
      more of the currently named inventors is no longer an inventor of at least one
      claim remaining in the application. Any amendment of inventorship must be accompanied
      by a request under 37 CFR 1.48(b) and by the fee required under 37 CFR 1.17(i).\\nAny

      is an examiner\u2019s statement of reasons for allowance: \\nThe arguments presented
      07/15/2013 were found persuasive. In particular, the arguments regarding vaporization
      of 95% of the effluent wherein at least 90% of the atomic carbon of the feedstock
      is present in the condensed liquid distinguish the process over the closest
      prior art process the CANMET slurry hydrocracking process disclosed in Rana.
      \ Although Rana does disclose a 98% conversion rate for coal, Rana characterizes
      the product as distillate and distillable residue.  There is no indication in
      Rana that the product of the reactor is 90% or greater vapor upon exiting the
      reactor.  The CANMET process is expected to produce 50% distillate yield. See,
      e.g., Gillis, et al., Upgrading Residues to Maximize Distillate Yields, UOP,
      2009, p.1\u201319. Further, the CANMET process is disclosed as having non-distillable
      conversion above 90%. (p. 1).  In contrast, the instant invention requires distillable
      (that is, condensable) conversion above 90%.  \\nAny comments considered necessary

      \       \"bodyText\":[\"DETAILED ACTION\\nThe present application is being examined
      under the pre-AIA  first to invent provisions. \\n\\n  Double Patenting\\nThe
      nonstatutory double patenting rejection is based on a judicially created doctrine
      grounded in public policy (a policy reflected in the statute) so as to prevent
      the unjustified or improper timewise extension of the \u201Cright to exclude\u201D
      granted by a patent and to prevent possible harassment by multiple assignees.
      \  A nonstatutory obviousness-type double patenting rejection is appropriate
      where the conflicting claims are not identical, but at least one examined application
      claim is not patentably distinct from the reference claim(s) because the examined
      application claim is either anticipated by, or would have been obvious over,
      the reference claim(s). See, e.g., In re Berg, 140 F.3d 1428, 46 USPQ2d 1226
      (Fed. Cir. 1998); In re Goodman, 11 F.3d 1046, 29 USPQ2d 2010 (Fed. Cir. 1993);
      In re Longi, 759 F.2d 887, 225 USPQ 645 (Fed. Cir. 1985); In re Van Ornum, 686
      F.2d 937, 214 USPQ 761 (CCPA 1982); In re Vogel, 422 F.2d 438, 164 USPQ 619
      (CCPA 1970); and  In re Thorington, 418 F.2d 528, 163 USPQ 644 (CCPA 1969).\\nA
      timely filed terminal disclaimer in compliance with 37 CFR 1.321(c) or 1.321(d)
      may be used to overcome an actual or provisional rejection based on a nonstatutory
      double patenting ground provided the conflicting application or patent either
      is shown to be commonly owned with this application, or claims an invention
      made as a result of activities undertaken within the scope of a joint research
      agreement. \\nEffective January 1, 1994, a registered attorney or agent of record
      may sign a terminal disclaimer. A terminal disclaimer signed by the assignee
      must fully comply with 37 CFR 3.73(b).\\nClaim 1-13 are rejected on the ground
      of nonstatutory double patenting as being unpatentable over claims 1-14 of U.S.
      Patent No. 8,949,825. Claim 1 of the present application is substantially identical
      to claim 1 of U.S. Patent No. 8,949,825.  The only difference between the claims
      is the inclusion of the phrase \u201Cvirtual appliance\u201D in place of \u201Cvirtual
      machine\u201D in claim 1 of U.S. Patent No. 8,949,825. It would have been obvious
      to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to include
      the use of a \u201Cvirtual appliance\u201D instead of \u201Cvirtual machine\u201D
      as these terms are interchangeable in the art.\\n\\nClaim 1-13 are rejected
      on the ground of nonstatutory double patenting as being unpatentable over claims
      1-10 of U.S. Patent No. 9,015,703. Claim 1 of the present application is substantially
      identical to claim 1 of U.S. Patent No. 9,015,703.  The only difference between
      the claims is the inclusion of the limitation \u201Cwherein the virtual appliance
      event request includes a start virtual appliance request\u201D in claim 1 of
      the present Application. It would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill
      in the art at the time of the invention to include that the event request includes
      a start request. One would be motivated by the desire to ensure compliance upon
      initiation/start events. \\n\\nClaim 1-13 are rejected on the ground of nonstatutory
      double patenting as being unpatentable over claims 1-20 of U.S. Pat Application
      14/691,034. Claim 1 of the present application is substantially identical to
      claim 1 of U.S. Pat Application 14/691,034.  The only difference between the
      claims is the inclusion of the limitation \u201Cwherein the virtual appliance
      event request includes a start virtual appliance request\u201D in claim 1 of
      the present Application. It would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill
      in the art at the time of the invention to include that the event request includes

      226, 228-232, 266-268, and 281-282 is/are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being
      unpatentable over Miles, US 4,087,248 in view of Arnold et al., US 2003/0129089.\\nMiles
      discloses an assembly as shown in Figure 5 that comprises two sheets 116 vertically
      spaced from each other. Each of the sheets comprises a respective array of holes.
      There is an array of pipette tips 90 in each of the two sheets. \\nIn addition
      to the holes for the tips a plurality of smaller holes are provided which are
      similarly spaced to the larger holes between the larger holes. In this way,
      the tips can be stacked with the smaller ends of the tips contained in the smaller
      holes, so that one has a staggered (offset, tips in alternation rows) configuration,
      whereby a plurality of tip plates can be mounted one  above the other. A large
      number of tips may then be stored in a relatively small area. (column 8, lines
      26-36). \\nIn FIGS. 5 and 6, the rack may have a plurality of small holes 134
      (voids) arrayed symmetrically in the same manner as the larger tip holding holes
      136. By providing both of these openings, racks of tips may be stacked overlying
      each other, with the small holes orienting and supporting the tips in the next
      upper rack. (column 10, lines 21-27). \\nThe tips 90 are small, with the wall
      thickness sufficient to provide substantial mechanical stability to the tips.
      (column 10, lines 35-37). \\nClearly, the tips have a diameter or effective
      diameter at some point along the length of the tips that is sufficient to allow
      the tips to be interference fit at a junction within the respective holes of
      the respective sheets in which they are inserted. \\nAs to claim 282, the sheets
      116 can be in the container 144/box 146 and the stacked tips can be in a plastic
      bag.  (column 11, lines 58-62).\\nMiles et al. does not disclose the tips as
      comprises ribs including a distal termini in contact with a first surface of
      the sheets. \\nArnold et al. provided with circumferentially spaced axially
      extending ribs 17.  In the embodiment shown, the lower ends of the ribs 17 engage
      the upper face of the support surface 12 of the tip holder 10.\\nIt would have
      been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art before the effective filing
      date of the invention to modify the pipette tips of Miles to include ribs to
      provide further support of the tips on the surfaces of the respective sheets.
      \\n Claims 265 and 274 is/are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable
      over Miles in view of Arnold et al., US 2003/0129089, in further view of Timpson
      et al. US 2008/0240999.\\nTimpson et al. disclose a pipette device comprising:\\na
      tray 5 with a plate (receptacle plate) comprising top 35 and bottom 40 surfaces
      and an array of holes 30 comprising an edge and a reloading tray 120 (sheet)
      including top 140 and bottom 142 surfaces, and an array of holes 130 that receive
      and store pipette tips 10 frictionally fit into the holes 130 and the tips and
      holes 130 are aligned with holes 30.  The bottom surface of the loading tray
      is placed in contact with the upper surface of the plate of the tray 5 and the
      pipette tips extend through the array of holes in the plate and sheet. (Figures
      5-6; paragraphs 0044-48).\\nThe transfer tray 5 receives a pipette tip 10 in
      an aperture 30 that passes from the upper surface 35 of the transfer tray 5
      through to the lower surface 40 of the transfer tray 5. The aperture 30 has
      an upper opening 45 in the upper surface 35 of the transfer tray 5 that is configured
      to receive a pipette tip 10. The upper opening 45 in this example, as better
      seen in FIG. 2, is substantially square shaped with a rounded fillet 56. The
      fillet 56 (flexible sheet) provides a measure of stress reduction around the
      upper opening 45 and aids in reducing the likelihood of cracking and fracturing
      around the upper opening 45. The upper opening 45 has a length 52 and width
      54 that are greater than the outer diameter of the second end 25 of the pipette
      tip 10. In the illustration, the length 52 and width 54 are less than the diameter
      20 of the first end 15 of the pipette tip 10, although other lengths 52 and
      widths 54 that are substantially the same as or greater than the diameter 20
      of the first end 15 of the pipette tip  10 fall are embodied within the scope
      of the invention. (paragraph 00037).  Furthermore, Timpson discloses the aperture
      30 may be conical in shape with a continuous change in length 52 and width 54
      to diameter 65 over the height 58 rather than having a substantially constant
      length 52 and width 54 over the height 58 with a discrete change to diameter
      65 at the lower opening 60. (paragraph 0037).\\nThe device including the trays
      can be manufactured from various kinds of plastic. (claim 247). \\nThe tray
      120 (sheet), including the holes, elastically deforms.\\n Claims 268-269 and
      273-281 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable over the modified
      teachings of Miles and Arnold as applied to claim 226 above, and further in
      view of Williams et al., US 2012/0257953 or Motadel et al., US 8,798,606. (Motadel
      et al. \u2018606).\\nThe modified teachings of Timpson do not specify the holes/voids
      being any other shape, but does specify that other components can be manufactured
      to be different non-circular shapes. (paragraph 0104).\\nWilliams et al. disclose
      container/rack 60 including a tray 10 (sheet) includes opposing end-walls and
      opposing sidewalls 12 and a planar deck 14 having a longitudinal dimension (arrow
      16) and a lateral dimension (arrow 18). The deck 14 includes a first set of
      apertures having a first size or shape that is configured to receive the shaft
      20 (FIG. 4) of a pipette tip 22 (FIG. 4) (\\\"shaft apertures\\\" 24). The pipette
      tips 22 may be of any desired size, but are particularly illustrated in FIGS.
      1-7. (paragraph 0021).\\nIn one embodiment, the shaft apertures 24 and the tip
      apertures 34 are both circular, with the tip apertures 34 (holes/voids) having

      ACTION\\nThe present application, filed on or after March 16, 2013, is being
      examined under the first inventor to file provisions of the AIA .\\nResponse
      to Arguments\\nApplicant\u2019s arguments, see remarks/amendments, filed March
      28, 2019, with respect to the rejection(s) of claim(s) have been fully considered
      and are persuasive.  Therefore, the rejection has been withdrawn.  However,
      upon further consideration, a new ground(s) of rejection is made.\\nIt is noted
      that applicant has extensively amended the claims such that the scope of such
      claims is different from that previously examined. \\nIt is noted that the amended
      the claims do not require the first and second sheets (nor structure of the
      sheets) to be structurally connected. It is noted that the claims are directed
      to an apparatus. However, it is unclear how two sheets including respective
      pipette tips as claimed form a single apparatus because the respective sheets
      and pipettes are not structurally connected. The claim as drafted recites that
      second sheet is \u201Cdistal to\u201D the first sheet (spaced apart by some
      unknown distance and not structurally connected). The \u201Cdistal to\u201D
      phrase nor any other portion of the claims provide for any structural connection
      between the respective sheets (nor respective components of the respective first
      and second sheets). There is no structure that connects the two sheets nor supports
      the sheet in a single apparatus. There is no description of the first sheet
      having the ability to be present over the second sheet without the sheets being
      supported by some something, hand or structure such as a frame, housing, etc.
      or components of the respective sheets being connected or in some type of contact.
      \ The first  sheet alone does not have the ability to float, hover, etc. in
      air over the second sheet (and components thereof); nor can the second sheet
      float, hover, etc. in air. It appears as if applicant is intending claim a vertical
      stack; wherein a bottom surface of the first sheet is on, in contact with, and
      supported by top surface ends (presumptively, surfaces of proximal termini)
      of the array pipette tips in second sheet. If so, then the claim should clearly
      provide such. Otherwise, the claim as drafted is directed to two structurally
      unconnected sheets (and respective components of each sheet) that can possibly
      be used with each other.   As noted above, unconnected structures do not define
      a single apparatus. Therefore, the claims are directed to new matter. If applicant
      disagrees, it hereby requested that applicant specify where the apparatus as
      currently claimed is disclosed within the originally filed specification.  \\nAs
      to claims 228-232, in view of the amendments, it appears as if the claims should
      read as \u201Cthe corresponding hole edge\u201D. \\nSpecification\\nThe lengthy
      specification has not been checked to the extent necessary to determine the
      presence of all possible minor errors. Applicant\u2019s cooperation is requested
      in correcting any errors of which applicant may become aware in the specification.\\nAs
      to claim 282, it is noted that the claim does not specify how the unconnected
      first and second sheets are structurally arranged within the container. \\nClaim
      Interpretation\\nIt is noted that an interference fit is not structure, but
      is directed to what can be achieved between the pipette tips and holes of the
      sheet. \\nDrawings \\nThe drawings are objected to under 37 CFR 1.83(a).  The
      drawings must show every feature of the invention specified in the claims.  Therefore,
      the first and second sheets contained within a container (claim 282) must be
      shown or the feature(s) canceled from the claim(s).  No new matter should be
      entered.\\nCorrected drawing sheets in compliance with 37 CFR 1.121(d) are required
      in reply to the Office action to avoid abandonment of the application. Any amended
      replacement drawing sheet should include all of the figures appearing on the
      immediate prior version of the sheet, even if only one figure is being amended.
      The figure or figure number of an amended drawing should not be labeled as \u201Camended.\u201D
      If a drawing figure is to be canceled, the appropriate figure must be removed
      from the replacement sheet, and where necessary, the remaining figures must
      be renumbered and appropriate changes made to the brief description of the several
      views of the drawings for consistency. Additional replacement sheets may be
      necessary to show the renumbering of the remaining figures. Each drawing sheet
      submitted after the filing date of an application must be labeled in the top
      margin as either \u201CReplacement Sheet\u201D or \u201CNew Sheet\u201D pursuant
      to 37 CFR 1.121(d). If the changes are not accepted by the examiner, the applicant
      will be notified and informed of any required corrective action in the next
      Office action. The objection to the drawings will not be held in abeyance.\\nClaim

      It appears to be intend to reference the corresponding hole edge. It is further
      unclear how the outer diameter of the pipette tips can be equal to the diameter
      of the holes and in contact with the holes by a certain amount as claimed. \\nClaim
      Rejections - 35 USC \xA7 103\\nThe text of those sections of Title 35, U.S.
      Code not included in this action can be found in a prior Office action.\\nClaim
      226, 228-232, 266-268, and 281-282 is/are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being
      unpatentable over Miles, US 4,087,248 in view of Arnold et al., US 2003/0129089.\\nMiles
      discloses an assembly as shown in Figure 5 that comprises two sheets 116 vertically
      spaced from each other. Each of the sheets comprises a respective array of holes.
      There is an array of pipette tips 90 in each of the two sheets. \\nIn addition
      to the holes for the tips a plurality of smaller holes are provided which are
      similarly spaced to the larger holes between the larger holes. In this way,
      the tips can be stacked with the smaller ends of the tips contained in the smaller
      holes, so that one has a staggered (offset, tips in alternation rows) configuration,
      whereby a plurality of tip plates can be mounted one  above the other. A large
      number of tips may then be stored in a relatively small area. (column 8, lines
      26-36). \\nIn FIGS. 5 and 6, the rack may have a plurality of small holes 134
      (voids) arrayed symmetrically in the same manner as the larger tip holding holes
      136. By providing both of these openings, racks of tips may be stacked overlying
      each other, with the small holes orienting and supporting the tips in the next
      upper rack. (column 10, lines 21-27). \\nThe tips 90 are small, with the wall
      thickness sufficient to provide substantial mechanical stability to the tips.
      (column 10, lines 35-37). \\nClearly, the tips have a diameter or effective
      diameter at some point along the length of the tips that is sufficient to allow
      the tips to be interference fit at a junction within the respective holes of
      the respective sheets in which they are inserted. \\nAs to claim 282, the sheets
      116 can be in the container 144/box 146 and the stacked tips can be in a plastic
      bag.  (column 11, lines 58-62).\\nMiles et al. does not disclose the tips as
      comprises ribs including a distal termini in contact with a first surface of
      the sheets. \\nArnold et al. provided with circumferentially spaced axially
      extending ribs 17.  In the embodiment shown, the lower ends of the ribs 17 engage
      the upper face of the support surface 12 of the tip holder 10.\\nIt would have
      been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art before the effective filing
      date of the invention to modify the pipette tips of Miles to include ribs to
      provide further support of the tips on the surfaces of the respective sheets.
      \\nClaims 265 and 274 is/are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable
      over Miles in view of Arnold et al., US 2003/0129089, in further view of Timpson
      et al. US 2008/0240999.\\nTimpson et al. disclose a pipette device comprising:\\na
      tray 5 with a plate (receptacle plate) comprising top 35 and bottom 40 surfaces
      and an array of holes 30 comprising an edge and a reloading tray 120 (sheet)
      including top 140 and bottom 142 surfaces, and an array of holes 130 that receive
      and store pipette tips 10 frictionally fit into the holes 130 and the tips and
      holes 130 are aligned with holes 30.  The bottom surface of the loading tray
      is placed in contact with the upper surface of the plate of the tray 5 and the
      pipette tips extend through the array of holes in the plate and sheet. (Figures
      5-6; paragraphs 0044-48).\\nThe transfer tray 5 receives a pipette tip 10 in
      an aperture 30 that passes from the upper surface 35 of the transfer tray 5
      through to the lower surface 40 of the transfer tray 5. The aperture 30 has
      an upper opening 45 in the upper surface 35 of the transfer tray 5 that is configured
      to receive a pipette tip 10. The upper opening 45 in this example, as better
      seen in FIG. 2, is substantially square shaped with a rounded fillet 56. The
      fillet 56 (flexible sheet) provides a measure of stress reduction around the
      upper opening 45 and aids in reducing the likelihood of cracking and fracturing
      around the upper opening 45. The upper opening 45 has a length 52 and width
      54 that are greater than the outer diameter of the second end 25 of the pipette
      tip 10. In the illustration, the length 52 and width 54 are less than the diameter
      20 of the first end 15 of the pipette tip 10, although other lengths 52 and
      widths 54 that are substantially the same as or greater than the diameter 20
      of the first end 15 of the pipette tip  10 fall are embodied within the scope
      of the invention. (paragraph 00037).  Furthermore, Timpson discloses the aperture
      30 may be conical in shape with a continuous change in length 52 and width 54
      to diameter 65 over the height 58 rather than having a substantially constant
      length 52 and width 54 over the height 58 with a discrete change to diameter
      65 at the lower opening 60. (paragraph 0037).\\nThe device including the trays
      can be manufactured from various kinds of plastic. (claim 247). \\nThe tray
      120 (sheet), including the holes, elastically deforms.\\nClaims 268-269 and
      273-281 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable over the modified
      teachings of Miles and Arnold as applied to claim 226 above, and further in
      view of Williams et al., US 2012/0257953 or Motadel et al., US 8,798,606. (Motadel
      et al. \u2018606).\\nThe modified teachings of Timpson do not specify the holes/voids
      being any other shape, but does specify that other components can be manufactured
      to be different non-circular shapes. (paragraph 0104).\\nWilliams et al. disclose
      container/rack 60 including a tray 10 (sheet) includes opposing end-walls and
      opposing sidewalls 12 and a planar deck 14 having a longitudinal dimension (arrow
      16) and a lateral dimension (arrow 18). The deck 14 includes a first set of
      apertures having a first size or shape that is configured to receive the shaft
      20 (FIG. 4) of a pipette tip 22 (FIG. 4) (\\\"shaft apertures\\\" 24). The pipette
      tips 22 may be of any desired size, but are particularly illustrated in FIGS.
      1-7. (paragraph 0021).\\nIn one embodiment, the shaft apertures 24 and the tip
      apertures 34 are both circular, with the tip apertures 34 (holes/voids) having
      a smaller diameter than the diameters of the  shaft apertures 24. Alternatively,
      the tip apertures 34 may have a different shape or configuration as compared
      to the shape or configuration of the shaft apertures 24. For example, and by
      way of illustration only, the shaft apertures 24 may be circular in shape while
      the tip apertures 34 may be formed in the shape of a diamond, triangle, oval,
      cross or any other suitable different shape for receiving the distal tip ends
      32 of the pipette tips 22. (paragraph 0025; Figures 1-9).  The tray 10 may be
      molded as a unitary structure from a suitable polymeric material. (paragraph
      0029). \\nMotadel et al. \u2018606 discloses a tip card device including apertures,
      protrusions, depressions and channel cross sections that can be of any suitable
      shape (e.g., circular, annular, ovoid, rectangular, square, rhomboid and the
      like). (column 8, lines 65-67). \\nIt would have been within the common sense,
      routine skill, of predictable results, and an obvious matter of design choice
      before the effective filing date of the claimed invention to manufacture the
      plate to include non-circular holes and voids as taught by Williams et al. and
      Motadel et al. \u2018606 via conventional known processes such as molding and
      cutting that would allow one to produce a plastic/polymer structure including
      non-circular holes/voids.\\nClaims 270-281 is/are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103
      as being unpatentable over Miles in view of Arnold et al., US 2003/0129089 in
      view of Timpson et al. US 2008/0240999 as applied above, in view of Motadel,
      US 2010/0089938; US 2009/0255949; US 8,460,622.\\nTimpson et al does not disclose
      a thickness value as claimed.\\nMotadel disclose pipette tip device comprising
      loading block 26 (rack); \\na plate having upper and lower surfaces fixed to
      the block that includes channels 34; (Figures 1, 4, 5, 8).\\n a plate 28 (sheet)
      includes a plurality of the restrictive apertures 32 (holes) in an array; and
      \\nan array of pipette tips retained in the holes of the sheet 28.\\nthe barrier
      plate 28 may be made from suitable metal, such as aluminum, or polymers such
      as polypropylene, polycarbonate, polyethylene, polystyrene, polyurethane and
      the like as well as any other suitable polymers that may be molded, thermoformed
      or the like. (paragraph 071). The device further includes other structures that
      could be employed for alignment, including an alignment housing 12. (paragraph
      0062-0063).\\nMotadel discloses restrictive apertures and proximal alignment
      members having regular spacing about 9 mm. (paragraph 0015). The barrier plate
      28 may have a thickness of about 0.05 inches to about 0.3 inches, more specifically,
      about 0.1 inches to about 0.25 inches. (paragraph 071)\\nIn certain embodiments,
      pipette tips in a pipette tray comprise one or more of a filter component and/or
      an insert component. A filter (internal filter) may be located in any suitable
      portion of a pipette tip, and sometimes is located in a proximal portion of
      a pipette tip near a pipette tip aperture that can engage a dispensing device.
      A filter can be of any shape (e.g., plug, disk; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,156,811 and
      7,335,337) and can be manufactured from any material that impedes or blocks
      migration of aerosol through the pipette tip to the proximal section terminus,
      including without limitation, polyester, cork, plastic, silica, gels, and the
      like, and combinations thereof.  (claim 248)\\nIt would have been within the
      common sense, routine skill, of predictable results, and an obvious matter of
      design choice before the effective filing date of the claimed invention to  manufacture
      the plate to have a thickness within the claimed range for conventional known
      processes such as molding and cutting would allow one to produce a plastic/polymer
      structure of such a thickness, since such a modification would have involved
      a mere change in the size of a component.  A change in size is generally recognized
      as being within the level of ordinary skill in the art.\\nAs to claims 276-281,
      Miles discloses each of the features as seen in the figures. The total number
      of holes in each sheet 116 is greater than the total number of pipette tips
      in respective first and second sets of holes at different locations, all the
      holes do not include pipette tips, but yet extend through holes in the second
      sheet. \\nConclusion\\nApplicant's amendment necessitated the new ground(s)
      of rejection presented in this Office action.  Accordingly, THIS ACTION IS MADE
      FINAL.  See MPEP \xA7 706.07(a).  Applicant is reminded of the extension of
      time policy as set forth in 37 CFR 1.136(a).  \\nA shortened statutory period
      for reply to this final action is set to expire THREE MONTHS from the mailing
      date of this action.  In the event a first reply is filed within TWO MONTHS
      of the mailing date of this final action and the advisory action is not mailed
      until after the end of the THREE-MONTH shortened statutory period, then the
      shortened statutory period will expire on the date the advisory action is mailed,

      over Lofstrand (US 20110158088) in view of Harvey (US 20030177208).\\nRegarding
      claims 1, 11, and 16 Lofstrand teaches a method, comprising: receiving Dynamic
      Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) information that comprises a filename and
      location of a script file [0022, 0024];\\n downloading the script file from
      a script server in a network environment [0018]; and \\nexecuting the script
      file [0023], wherein the executing includes: \\ncopying a configuration file
      and one or more to a memory element a switch [0023, 0024, 0046], wherein the
      configuration file includes configuration settings relevant to at least a switch

      file [0021].\\nLofstrand does not explicitly indicate software images and applying
      configuration settings from the configuration file to the software.\\nHarvey
      teaches the switch 105 may download an upgraded software image 145b (from target
      server 110) to the switch 105 by use of TFTP [0024]. The automatic TFTP protocol
      permits configuration files and software to be download from the target server
      110 to the switch 105 [0019]. Both the switch 105 and the target server 110
      can handle the automatic TFTP protocol to permit software and configuration
      download from the target server 110 to the switch 105 [0021].\\nIt would have
      been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of invention to
      use Harvey retrieving a software image from the target file to improve on Lofstrand's
      system as to allow Lofstrand's system capture a server image to minimized or
      optimized version of the boot settings/configurations normally used to boot
      the  designated server, along with relevant software which is used to capture
      the desired image of the designated server, for use thereof in the referenced
      migration, cloning or other provisioning-related management functionalities.
      \\nRegarding claim 2 Lofstrand teaches the method of Claim 1, further comprising
      discovering neighbors of the switch in the network environment [0019, 0039].
      \\nRegarding claims 3, 15 and 20 Lofstrand teaches the method of Claim 1, further
      comprising generating a log file indicative of a status of activation of the
      switch [0020, service register]. \\nRegarding claims 5, 13 and 18 Lofstrand
      teaches the method of Claim 1, wherein the script file is configurable to specify
      a method of copying the configuration file and the one or more software images
      0046].\\nRegarding claims 6, 14 and 19 Lofstrand teaches the method of Claim
      1, wherein the configuration file can be specified in the script file according
      to at least one of a static filename [0018], a location of a network element
      hosting the configuration file [0043], and a serial number associated with the
      switch [0045].\\n Regarding claim 7 Lofstrand teaches the method of Claim 6,
      wherein the serial number corresponds to a unique identifier of the switch [0045],
      and wherein the filename of the configuration file includes the serial number
      [0018].\\nRegarding claim 9 Harvey teaches the method of Claim 1, wherein the
      script file is downloaded by at least one protocol from a group consisting of
      file transfer protocol (FTP), secure file transfer protocol (SFTP), trivial
      file transfer protocol (TFTP) [0047], and hyper text transfer protocol (HTTP)

      view of Winters (US 20120233348).\\nRegarding claim 8 Lofstrand teaches the
      method of Claim 1, wherein the configuration file can be specified in the script
      file to be split into a first part and a second part, wherein the first part
      includes configuration settings that are activated upon a reboot of the switch.\\nWinters
      teaches The download manager can automatically change the mode of download from
      a first mode to a second mode, if the timeout option acknowledgement is received
      and the mode of download is set to a first mode or automatically change the
      mode of download from a second mode to a first mode, if the timeout option  acknowledgement
      is not received and the mode of download is set to a second mode [0009].\\n
      It would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the
      invention was made to use Winters dual-mode download manager to improve on Lofstrand\u2019s
      system as to allow Lofstrand\u2019s system to arrange setting after the system
      restarts. \\n Claims 4, 12 and 17 are rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a)

      20030177208) in further view of  Rathi (US 7568107). \\nRegarding claims 4,
      12 and 17 Lofstrand teaches the method of Claim 1, wherein the DHCP information
      is received in a DHCP offer message in response to a DHCP discover message broadcast
      by the switch at an interface [0017]. \\nLofstrand does not explicitly teach
      activated in a non-forwarding mode.\\nRathi teaches Non-forwarding mode 170
      causes the packet forwarder 160 to block packets to and from the port [col.
      6 lines 54-55]. Non-forwarding mode 170, which prevents the packet forwarder
      160 from forwarding packets for the user connected through port 205 on user
      device 211 of VLAN 210 [col. 7 lines 18-20].\\nIt would have been obvious to
      one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to use Rathi
      non-forwarding mode to improve on Lofstrand\u2019s  system as to allow Lofstrand\u2019s
      system prevents deception of access equipment and effectively avoid excess equipment
      migrates.\\n Claim 10 is rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable
      over Lofstrand (US 20110158088) in view of Harvey (US 20030177208) in further
      view Mangtani (US 20130232498).\\nRegarding claim 10 Lofstrand does not explicitly
      indicate the method of Claim 1, further comprising verifying integrity of the
      script file using an MD5 sum of the script file.\\nMangtani teaches VM 114.sub.1
      receives the deployment agent package and verifies the integrity and/or authenticity
      of the deployment package, for example, using a fingerprint or checksum value
      (e.g., MD5 hash value) that is provided with deployment agent configurations
      in step 810.  VM 114.sub.1 executes the deployment agent package to launch deployment
      agent 726 utilizing received deployment agent configurations [0084].\\n It would
      have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention
      was made to use Mangtani's checksum value involving valuating the authenticity
      of the deployment package to improve on Lofstrand\u2019s system, as to allow
      Lofstrand\u2019s system to indicate the actions that should be taken to retrieve
      data from this device.\\n\"],\n        \"sections.submissionDate\":\"2015-05-15T04:00:00Z\",\n

      1-24,26-28 is/are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable over Klassen(EP2452574A1).\\nRegarding
      claim 1, Klassen teaches an array of infant formula for providing an age-tailored
      nutrition system to an infant, comprising a first infant formula for infants
      \ between 0 to 100 days, i.e 0 to 4 weeks(0 to 28 days), and a second infant
      formula between 3 to 6 months(90 to 180 days)(paragraph 34-37). Please note
      that Klassen refers to the second infant formula(the 90 to 180 day month formula)
      as a \u201Cthird composition\u201D throughout the disclosure and the examples.\\n
      Klassen teaches that the protein content in the second infant formula is lower
      than in the first infant formula(paragraphs 57 and 58) and the lactose content
      in the second infant formula is higher than in the first infant formula(example
      1). \\nKlassen teaches that the first and second formulas comprise calcium,
      iodine, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, copper and zinc(paragraphs 69 and 70).
      \\n\\tKlassen teaches that the first formula has an iodine content of 15 to
      20\xB5g/kcal and the second formula has an iodine content of 15\xB5g/kcal. \\n\\tKlassen
      teaches that the first formula has a potassium content of 80 to 95mg/100kcal
      and second formula has a potassium content of 80mg/100kcal(example 1).\\n\\tKlassen
      teaches that the first formula has a sodium content of 25 to 37.5mg/100kcal
      and the second formula has a sodium content of 25mg/100kcal.\\n\\tKlassen teaches
      that the first formula has a copper content of 60 to 80\xB5g/100kcal and the
      second formula has a copper content of 50\xB5g/100kcal.\\n\\tKlassen teaches
      that the first formula has a zinc content of 1 to 1.2mg/100kcal and the second
      formula has a zinc content of 0.6mg/100kcal.\\n\\tTherefore, the contents of
      iodine, potassium, sodium, copper, and zinc in the second formula are all lower
      than the contents of these minerals in the first formula.\\n \\t Klassen does
      not specifically teach that the calcium or phosphorus content in the second
      formula is lower than the content in the first formula. However, it would have
      been obvious to adjust the calcium and/or phosphorus content of the formula
      depending on the nutritional needs of the intended infant, for example, if a
      special diet was required.\\nKlassen teaches administering the first formula
      to an infant from 0 to 4 weeks(0 to 28 days) and the second formula to an infant
      from 3 to 6 months(90 to 180 days). Klassen teaches administering the first
      and second formulas reduces the risk of obesity and diabetes later in life(paragraphs
      20-22).\\nRegarding claims 2,20, Klassen teaches that the first infant formula
      has a protein content of 1.8 to 2.25g/100kcal(paragraph 57) and a lactose content
      of 10.1g/100kcal(example 1). The second formula comprises a protein content
      of 2g/kcal(paragraph 57) and a lactose content of 11.6g/kcal(example 1). Therefore,
      the protein content of the second formula is lower than the protein content
      of the first composition.\\n\\tKlassen teaches that the first and second formulas
      comprise whey and casein proteins. The first formula has a whey:casein ratio
      of 70:30 and the second formula has a whey:casein ratio of 50:50(paragraph 57).
      \\n\\tRegarding claim 3, Klassen teaches that that first infant formula comprises
      an energy density of 67kcal/100ml and the second infant formula comprises an
      energy density of 63kcal/100ml(example 1). Therefore, the second formula has
      a lower energy density than the first formula. \\n \\tRegarding claim 4, Klassen
      teaches that the first infant formula has a fat content of 5.64g/100kcal and
      the second infant formula has a fat content of 5.11g/100kcal(example 1).\\n\\tRegarding
      claims 5,6,9.11,12,14 Klassen teaches that the first and second formulas comprise
      calcium, iodine, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, copper and zinc(paragraphs 69
      and 70, example 2). \\n\\tIn example 2, Klassen teaches that the first formula
      has an iodine content of 15 to 20\xB5g/kcal and the second formula has an iodine
      content of 15\xB5g/kcal. \\n\\tKlassen teaches that the first formula has a
      potassium content of 80 to 95mg/100kcal and second formula has a potassium content
      of 80mg/100kcal.\\n\\tKlassen teaches that the first formula has a sodium content
      of 25 to 37.5mg/100kcal and the second formula has a sodium content of 25mg/100kcal.\\n\\tKlassen
      teaches that the first formula has a copper content of 60 to 80\xB5g/100kcal
      and the second formula has a copper content of 50\xB5g/100kcal.\\n\\tKlassen
      teaches that the first formula has a zinc content of 1 to 1.2mg/100kcal and
      the second formula has a zinc content of 0.6mg/100kcal.\\n\\tTherefore, the
      contents of iodine, potassium, sodium, copper, and zinc in the second formula
      are all lower than the contents of these minerals in the first formula. \\nRegarding
      claims 7,8,10,15, Klassen teaches that the first and second formulas comprise
      calcium, iodine, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, copper and zinc(paragraphs 69
      and 70). \\n\\tKlassen teaches that the first formula has an iodine content
      of 15 to 20\xB5g/kcal and the second formula has an iodine content of 15\xB5g/kcal.
      \\n \\tKlassen teaches that the first formula has a potassium content of 80
      to 95mg/100kcal and second formula has a potassium content of 80mg/100kcal(example
      1).\\n\\tKlassen teaches that the first formula has a sodium content of 25 to
      37.5mg/100kcal and the second formula has a sodium content of 25mg/100kcal.\\n\\tKlassen
      teaches that the first formula has a copper content of 60 to 80\xB5g/100kcal
      and the second formula has a copper content of 50\xB5g/100kcal.\\n\\tKlassen
      teaches that the first formula has a zinc content of 1 to 1.2mg/100kcal and
      the second formula has a zinc content of 0.6mg/100kcal.\\n\\tTherefore, the
      contents of iodine, potassium, sodium, copper, and zinc in the second formula
      are all lower than the contents of these minerals in the first formula.\\n \\tKlassen
      does not specifically teach the phosphorus content as recited in claim 10 or
      that the phosphorus content in the second formula is lower than the content
      in the first formula. However, it would have been obvious to adjust the phosphorus
      content of the formula depending on the nutritional needs of the intended infant,
      for example, if a special diet with increased was required. \\n Klassen does
      not specifically teach the calcium content as recited in claim 15 or that the
      calcium content in the second formula is lower than the content in the first
      formula. However, it would have been obvious to adjust the calcium content of
      the formula depending on the nutritional needs of the intended infant, for example,
      if a special diet was required.\\nRegarding claim 13, Klassen teaches that the
      first formula has a copper content of 60 to 80\xB5g/100kcal and the second formula
      has a copper content of 50\xB5g/100kcal.  The amount in the second formula is
      slightly lower than the claimed 62 to 55ug/100kcal. However, it would have been
      obvious to adjust the copper content of the formula depending on the nutritional
      needs of the intended infant, for example, if a special diet was required.\\nRegarding
      claim 16, Klassen does not specifically teach the ratio of calcium to phosphorus
      as claimed. However, it would have been obvious to adjust the calcium to phosphorus
      content of the formula depending on the nutritional needs of the intended infant,
      for example, if a special diet was required.\\n\\tRegarding claim 17, Klassen
      teaches that the first and second formula comprises long-chain polyunsaturated
      fatty acids such as DHA and ARA(paragraph 46).\\n\\tRegarding claims 18 and
      19, Klassen teaches that the first and second formulas can comprise the probiotic
      L.paracasei ST11 CNCM I-2116(paragraph 85).\\n\\tRegarding claim 21, Klassen
      teaches that the first and second formulas are in powder form to be reconstituted
      with a liquid(paragraph 33). \\n\\tRegarding claims 22 and 23, Klassen teaches
      that the first and second formulas are packaged in single dose units, preferably
      capsules, to prepare a single dose serving upon reconstitution in water(paragraph
      23).\\nRegarding claims 24,26,27, Klassen teaches an array of infant formula
      for providing an age-tailored nutrition system to an infant, comprising a first
      infant formula for infants between 0 to 100 days, i.e 0 to 4 weeks(0 to 28 days),
      and a second infant formula between 3 to 6 months(90 to 180 days)(paragraph
      34-37). Please note that number='10'Klassen refers to the second infant formula(the
      90 to 180 day month formula) as a \u201Cthird composition\u201D throughout the
      disclosure and the examples.\\n Klassen teaches that the protein content in
      the second infant formula is lower than in the first infant formula(paragraphs
      57 and 58) and the lactose content in the second infant formula is higher than
      in the first infant formula(example 1). \\nKlassen teaches that the first and
      second formulas comprise calcium, iodine, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, copper
      and zinc(paragraphs 69 and 70). \\n\\tKlassen teaches that the first formula
      has an iodine content of 15 to 20\xB5g/kcal and the second formula has an iodine
      content of 15\xB5g/kcal. \\n\\tKlassen teaches that the first formula has a
      potassium content of 80 to 95mg/100kcal and second formula has a potassium content
      of 80mg/100kcal(example 1).\\n\\tKlassen teaches that the first formula has
      a sodium content of 25 to 37.5mg/100kcal and the second formula has a sodium
      content of 25mg/100kcal.\\n\\tKlassen teaches that the first formula has a copper
      content of 60 to 80\xB5g/100kcal and the second formula has a copper content
      of 50\xB5g/100kcal.\\n\\tKlassen teaches that the first formula has a zinc content
      of 1 to 1.2mg/100kcal and the second formula has a zinc content of 0.6mg/100kcal.\\n\\tTherefore,
      the contents of iodine, potassium, sodium, copper, and zinc in the second formula
      are all lower than the contents of these minerals in the first formula.\\n\\t
      Klassen does not specifically teach that the calcium or phosphorus content in
      the second formula is lower than the content in the first formula. However,
      it would have been obvious to adjust the calcium and/or phosphorus content of
      the formula depending number='11'on the nutritional needs of the intended infant,
      for example, if a special diet was required.\\nKlassen teaches administering
      the first formula to an infant from 0 to 4 weeks(0 to 28 days) and the second
      formula to an infant from 3 to 6 months(90 to 180 days). Klassen teaches administering
      the first and second formulas reduces the risk of obesity and diabetes later
      in life(paragraphs 20-22).\\n\\tKlassen teaches administering the formula to
      infants in the general population which would presumably include \u201CAsian
      infants.\u201D Also, according to the 112 rejection, the applicant has not provided
      any additional limitations with the term \u201CAsian infant\u201D that would
      differentiate the claimed formula from the prior art. Therefore, since Klassen
      renders obvious the claimed infant formula array, the infant formula array would
      be suitable for an \u201CAsian\u201D infant as claimed. \\nRegarding claim 28,
      Klassen teaches an array of infant formula for providing an age-tailored nutrition
      system to an infant, comprising a first infant formula for infants between 0
      to 3 months, i.e 0 to 4 weeks(0 to 28 days), and a second infant formula between
      3 to 6 months(90 to 180 days), and a third infant formula between 7 and 12 months(210
      days to 1 year)(paragraphs 34-37) . Please note that Klassen refers to the second
      infant formula(the 3 to 6 month formula) as a \u201Cthird composition\u201D
      and the third infant formula(the 7 to 12 month formula) as a \u201Cfourth composition\u201D
      throughout the disclosure and the examples(paragraphs 34-37).\\n Klassen teaches
      that the protein content in the second infant formula is lower than in the first
      infant formula(paragraphs 57 and 58) and the lactose content in the second infant
      formula is higher than in the first infant formula(example 1). The protein number='12'content
      in the third infant formula is lower than in the second formula and the lactose
      content in the third infant formula is higher than the second formula(example
      2). \\n\\t Klassen does not specifically teach that the calcium or phosphorus
      content in the second formula is lower than the content in the first formula.
      However, it would have been obvious to adjust the calcium and/or phosphorus
      content of the formula depending on the nutritional needs of the intended infant,
      for example, if a special diet was required.\\n\"],\n        \"sections.section112RejectionFormParagraphText\":[\"The

      26-28 provisionally rejected on the ground of nonstatutory double patenting
      as being unpatentable over claims 1-24,26-28 of copending Application No. 15103955.Although
      the claims at issue are not identical, they are not patentably distinct from
      each other because the limitations of the present application are all disclosed
      in the \u2018955 reference application. The only slight difference between the
      applications is that the present application recites an infant age of 0 to 100
      days and 100 to 180 days. whereas the \u2018955 reference application recites
      an infant age of 0 to 3 months and 3 to 6 months. However, the time periods
      as recited in the reference application overlap the time periods in the present
      application and render them obvious.\\n This is a provisional nonstatutory double
      patenting rejection because the patentably indistinct claims have not in fact
      been patented.\\n\\n\\n\\tClaim Rejections - 35 USC \xA7 103\\nThe following
      is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 103 which forms the basis for all obviousness rejections
      set forth in this Office action:\\nA patent for a claimed invention may not
      be obtained, notwithstanding that the claimed invention is not identically disclosed
      as set forth in section 102, if the differences between the claimed invention
      and the prior art are such that the claimed invention as a whole would have
      been obvious before the effective filing date of the claimed invention to a
      person having ordinary skill in the art to which the claimed invention pertains.
      Patentability shall not be negated by the manner in which the invention was
      made.\\n\\nThe factual inquiries set forth in Graham v. John Deere Co., 383
      U.S. 1, 148 USPQ 459 (1966), that are applied for establishing a background
      for determining obviousness under 35 U.S.C. 103 are summarized as follows:\\n1.
      Determining the scope and contents of the prior art.\\n2. Ascertaining the differences
      between the prior art and the claims at issue.\\n3. Resolving the level of ordinary
      skill in the pertinent art.\\n4. Considering objective evidence present in the
      application indicating obviousness or nonobviousness.\\nClaims 1-24,26-28 is/are
      rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable over Klassen(EP2452574A1).\\n\\nRegarding
      claim 1, Klassen teaches an array of infant formula for providing an age-tailored
      nutrition system to an infant, comprising a first infant formula for infants
      \ between 0 to 100 days, i.e 0 to 4 weeks(0 to 28 days), and a second infant
      formula between 3 to 6 months(90 to 180 days)(paragraph 34-37). Please note
      that Klassen refers to the second infant formula(the 90 to 180 day month formula)
      as a \u201Cthird composition\u201D throughout the disclosure and the examples.\\n
      Klassen teaches that the protein content in the second infant formula is lower
      than in the first infant formula(paragraphs 57 and 58) and the lactose content
      in the second infant formula is higher than in the first infant formula(example
      1). \\nKlassen teaches that the first and second formulas comprise calcium,
      iodine, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, copper and zinc(paragraphs 69 and 70).
      \\n\\tKlassen teaches that the first formula has an iodine content of 15 to
      20\xB5g/kcal and the second formula has an iodine content of 15\xB5g/kcal. \\n\\tKlassen
      teaches that the first formula has a potassium content of 80 to 95mg/100kcal
      and second formula has a potassium content of 80mg/100kcal(example 1).\\n\\tKlassen
      teaches that the first formula has a sodium content of 25 to 37.5mg/100kcal
      and the second formula has a sodium content of 25mg/100kcal.\\n\\tKlassen teaches
      that the first formula has a copper content of 60 to 80\xB5g/100kcal and the
      second formula has a copper content of 50\xB5g/100kcal.\\n\\tKlassen teaches
      that the first formula has a zinc content of 1 to 1.2mg/100kcal and the second
      formula has a zinc content of 0.6mg/100kcal.\\n\\tTherefore, the contents of
      iodine, potassium, sodium, copper, and zinc in the second formula are all lower
      than the contents of these minerals in the first formula.\\n \\t Klassen does
      not specifically teach that the calcium or phosphorus content in the second
      formula is lower than the content in the first formula. However, it would have
      been obvious to adjust the calcium and/or phosphorus content of the formula
      depending on the nutritional needs of the intended infant, for example, if a
      special diet was required.\\nKlassen teaches administering the first formula
      to an infant from 0 to 4 weeks(0 to 28 days) and the second formula to an infant
      from 3 to 6 months(90 to 180 days). Klassen teaches administering the first
      and second formulas reduces the risk of obesity and diabetes later in life(paragraphs
      20-22).\\nRegarding claims 2,20, Klassen teaches that the first infant formula
      has a protein content of 1.8 to 2.25g/100kcal(paragraph 57) and a lactose content
      of 10.1g/100kcal(example 1). The second formula comprises a protein content
      of 2g/kcal(paragraph 57) and a lactose content of 11.6g/kcal(example 1). Therefore,
      the protein content of the second formula is lower than the protein content
      of the first composition.\\n\\tKlassen teaches that the first and second formulas
      comprise whey and casein proteins. The first formula has a whey:casein ratio
      of 70:30 and the second formula has a whey:casein ratio of 50:50(paragraph 57).
      \\n\\tRegarding claim 3, Klassen teaches that that first infant formula comprises
      an energy density of 67kcal/100ml and the second infant formula comprises an
      energy density of 63kcal/100ml(example 1). Therefore, the second formula has
      a lower energy density than the first formula. \\n \\tRegarding claim 4, Klassen
      teaches that the first infant formula has a fat content of 5.64g/100kcal and
      the second infant formula has a fat content of 5.11g/100kcal(example 1).\\n\\tRegarding
      claims 5,6,9.11,12,14 Klassen teaches that the first and second formulas comprise
      calcium, iodine, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, copper and zinc(paragraphs 69
      and 70, example 2). \\n\\tIn example 2, Klassen teaches that the first formula
      has an iodine content of 15 to 20\xB5g/kcal and the second formula has an iodine
      content of 15\xB5g/kcal. \\n\\tKlassen teaches that the first formula has a
      potassium content of 80 to 95mg/100kcal and second formula has a potassium content
      of 80mg/100kcal.\\n\\tKlassen teaches that the first formula has a sodium content
      of 25 to 37.5mg/100kcal and the second formula has a sodium content of 25mg/100kcal.\\n\\tKlassen
      teaches that the first formula has a copper content of 60 to 80\xB5g/100kcal
      and the second formula has a copper content of 50\xB5g/100kcal.\\n\\tKlassen
      teaches that the first formula has a zinc content of 1 to 1.2mg/100kcal and
      the second formula has a zinc content of 0.6mg/100kcal.\\n\\tTherefore, the
      contents of iodine, potassium, sodium, copper, and zinc in the second formula
      are all lower than the contents of these minerals in the first formula. \\nRegarding
      claims 7,8,10,15, Klassen teaches that the first and second formulas comprise
      calcium, iodine, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, copper and zinc(paragraphs 69
      and 70). \\n\\tKlassen teaches that the first formula has an iodine content
      of 15 to 20\xB5g/kcal and the second formula has an iodine content of 15\xB5g/kcal.
      \\n \\tKlassen teaches that the first formula has a potassium content of 80
      to 95mg/100kcal and second formula has a potassium content of 80mg/100kcal(example
      1).\\n\\tKlassen teaches that the first formula has a sodium content of 25 to
      37.5mg/100kcal and the second formula has a sodium content of 25mg/100kcal.\\n\\tKlassen
      teaches that the first formula has a copper content of 60 to 80\xB5g/100kcal
      and the second formula has a copper content of 50\xB5g/100kcal.\\n\\tKlassen
      teaches that the first formula has a zinc content of 1 to 1.2mg/100kcal and
      the second formula has a zinc content of 0.6mg/100kcal.\\n\\tTherefore, the
      contents of iodine, potassium, sodium, copper, and zinc in the second formula
      are all lower than the contents of these minerals in the first formula.\\n\\tKlassen
      does not specifically teach the phosphorus content as recited in claim 10 or
      that the phosphorus content in the second formula is lower than the content
      in the first formula. However, it would have been obvious to adjust the phosphorus
      content of the formula depending on the nutritional needs of the intended infant,
      for example, if a special diet with increased was required. \\nKlassen does
      not specifically teach the calcium content as recited in claim 15 or that the
      calcium content in the second formula is lower than the content in the first
      formula. However, it would have been obvious to adjust the calcium content of
      the formula depending on the nutritional needs of the intended infant, for example,
      if a special diet was required.\\nRegarding claim 13, Klassen teaches that the
      first formula has a copper content of 60 to 80\xB5g/100kcal and the second formula
      has a copper content of 50\xB5g/100kcal.  The amount in the second formula is
      slightly lower than the claimed 62 to 55ug/100kcal. However, it would have been
      obvious to adjust the copper content of the formula depending on the nutritional
      needs of the intended infant, for example, if a special diet was required.\\nRegarding
      claim 16, Klassen does not specifically teach the ratio of calcium to phosphorus
      as claimed. However, it would have been obvious to adjust the calcium to phosphorus
      content of the formula depending on the nutritional needs of the intended infant,
      for example, if a special diet was required.\\n\\n\\tRegarding claim 17, Klassen
      teaches that the first and second formula comprises long-chain polyunsaturated
      fatty acids such as DHA and ARA(paragraph 46).\\n\\tRegarding claims 18 and
      19, Klassen teaches that the first and second formulas can comprise the probiotic
      L.paracasei ST11 CNCM I-2116(paragraph 85).\\n\\tRegarding claim 21, Klassen
      teaches that the first and second formulas are in powder form to be reconstituted
      with a liquid(paragraph 33). \\n\\tRegarding claims 22 and 23, Klassen teaches
      that the first and second formulas are packaged in single dose units, preferably
      capsules, to prepare a single dose serving upon reconstitution in water(paragraph
      23).\\nRegarding claims 24,26,27, Klassen teaches an array of infant formula
      for providing an age-tailored nutrition system to an infant, comprising a first
      infant formula for infants between 0 to 100 days, i.e 0 to 4 weeks(0 to 28 days),
      and a second infant formula between 3 to 6 months(90 to 180 days)(paragraph
      34-37). Please note that number='10'Klassen refers to the second infant formula(the
      90 to 180 day month formula) as a \u201Cthird composition\u201D throughout the
      disclosure and the examples.\\n Klassen teaches that the protein content in
      the second infant formula is lower than in the first infant formula(paragraphs
      57 and 58) and the lactose content in the second infant formula is higher than
      in the first infant formula(example 1). \\nKlassen teaches that the first and
      second formulas comprise calcium, iodine, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, copper
      and zinc(paragraphs 69 and 70). \\n\\tKlassen teaches that the first formula
      has an iodine content of 15 to 20\xB5g/kcal and the second formula has an iodine
      content of 15\xB5g/kcal. \\n\\tKlassen teaches that the first formula has a
      potassium content of 80 to 95mg/100kcal and second formula has a potassium content
      of 80mg/100kcal(example 1).\\n\\tKlassen teaches that the first formula has
      a sodium content of 25 to 37.5mg/100kcal and the second formula has a sodium
      content of 25mg/100kcal.\\n\\tKlassen teaches that the first formula has a copper
      content of 60 to 80\xB5g/100kcal and the second formula has a copper content
      of 50\xB5g/100kcal.\\n\\tKlassen teaches that the first formula has a zinc content
      of 1 to 1.2mg/100kcal and the second formula has a zinc content of 0.6mg/100kcal.\\n\\tTherefore,
      the contents of iodine, potassium, sodium, copper, and zinc in the second formula
      are all lower than the contents of these minerals in the first formula.\\n\\t
      Klassen does not specifically teach that the calcium or phosphorus content in
      the second formula is lower than the content in the first formula. However,
      it would have been obvious to adjust the calcium and/or phosphorus content of
      the formula depending number='11'on the nutritional needs of the intended infant,
      for example, if a special diet was required.\\nKlassen teaches administering
      the first formula to an infant from 0 to 4 weeks(0 to 28 days) and the second
      formula to an infant from 3 to 6 months(90 to 180 days). Klassen teaches administering
      the first and second formulas reduces the risk of obesity and diabetes later
      in life(paragraphs 20-22).\\n\\tKlassen teaches administering the formula to
      infants in the general population which would presumably include \u201CAsian
      infants.\u201D Also, according to the 112 rejection, the applicant has not provided
      any additional limitations with the term \u201CAsian infant\u201D that would
      differentiate the claimed formula from the prior art. Therefore, since Klassen
      renders obvious the claimed infant formula array, the infant formula array would
      be suitable for an \u201CAsian\u201D infant as claimed. \\nRegarding claim 28,
      Klassen teaches an array of infant formula for providing an age-tailored nutrition
      system to an infant, comprising a first infant formula for infants between 0
      to 3 months, i.e 0 to 4 weeks(0 to 28 days), and a second infant formula between
      3 to 6 months(90 to 180 days), and a third infant formula between 7 and 12 months(210
      days to 1 year)(paragraphs 34-37) . Please note that Klassen refers to the second
      infant formula(the 3 to 6 month formula) as a \u201Cthird composition\u201D
      and the third infant formula(the 7 to 12 month formula) as a \u201Cfourth composition\u201D
      throughout the disclosure and the examples(paragraphs 34-37).\\n Klassen teaches
      that the protein content in the second infant formula is lower than in the first
      infant formula(paragraphs 57 and 58) and the lactose content in the second infant
      formula is higher than in the first infant formula(example 1). The protein number='12'content
      in the third infant formula is lower than in the second formula and the lactose
      content in the third infant formula is higher than the second formula(example
      2). \\n\\t Klassen does not specifically teach that the calcium or phosphorus
      content in the second formula is lower than the content in the first formula.
      However, it would have been obvious to adjust the calcium and/or phosphorus
      content of the formula depending on the nutritional needs of the intended infant,
      for example, if a special diet was required.\\n\\nResponse to Arguments\\nApplicant's
      arguments filed 12/14/2018 have been fully considered but they are not persuasive.
      \\n\\n\\tThe applicant argues that it would not have been obvious to adjust
      the amount of calcium and phosphorus. However, the function and dietary role
      of these nutrients are well known in the art. Therefore, it would have been
      obvious to adjust the amount the components in Klassen depending on the nutritional
      needs of the intended infant. As such, the applicant has not shown anything
      unexpected about the amounts of calcium and phosphorus as claimed. \\n\\tIn
      fact, the applicant\u2019s new limitation requiring the formula to be for an
      \u201CAsian\u201D infant reinforces the fact that one can adjust the formula
      components based on the exact nutritional needs of a particular infant. In other
      words, the applicant specifically claims an embodiment that has specific nutritional
      requirements for an Asian infant. number='13'Therefore, this suggests that common
      nutritional needs that may vary depending on the intended infant, can easily
      be understood and adjusted by one of ordinary skill in the art. \\n\\tThe applicant\u2019s
      comment about the double patenting rejection is noted but the rejection remains
      until it is no longer necessary or an appropriate terminal disclaimer is filed.
      \\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nApplicant's amendment necessitated the new ground(s) of
      rejection presented in this Office action.  Accordingly, THIS ACTION IS MADE
      FINAL.  See MPEP \xA7 706.07(a).  Applicant is reminded of the extension of
      time policy as set forth in 37 CFR 1.136(a).  \\nA shortened statutory period
      for reply to this final action is set to expire THREE MONTHS from the mailing
      date of this action.  In the event a first reply is filed within TWO MONTHS
      of the mailing date of this final action and the advisory action is not mailed
      until after the end of the THREE-MONTH shortened statutory period, then the
      shortened statutory period will expire on the date the advisory action is mailed,
      and any extension fee pursuant to 37 CFR 1.136(a) will be calculated from the
      mailing date of the advisory action.  In no event, however, will the statutory
      period for reply expire later than SIX MONTHS from the date of this final action.

      of forming the mold compound and then exposing the first edge for electroplating
      (claim 1). \\nRestriction for examination purposes as indicated is proper because
      all these inventions listed in this action are independent or distinct for the
      reasons given above and there would be a serious search and/or examination burden
      if restriction were not required because one or more of the following reasons
      apply: the inventions have acquired a separate status in the art in view of
      their different classification.\\n Applicant is advised that the reply to this
      requirement to be complete must include (i) an election of an invention to be
      examined even though the requirement may be traversed (37 CFR 1.143) and (ii)
      identification of the claims encompassing the elected invention. \\nThe election
      of an invention may be made with or without traverse. To reserve a right to
      petition, the election must be made with traverse. If the reply does not distinctly
      and specifically point out supposed errors in the restriction requirement, the
      election shall be treated as an election without traverse. Traversal must be
      presented at the time of election in order to be considered timely. Failure
      to timely traverse the requirement will result in the loss of right to petition
      under 37 CFR 1.144. If claims are added after the election, applicant must indicate
      which of these claims are readable upon the elected invention.\\nShould applicant
      traverse on the ground that the inventions are not patentably distinct, applicant
      should submit evidence or identify such evidence now of record showing the inventions
      to be obvious variants or clearly admit on the record that this is the case.
      In either instance, if the examiner finds one of the inventions unpatentable
      over the prior art, the evidence or admission may be used in a rejection under
      35 U.S.C. 103 or pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) of the other invention.\\n\\nConclusion\\nAny

      under 35 U.S.C. 112(b) or 35 U.S.C. 112 (pre-AIA ), second paragraph, as being
      indefinite for failing to particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject
      matter which the inventor or a joint inventor, or for pre-AIA  the applicant
      regards as the invention.\\nClaims 8 and 21 recite the limitation \u201Ca ramp

      to variations in switching frequency and ramp amplitude to maintain duty cycle
      at a constant value\u201D in lines 10-12 and 8-10 respectively.  It is unclear
      what is meant by this limitation.  \\n \\tClaims 9-14 and 22-26 depend directly

      system (as seen in Fig 2) including a winch line (24), the payload suspended
      from a first end of the line (as seen in Fig 3B), and the system is controllable

      during payload ascent (the system is configured to damp oscillations during

      and descent; note: the claim \\nEadie discloses connection to a single load
      or multiple loads, and that \u201Cany number\u201D of cables may be used ([0023]),
      but does specifically not disclose the payload suspended from a single line.\\nJacobs
      discloses a load winch system using a single line (as seen in Figs 1A-4).\\nIt
      would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the
      time the invention was filed to have modified Eadie to use a single line as
      taught by Jacobs for the predictable advantage of reducing the weight and complexity
      of the winch system by eliminating the need for multiple lines and associated
      equipment (e.g. winches, programming, etc.).\\nThe claims recites an unmanned

      UAV is required, Jacobs discloses load winch systems which may be used for manned
      or unmanned aircraft (e.g. col 5, lines 40-44).\\nIt would have been obvious
      to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was filed

      timewise extension of the \u201Cright to exclude\u201D granted by a patent and
      to prevent possible harassment by multiple assignees. A nonstatutory double
      patenting rejection is appropriate where the conflicting claims are not identical,
      but at least one examined application claim is not patentably distinct from
      the reference claim(s) because the examined application claim is either anticipated
      by, or would have been obvious over, the reference claim(s). See, e.g., In re
      Berg, 140 F.3d 1428, 46 USPQ2d 1226 (Fed. Cir. 1998); In re Goodman, 11 F.3d
      1046, 29 USPQ2d 2010 (Fed. Cir. 1993); In re Longi, 759 F.2d 887, 225 USPQ 645
      (Fed. Cir. 1985); In re Van Ornum, 686 F.2d 937, 214 USPQ 761 (CCPA 1982); In
      re Vogel, 422 F.2d 438, 164 USPQ 619 (CCPA 1970); In re Thorington, 418 F.2d
      528, 163 USPQ 644 (CCPA 1969).\\nA timely filed terminal disclaimer in compliance
      with 37 CFR 1.321(c) or 1.321(d) may be used to overcome an actual or provisional
      rejection based on nonstatutory double patenting provided the reference application
      or patent either is shown to be commonly owned with the examined application,
      or claims an invention made as a result of activities undertaken within the
      scope of a joint research agreement. See MPEP \xA7 717.02 for applications subject
      to examination \\nThe USPTO Internet website contains terminal disclaimer forms
      which may be used. Please visit www.uspto.gov/patent/patents-forms. The filing

      over claims 1-16 of U.S. Patent No. 9 422 139. Although the claims at issue
      are not identical, they are not patentably distinct from each other because
      the patented claims recite the substantially the same structure and control
      configuration for a UAV payload oscillation damping system as the pending claims,
      with the patented claims referring to specific components (e.g. IMU) for performing
      some of the operations.\\n\\nClaims 1-20 are rejected on the ground of nonstatutory
      double patenting as being unpatentable over claims 11-19 of U.S. Patent No.

      [R-l] Product-by-Process Claims \\nPRODUCT-BY-PROCESS CLAIMS ARE NOT LIMITED
      TO THE \\nMANIPULATIONS OF THE RECITED STEPS, ONLY THE STRUCTURE \\nIMPLIED
      BY THE STEPS \\n\\\"[E]ven though product-by-process claims are limited by and
      defined by the process, determination of patentability is based on the product
      itself. The patentability of a product does not depend on its method of production.
      If the product in the product-by-process claim is the same as or obvious from
      a product of the prior art, the claim is unpatentable even though the prior
      product was made by a different process.\\\" In re Thorpe, 777 F.2d 695,698,227
      USPQ 964, 966 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (citations omitted) (Claim was directed to a
      novolac color developer. The process of making the developer was allowed. The
      difference between the inventive process and the prior art was the addition
      of metal oxide and carboxylic acid as separate ingredients instead of adding
      the more expensive pre-reacted metal carboxylate. The product-by-process claim
      was  rejected because the end product, in both the prior art and the allowed
      process, ends up containing metal carboxylate. The fact that the metal carboxylate
      is not directly added, but is instead produced in-situ does not change the end
      product.) \\nRegarding Claim 1, Dorst discloses an (overhead) conductor (Fig
      1-2) comprising an assembly including one (40) or more conductive wires, wherein
      the assembly comprises an outer surface (not labeled; outer surface of 40) coated
      with an (electrochemical deposition) coating (41; Column 2, lines 1-46; \u201Csimultaneous
      deposition at an anode, by means of current\u201D; \u201Celectrophoretic means\u201D)
      such that the (electrochemical deposition) coating (41) contacts at least one
      of the one (40) or more conductive wires, the (electrochemical deposition) coating
      (41) comprising: a first metal oxide (\u201Czinc oxide\u201D, \u201Ctitanium
      oxide\u201D, \u201Czirconium oxide\u201D, \u201C\u201Dsilicon dioxide\u201D,
      \u201Ctitanium dioxide\u201D; Column 1, lines 36-55; Column 4, lines 17-54,
      Column 5, lines 14-24), wherein the first metal oxide is not aluminum oxide;
      wherein the (electrochemical deposition) coating (41) defines a single outer
      layer (see Fig 2) wherein the (electrochemical deposition) coating (41) having
      a thickness of about 5 microns (Column 6, lines 69-74).\\nDorst does not explicitly
      disclose wherein the (electrochemical deposition) coating having a thickness
      of about 12 microns to about 25 microns.\\nSawada\u2019609 teaches of a conductor
      (Fig 2, Example 4, Column 6, lines 30-68) comprising an assembly including one
      (10,11) or more conductive wires, wherein the assembly comprises an outer surface
      coated with an (electrochemical deposition) (2; \u201Canodic oxide film\u201D;
      Column 6, lines 30-68) coating (2,3) comprising: a first metal oxide (2; \u201Canodic
      oxide film\u201D); wherein the electrochemical deposition coating (2; \u201Canodic
      oxide film\u201D) defines a single outer layer (see Fig 2; note that this does
      not limit another layer  above this anodic oxide film layer) having a thickness
      of about 12 microns to about 25 microns (Column 6, lines 30-68; \u201C15 \xB5m\u201D).\\nIt
      would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the
      invention to have a conductor as disclosed by Dorst, wherein the (electrochemical
      deposition) coating defines a single outer layer having a thickness of about
      12 microns to about 25 microns as taught by Sawada\u2019609, in order to provide
      insulation (and good insulation strength), provide excellent adhesion and also
      provide good heat resistance and good flexibility (Sawada\u2019609, Column 3,
      lines 4-68) and furthermore since it has been held that where the general conditions
      of a claim are disclosed in the prior art, discovering the optimum or workable
      ranges involves only routine skill in the art.  In re Aller, 105 USPQ 233 (1955).
      \\nDorst in view of Sawada\u2019609 does not explicitly teach the cable \u201Cwherein
      the operating temperature of the overhead conductor is lower than the operating
      temperature of a bare conductor by at least 5\xB0C, when uncoated and the same
      current is applied\u201D (although all of the claimed structure is present by
      Dorst in view of Sawada\u2019609, and therefore the prior art is capable of
      performing the same functions)\u201D.  The Office realizes that all of the claimed
      effects or physical properties are not positively stated by the reference(s).
      \ However the reference(s) teaches all of the claimed ingredients, claimed amounts,
      and substantially similar process of making.  See MPEP \xA7 2112.01.  If it
      is the applicant\u2019s position that this would not be the case: (1) evidence
      would need to be provided to support the applicant\u2019s position; and (2)
      it would be the Office\u2019s position that the application contains inadequate
      disclosure that there is no  teaching as to how to obtain the claimed properties
      with only the claimed ingredients, claimed amounts, and substantially similar
      process of making.\\nClaim states in the preamble of the claim, \u201Coverhead\u201D,
      however the preamble does not have patentable weight and therefore the device
      lacks the limitation of overhead.\\nClaim states \u201Coverhead\u201D however
      it has been held that a recitation with respect to the manner in which a claimed
      apparatus is intended to be employed does not differentiate the claimed apparatus
      from a prior art apparatus satisfying the claimed structural limitations. Ex
      parte Masham, 2 USPQ2d 1647 (1987)\\nClaim states \u201Celectrochemical deposition\u201D
      but \u201Celectrochemical deposition\u201D does not represent product structure
      but only refers to the process by which the coating is formed.  Thus Claim is
      a product claim that recites a process step(s) of electrochemical deposition
      and is thus treated as a product-by-process claim.\\nClaim states \u201Cwhen
      uncoated and the same current is applied\u201D but \u201Cwhen uncoated and the
      same current is applied\u201D does not represent product structure but only
      refers to the process by which the wire is used.  Thus Claim is a product claim
      that recites a process step(s) of removing a coating and applying a current
      and is thus treated as a product-by-process claim.\\nRegarding Claim 2, Dorst
      in view of Sawada\u2019609 teaches the limitations of the preceding claim.\\n
      Dorst further discloses the (overhead) conductor (Fig 1-2), wherein the first
      metal oxide (\u201Czinc oxide\u201D, \u201Ctitanium oxide\u201D, \u201Czirconium

      claim, \u201Coverhead\u201D, however the preamble does not have patentable weight
      and therefore the device lacks the limitation of overhead.\\nClaim states \u201Coverhead\u201D

      a claimed apparatus is intended to be employed does not differentiate the claimed
      apparatus from a prior art apparatus satisfying the claimed structural limitations.

      Sawada\u2019609 teaches the limitations of the preceding claim.\\nDorst does
      not disclose the (overhead) conductor, wherein the (electrochemical deposition)
      coating further comprises a second metal oxide, wherein the second metal oxide
      is aluminum oxide.\\nSawada\u2019609 further teaches of a conductor (Fig 2,
      Example 4, Column 6, lines 30-68), wherein the (electrochemical deposition)
      coating (2,3) further comprises a  second metal oxide (2; \u201Coxide insulating
      layer 3 of Example 4 is also of aluminum oxide\u201D), wherein the second metal
      oxide is aluminum oxide.\\nIt would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill
      in the art at the time of the invention to have a conductor as taught by Dorst
      in view of Sawada\u2019609, wherein the (electrochemical deposition) coating
      further comprises a second metal oxide, wherein the second metal oxide is aluminum
      oxide as taught by Sawada\u2019609, in order to provide excellent heat resistance
      and insulability strength under higher temperatures (Sawada, Column 2, lines
      8-31, Column 3, lines 18-68, Column 7, lines 13-19).\\nClaim states in the preamble
      of the claim, \u201Coverhead\u201D, however the preamble does not have patentable
      weight and therefore the device lacks the limitation of overhead.\\nClaim states
      \u201Coverhead\u201D however it has been held that a recitation with respect
      to the manner in which a claimed apparatus is intended to be employed does not

      claim.\\nRegarding Claim 5, Dorst in view of Sawada\u2019609 teaches the limitations
      of the preceding claim.\\n Dorst further discloses the (overhead) conductor
      (Fig 1-2), wherein the one or more conductive wires (40) are formed of copper
      (Column 5, lines 5-12; \u201Ccopper\u201D) or copper alloy.\\nSawada\u2019609

      use as a matter of obvious design choice.  In re Leshin, 125 USPQ 416 (1960)\\nDorst
      in view of Sawada\u2019609 and Sawada\u2019851 does not explicitly teach the
      cable \u201Cwherein the operating temperature of the overhead conductor is lower
      than the operating temperature of a bare conductor by at least 5\xB0C, when
      uncoated and the same current is applied\u201D (although all of the claimed
      structure is present by Dorst in view of Sawada\u2019609 and Sawada\u2019851,
      and therefore the prior art is capable of performing the same functions)\u201D.
      \ The Office realizes that all of the claimed effects or physical properties
      are not positively stated by the reference(s).  However the reference(s) teaches
      all of the claimed ingredients, claimed amounts, and substantially similar process
      of making.  See MPEP \xA7 2112.01.  If it is the applicant\u2019s position that
      this would not be the case: (1) evidence would need to be provided to support
      the applicant\u2019s position; and (2) it would be the Office\u2019s position
      that the application contains inadequate disclosure that there is no teaching
      as to how to obtain the claimed properties with only the claimed ingredients,
      claimed amounts, and substantially similar process of making.\\nClaim states
      in the preamble of the claim, \u201Coverhead\u201D, however the preamble does
      not have patentable weight and therefore the device lacks the limitation of
      overhead.\\nClaim states \u201Coverhead\u201D however it has been held that
      a recitation with respect to the manner in which a claimed apparatus is intended
      to be employed does not number='17'differentiate the claimed apparatus from
      a prior art apparatus satisfying the claimed structural limitations. Ex parte
      Masham, 2 USPQ2d 1647 (1987)\\nClaim states \u201Celectrochemical deposition\u201D
      but \u201Celectrochemical deposition\u201D does not represent product structure
      but only refers to the process by which the coating is formed.  Thus Claim is
      a product claim that recites a process step(s) of electrochemical deposition
      and is thus treated as a product-by-process claim.\\nClaim states \u201Cwhen

      claim.\\nDorst does not disclose the (overhead) conductor, wherein the (electrochemical
      deposition) coating is non-white. \\nnumber='18'Jang teaches a cable (Abstract)
      wherein a coating is non-white (Column 2, lines 4-64, Table I-III).\\nIt would

      to have a conductor as taught by Dorst in view of Sawada\u2019609, wherein the
      coating is non-white, in order to show different functions of conductors, aesthetically
      appear more valuable, and resist high temperatures (Jang, Column 1, lines 5-54).
      \\nClaim 8 states \u201Celectrochemical deposition\u201D but \u201Celectrochemical
      deposition\u201D does not represent product structure but only refers to the
      process by which the coating is formed.  Thus Claim 8 is a product claim that

      may be expressed as a means or step for performing a specified function without
      the recital of structure, material, or acts in support thereof, and such claim
      shall be construed to cover the corresponding structure, material, or acts described
      in the specification and equivalents thereof.\\n\\nThe following is a quotation
      of pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 112, sixth paragraph:\\nAn element in a claim for a combination
      may be expressed as a means or step for performing a specified function without
      the recital of structure, material, or acts in support thereof, and such claim
      shall be construed to cover the corresponding structure, material, or acts described
      in the specification and equivalents thereof.\\n\\nUse of the word \u201Cmeans\u201D

      \xA7 112(f) (pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 112, sixth paragraph).  The presumption that
      \xA7 112(f) (pre-AIA  \xA7 112, sixth paragraph) is invoked is rebutted when
      the function is recited with sufficient structure, material, or acts within
      the claim itself to entirely perform the recited function. \\n\\nAbsence of
      the word \u201Cmeans\u201D (or \u201Cstep for\u201D) in a claim creates a rebuttable

      U.S.C. \xA7 112(f) (pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 112, sixth paragraph).  The presumption
      that \xA7 112(f) (pre-AIA  \xA7 112, sixth paragraph) is not invoked is rebutted
      when the claim element recites function but fails to recite sufficiently definite
      structure, material or acts to perform that function. \\n\\nClaim elements in

      - 35 USC \xA7 101\\n35 U.S.C. 101 reads as follows:\\nWhoever invents or discovers
      any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter,
      or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject
      to the conditions and requirements of this title.\\n\\n\\nClaims 1-2, 4-6, 15
      and 16 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 101 because the claimed invention is directed
      to a judicial exception (i.e., a law of nature, a natural phenomenon, or an
      abstract idea) without significantly more. Claim(s) 1-2, 4-6, 15 and 16 is/are
      directed to abstract idea (mathematical formula). The claim(s) does/do not include
      additional elements that are sufficient to amount to significantly more than
      the judicial exception because the program steps being recited to claim 1 are
      merely abstract instructions (program steps) which are being performed via a
      program within the ECU. The additional element(s) or combination of elements
      in the claim(s) other than the abstract idea per se amount(s) to no more than:
      mere instructions to implement the idea on a computer since as stated in the
      112 (b) rejection to claim 1 above, it is not clear if any step is being performed
      in the physical world. Viewed as a whole, these additional claim element(s)
      do not provide meaningful limitation(s) to transform the abstract idea into
      a patent eligible application of the abstract idea such that the claim(s) amounts
      to significantly more than the abstract idea itself. Therefore, the claim(s)
      are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 101 as being directed to non-statutory subject
      matter.\\n Examiner\u2019s suggestion to overcome the first part of the 112
      (b) and the 101 rejection: amending claim 1 to include a step such as \u201Coperating
      the wind turbine with variable rotational speed between the changed minimum
      rational speed and the predeterminable maximum rotational speed\u201D.\\n\\nFurther,
      per Preliminary Examination Instructions in view of the Supreme Court Decision
      in Alice Corporation Ply. Ltd. v. CLS Bank International, et al. of June 25,
      2014: \\nThe Court determined that Alice Corp.'s claims to methods were ineligible
      because \\\"the claims at issue amount to 'nothing significantly more' than
      an instruction to apply the abstract idea of intermediated settlement using
      some unspecified, generic computer.\\\" Alice Corp.'s claims to computer systems
      and computer-readable storage media were held ineligible for substantially the
      same reasons, e.g., that the generically-recited computers in the claims add
      nothing of substance to the underlying abstract idea.\\n\\nhttp://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2014-12-16/pdf/2014-29414.pdf\\n\\nClaim

      is a quotation of pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) which forms the basis for all obviousness
      rejections set forth in this Office action:\\n(a) A patent may not be obtained
      though the invention is not identically disclosed or described as set forth
      in section 102 of this title, if the differences between the subject matter
      sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as
      a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person
      having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.  Patentability
      shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made.\\n\\n\\nThis
      application currently names joint inventors. In considering patentability of
      the claims under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a), the examiner presumes that the subject
      matter of the various claims was commonly owned at the time any inventions covered
      therein number='14'were made absent any evidence to the contrary.  Applicant
      is advised of the obligation under 37 CFR 1.56 to point out the inventor and
      invention dates of each claim that was not commonly owned at the time a later
      invention was made in order for the examiner to consider the applicability of
      pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(c) and potential pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 102(e), (f) or (g)
      prior art under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a).\\n\\nClaim 14 (as best understood)
      are rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Bjerge
      in view of Bjerge in view of US Patent No. 4,651,017 to Longrigg (Longrigg).\\n\\nIn
      Reference to Claim 14\\nBjerge teaches (except for the bolded and italic limitations
      below):\\nThe wind turbine according to claim 8 (see rejection to claim 8 above),
      wherein the open-loop or closed-loop control device (20) has a delay element
      (see Bjerge Figs. 1-3 and paragraphs 10-19, 29-48, 54-78).\\nBjerge is silent
      as to having the control device having a delay element. However it is known
      in the art at the time of the invention was made that the control device which
      controls the oscillation of the wind turbine includes a low pass filter. For
      example, Longrigg teaches that the control device (42) which controls the oscillation
      of the wind turbine includes a low pass filter (60). Longrigg further teaches
      that having the low pass filter provide oscillation-free translation of the
      turbine speed (see at least Longrigg column 4 lines 38-51 and Fig.1). number='15'Therefore
      it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of
      the invention was made to modify the system of Bjerge to include the low pass
      filter as taught by Longrigg in order to provide oscillation-free translation
      of the turbine speed.\\n\\nClaim 17 (as best understood) are rejected under
      pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Bjerge in view of US 3,899,921
      to Hockley (Hockley).\\n\\nIn Reference to Claim 17\\nBjerge teaches (except
      for the bolded and italic limitations below):\\nThe wind turbine according to
      claim 8 (see rejection to claim 8 above), wherein the sensor (24) is a strain
      gauge (see Bjerge Figs. 1-3 and paragraphs 10-19, 29-48, 54-78).\\nBjerge teaches
      accelerometer (24) to determine oscillation of the wind turbine and Bjerge is
      silent as to the sensor (24) is being a strain gauge. However, it is known in
      the art at the time of the invention was made that the strain gauge or accelerometer
      can be used to measure the oscillation of the system. For example, Hockley teaches
      that the strain gauge or accelerometer can be used to measure the oscillation
      of the system (see at least Hockley column 2 lines 1-16 and Fig.1). Therefore
      it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of
      the invention was made that the \\nnumber='16'The substitution of one known
      element (the strain gauge as shown in Hockley) for another (accelerometer as
      shown in Bjerge) would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art
      at the time of the invention since the substitution of the strain gauge as shown
      in Hockley would have yielded predictable results, namely, measuring the oscillation
      of the wind turbine of Bjerge.\\n\\nResponse to Arguments\\nApplicant's arguments
      filed 1/5/2016 have been fully considered but they are not persuasive. \\nThe
      applicant argues regarding the 112 2nd paragraph to the limitations from newly
      amended claim 1 is now clear and further argues that \u201Cif a minimum rotational
      speed was being changed (i.e. the changing step), it is considered apparent
      that the speed would be either be increased or reduced\u201D. The examiner disagree
      since the step recited in claim 1 is \\\"changing the minimum rotational speed\\\"
      however the recitation \\\"where an increase in the minimum rotational speed
      takes place at a greater rate than a reduction in the minimum rotational speed\u201D
      is not clear as to if the \\\"increase\\\" and \\\"a reduction\\\" is intended
      result of the step of \\\"changing\\\" (therefore the recitation following the
      \\\"wherein\\\" can happen however does not necessary require it) or is the
      recitation further defining the step of \u201Cchanging\u201D in such a way that
      recitations following the \u201Cwherein\u201D is required part of the step of
      \u201Cchanging\u201D (see MPEP 2111.04). Therefore, claim 1 is still rejected
      under 112 2nd paragraph for indefinites and the interpretation of number='17'the
      claim for the purposes of treating the claim under prior art would still be
      the same from the previous office action, the recitation following \\\"wherein\\\"
      is intended result. \\nApplicant further argues that Bjerge does not teach the
      newly amended claim 1 since Bjerge does not teach \u201Can increase in the minimum
      rotational speed takes place at a greater rate than a reduction in the minimum
      rotational speed\u201D, the examiner agree that Bjerge does not explicitly teach
      \u201Can increase in the minimum rotational speed takes place at a greater rate
      than a reduction in the minimum rotational speed\u201D however the applicant's
      arguments are not commensurate with the scope of the claim since the recitations
      of \u201Can increase in the minimum rotational speed takes place at a greater
      rate than a reduction in the minimum rotational speed\u201D in claims 1 and
      8 are not positively recited as being an step or the configuration of the control
      device (see 112 (b) rejections to claims 1 and 8 above).\\n\\nConclusion\\nAny

      \       \"sections.section103RejectionText\":[\"Claims 1-10 and 12 are rejected
      under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable over Hendrix et al (US 2002/0192407)
      as evidenced by Trinh et al (US Patent No. 6,790,819).\\nHendrix et al teach
      a premoistened wipe comprising a: i) nonwoven substrate; and ii) lotion, the
      lotion comprising: a) a softness and feel improving agent; b)  surfactant; and
      c) an aqueous carrier (abstract).  Suitable surfactants within the lotion include
      mixtures of non-ionic surfactants comprising Silwet L-7210 and block copolymers
      of propylene oxide and ethylene oxide (paragraphs 0074-0075, 0080).  As evidenced
      by the instant specification and applicant\u2019s elected species, Silwet L-7210
      is a silicone polyether block copolymer that meets the limitations of the wt.%
      silicone, wt.% polyethylene oxide, and wt.% polypropylene oxide set forth in
      instant claims 1-3 as well as the weight ratios of polyethylene oxide to polypropylene
      oxide set forth in instant claims 6-7 (see pg. 23 of the instant specification,
      2nd full table).  As evidenced by Trinh et al, Silwet L-7210 has a molecular
      weight of 13,000 (column 44, lines 1-8), which falls within the molecular weight
      range set forth in instant claims 4-5.  The amount of non-ionic surfactant in
      the lotions is preferably present in an amount of 0.002% to about 0.4% by weight
      of the lotion (paragraph 0083).  \\nFurther, Hendrix et al teach its lotions
      can comprise optional ingredients in amounts of preferably 0.003% to about 1%
      by weight of the composition including polyethylene oxide, like Polyox WSF N-750
      (paragraphs 0101-103).  As evidenced by the instant specification, Polyox WSF
      N-750 has a molecular weight of 300,000 (see pp. 22-23) and thus, meets the
      limitations of the water soluble polymer set forth in instant claims 8-10. \\nYet,
      although Hendrix et al suggest Silwet L-7210 as a non-ionic surfactant in its
      lotions; they are not immediately envisaged.\\nHowever, it would have been obvious
      to an artisan of ordinary skill before the effective filing date of the claimed
      invention to incorporate a non-ionic surfactant, like  Silwet L-7210, within
      the lotions of Hendrix et al.  One would have been motivated to do so because
      Hendrix et al teach many alternative non-ionic surfactants are suitable within
      its lotions including Silwet L-7210.  When addressing the issue of obviousness,
      the Supreme Court noted that the analysis under 35 USC 103 \u201Cneed not seek
      out precise teachings directed to the specific subject matter of the challenged
      claim, for a court can take account of the inferences and creative steps that
      a person of ordinary skill in the art would employ.\u201D  KSR v. Teleflex,
      127 S.Ct. 1727, 1741 (2007).  The Court emphasized that \u201C[a] person of
      ordinary skill is\u2026 a person of ordinary creativity, not an automaton.\u201D
      \ Id. at 1742.  Because all the claimed elements were known in the prior art
      and one skilled in the art could have combined the elements as claimed by known
      methods with no change in their respective functions and the combination yielded
      nothing more than predictable results to one of ordinary skill in the art, the
      claimed invention is obvious. KSR International Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 82 USPQ2d
      1385, 1395 (S. Ct. 2007).\\nWith respect to the amount of Silwet L-7210 in the
      lotions of Hendrix et al; Hendrix et al teach an amount (0.002% to about 0.4%
      by weight) that overlaps with the amount of silicone polyether block copolymer
      of the composition recited in the instant claims.  According to MPEP 2144.05,
      \u201CIn the case where the claimed ranges \u2018overlap or lie inside ranges
      disclosed by the prior art\u2019 a prima facie case of obviousness exists.\u201D
      In re Wertheim, 541 F.2d 257, 191 USPQ 90 (CCPA 1976).  It also would have been
      obvious to an artisan of ordinary skill to manipulate and optimize the amount
      of Silwet L-7210.  Optimization of parameters is a routine practice that would
      be obvious to a  person of ordinary skill in the art to employ and reasonably
      expect success.  It should be noted that generally difference in concentrations
      do not support the patentability of subject matter encompassed by the prior
      art unless there is evidence indicating such a concentration is critical.  See
      In re Aller, 220 F.2d 454, 456, 105 USPQ 233, 235 (CCPA 1955) & MPEP 2144.05.\\nWith
      respect to the preamble of the instant claims, \u201CA composition dispensing
      hair removal device\u2026\u201D; it should be noted that such a limitation has
      not been given patentable weight because the recitation occurs in the preamble.
      \ A preamble is generally not accorded any patentable weight where it merely
      recites the purpose of a process or the intended use of a structure, and where
      the body of the claim does not depend on the preamble for completeness but,
      instead, the process steps or structural limitations are able to stand alone.
      \ See In re Hirao, 535 F.2d 67, 190 USPQ 15 (CCPA 1976) and Kropa v. Robie,
      187 F.2d 150, 152, 88 USPQ 478, 481 (CCPA 1951).  In this case, the limitations
      directed to \\\"hair removal\\\" will not be given patentable weight as it is
      directed to an intended use.  Further, since the lotions of Hendrix et al are
      incorporated on a nonwoven substrate to produce premoistened wipe products that
      can be packaged in a container (paragraph 0118); the examiner is interpreting
      the container of Hendrix et al to be the device of the instant claims.\\n With
      respect to the amount of the water soluble polymer set forth in instant claim
      8; Hendrix et al teach an amount (0.003% to about 1% by weight) of polyethylene
      oxide that overlaps with the amount recited in the instant claims (see the teachings
      above).  According to MPEP 2144.05, \u201CIn the case where the claimed ranges
      \u2018overlap or lie  inside ranges disclosed by the prior art\u2019 a prima
      facie case of obviousness exists.\u201D In re Wertheim, 541 F.2d 257, 191 USPQ
      90 (CCPA 1976).  It also would have been obvious to an artisan of ordinary skill
      to manipulate and optimize the amount of polyethylene oxide within the lotion.
      \ Optimization of parameters is a routine practice that would be obvious to
      a person of ordinary skill in the art to employ and reasonably expect success.
      \ See In re Aller & MPEP 2144.05 above.\\nWith respect to the limitations of
      instant claim 12; Hendrix et al teach other non-ionic surfactants in its lotions
      can include copolymers of propylene oxide and ethylene oxide in addition to
      Silwet L-7210.  Hendrix et al teach an amount (0.002% to about 0.4% by weight)
      that overlaps with the amount of copolymer recited in the instant claims.  See
      In re Wertheim, In re Aller & MPEP 2144.05 above.  Further, it would have been
      obvious to add more than one non-ionic surfactant to the lotions of Hendrix
      et al because it is obvious to add more than one ingredient for the same intended
      purpose.  It is prima facie obvious to combine two compositions each of which
      is taught by the prior art to be useful for the same purpose, in order to form
      a third composition to be used for the very same purpose.... [T]he idea of combining
      them flows logically from their having been individually taught in the prior
      art.\u201D In re Kerkhoven, 626 F.2d 846, 850, 205 USPQ 1069, 1072 (CCPA 1980)
      (see MPEP 2144.06).\\n Claims 1-13 and 17 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as
      being unpatentable over Alwattari et al (US 2006/0257350) in view of Hendrix
      et al (US 2002/0192407) as evidenced by Trinh et al (US Patent No. 6,790,819).\\n
      number='10'Alwattari et al teach a shaving composition in the form of a post-foaming
      gel that includes a combination of three types of lubricants (abstract).  One
      of the lubricants is a water soluble polymer generally having a molecular weight
      between about 300,000 and 15,000,000 daltons, preferably more than about one
      million daltons (paragraph 0012).  A preferred lubricious water soluble polymer
      comprises polyethylene oxide (paragraph 0012) as set forth in instant claim
      9 in amounts of preferably about 0.01% to about 1% by weight (paragraph 0012).
      \ The composition may include a thickening agent in amounts of preferably about
      0.1% to 2 wt.% to improve consistency and stability, as well as to adjust its
      viscosity (paragraph 0020) as set forth in instant claim 13.  The post-foaming
      agent of the composition may be any volatile hydrocarbon or halohydrocarbon,
      like isobutane, in amounts of about 2 wt.% to about 5 wt.% (paragraphs 0011,
      claim 6).  Water is also exemplified in the compositions in amounts of about
      75-78 wt.% (see examples 1-5, paragraph 0023).  These amounts fall within the
      range of water and volatile post foaming agent recited in instant claim 17.\\nHowever,
      Alwattari et al do not teach compositions comprising the instant silicone polyether
      block copolymer.  Alwattari et al only envisage compositions with a water dispersible
      surface active agent that can be selected from mixtures of non-ionic surfactants
      (see paragraphs 0009-0010).\\nThe disclosure of Hendrix et al is discussed above
      and is incorporated herein.\\nTherefore, it would have been obvious to an artisan
      of ordinary skill before the effective filing date of the claimed invention
      to incorporate Hendrix\u2019s non-ionic surfactant, Silwet L-7210, into the
      post-foaming gels of Alwattari et al.  One would have number='11'been motivated
      to do so since the compositions of Alwattari et al envisage the incorporation
      of non-ionic surfactants and Hendrix et al teach Silwet L-7210 is a suitable
      non-ionic surfactant in cosmetic compositions applied to the skin.  A skilled
      artisan would have a reasonable expectation of success that Hendrix\u2019s Silwet
      L-7210 would lower the surface tension of Alwattari\u2019s compositions without
      skin irritation.  The court has reasoned a reasonable expectation of success
      in the art by stating that reading a list and selecting a known compound to
      meet known requirements is no more ingenious than selecting the last piece to
      put in the last opening in a jig-saw puzzle.  Sinclair & Carroll Co., 325 U.S.
      at 335, 65 USPQ at 301. Since all elements of the instant claims are taught
      in the prior art, combining the components for their intended use would have
      been obvious.    \\nAs noted above, Silwet L-7210 is a silicone polyether block
      copolymer that meets the limitations of the wt.% silicone, wt.% polyethylene
      oxide, and wt.% polypropylene oxide set forth in instant claims 1-3 as well
      as the weight ratios of polyethylene oxide to polypropylene oxide set forth
      in instant claims 6-7 (see pg. 23 of the instant specification, 2nd full table).
      \ As evidenced by Trinh et al, Silwet L-7210 has a molecular weight of 13,000
      (column 44, lines 1-8), which falls within the molecular weight range set forth
      in instant claims 4-5.\\nWith respect to the amount of Silwet L-7210; Hendrix
      et al teach an amount (0.002% to about 0.4% by weight) that overlaps with the
      amount of silicone polyether block copolymer of the composition recited in the
      instant claims.  According to MPEP 2144.05, \u201CIn the case where the claimed
      ranges \u2018overlap or lie inside ranges disclosed number='12'by the prior
      art\u2019 a prima facie case of obviousness exists.\u201D In re Wertheim, 541
      F.2d 257, 191 USPQ 90 (CCPA 1976).  It also would have been obvious to an artisan
      of ordinary skill to manipulate and optimize the amount of Silwet L-7210.  Optimization
      of parameters is a routine practice that would be obvious to a person of ordinary
      skill in the art to employ and reasonably expect success.  It should be noted
      that generally difference in concentrations do not support the patentability
      of subject matter encompassed by the prior art unless there is evidence indicating
      such a concentration is critical.  See In re Aller, 220 F.2d 454, 456, 105 USPQ
      233, 235 (CCPA 1955) & MPEP 2144.05.\\nWith respect to the preamble of the instant
      claims set forth in instant claims 1-16, \u201CA composition dispensing hair
      removal device\u2026\u201D; it should be noted that the compositions of Alwattari
      et al are used for hair removal (shaving) and can be packaged in any suitable
      dispenser normally used for dispensing shaving composition (i.e., collapsible
      tubes, pump or squeeze containers, and aerosol-type dispensers) (paragraph 0021).\\n
      With respect to the amount as well as the molecular weight of the water soluble
      polymer set forth in instant claims 8 and 10-11; Alwattari et al teach an amount
      (about 0.01% to about 1% by weight) and molecular weight of polyethylene oxide
      that overlaps with that recited in the instant claims (see the teachings above).
      \ According to MPEP 2144.05, \u201CIn the case where the claimed ranges \u2018overlap
      or lie inside ranges disclosed by the prior art\u2019 a prima facie case of
      obviousness exists.\u201D In re Wertheim, 541 F.2d 257, 191 USPQ 90 (CCPA 1976).
      \ It also would have been obvious to an artisan of number='13'ordinary skill
      to manipulate and optimize the amount and molecular weight of polyethylene oxide
      within the post-foaming gels.  Optimization of parameters is a routine practice
      that would be obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art to employ and
      reasonably expect success.  See In re Aller & MPEP 2144.05 above.\\nWith respect
      to the limitations of instant claim 12; Hendrix et al teach other non-ionic
      surfactants in its lotions can include copolymers of propylene oxide and ethylene
      oxide in addition to Silwet L-7210.  Hendrix et al teach also an amount (0.002%
      to about 0.4% by weight) that overlaps with the amount of copolymer recited
      in the instant claims.  See In re Wertheim, In re Aller & MPEP 2144.05 above.
      \ Therefore, it would have been obvious to add more than one non-ionic surfactant
      (mixtures of Silwet L-7210 and copolymers of propylene oxide and ethylene oxide)
      to the shaving compositions of Alwattari et al because it is obvious to add
      more than one ingredient for the same intended purpose.  It is prima facie obvious
      to combine two compositions each of which is taught by the prior art to be useful
      for the same purpose, in order to form a third composition to be used for the
      very same purpose.... [T]he idea of combining them flows logically from their

      F.2d 846, 850, 205 USPQ 1069, 1072 (CCPA 1980) (see MPEP 2144.06).\\n Claims
      1-17 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable over Alwattari et
      al (US 2006/0257350) in view of Hendrix et al (US 2002/0192407) as number='14'evidenced
      by Trinh et al (US Patent No. 6,790,819) and in further view of Royle et al
      (US 2011/0219621).\\nThe disclosures of Alwattari et al and Hendrix et al are
      discussed above and are incorporated herein.\\nThe teachings of Alwattari et
      al and Hendrix differ from instant claims 14-16 and optionally claims 1-13 and
      17, in that the references do not explicitly teach the structural features of
      the device, as required by instant claims 14-16.\\nRoyle et al teach a hair
      removal device, such as a razor for dispensing a fluid during use (abstract).
      \ The hair removal device includes a fluid dispensing member which comprises
      an elongated elastomeric contact member for dispensing the fluid onto the skin
      in a wide and flat layer of fluid (abstract).  The device includes a handle
      connected to a hair removal head, where the handle comprises a cavity for housing
      a fluid disposed within the handle, and an actuator adapted to displace the
      fluid from the cavity through a supply channel to an opening formed in the handle;
      and a fluid dispensing member comprising an elongated elastomeric contact region
      forming at least one dispensing orifice (paragraphs 0004, 0016).  As such, the
      device has all the structural features of the instant claims set forth in instant
      claims 14-15.  The fluid dispensing member can also comprise a one-way value
      (i.e., flap valve), which can be formed from the elongated elastomeric contact
      region (paragraph 0015) as set forth in instant claim 16.\\nTherefore, it would
      have been obvious to an artisan of ordinary skill before the effective filing
      date of the claimed invention to include the shaving compositions of number='15'Alwattari
      et al into the hair removal devices of Royle et al.  One would have been motivated
      to do so since the compositions of Alwattari et al are directed to shaving and
      Royle et al teach its devices are used for hair removal and are capable of depositing
      product in varying widths to precede the razor cartridge during a shaving stroke
      (see paragraph 0003 of Royle et al).  Thus, a skilled artisan would have a reasonable
      expectation of success to incorporate Alwattari's composition into the devices
      of Royle et al because such devices enable the user to efficiently remove hair
      and eliminate the need for two hand operation.  Because all the claimed elements
      were known in the prior art and one skilled in the art could have combined the
      elements as claimed by known methods with no change in their respective functions
      and the combination yielded nothing more than predictable results to one of
      ordinary skill in the art, the claimed invention is obvious. KSR International

      - 35 USC \xA7 103\\nThe following is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 103 which forms
      the basis for all obviousness rejections set forth in this Office action:\\nA
      patent for a claimed invention may not be obtained, notwithstanding that the
      claimed invention is not identically disclosed as set forth in section 102,
      if the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art are such
      that the claimed invention as a whole would have  been obvious before the effective
      filing date of the claimed invention to a person having ordinary skill in the
      art to which the claimed invention pertains. Patentability shall not be negated
      by the manner in which the invention was made.\\n\\nThe factual inquiries set
      forth in Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 148 USPQ 459 (1966), that are
      applied for establishing a background for determining obviousness under 35 U.S.C.
      103 are summarized as follows:\\n1. Determining the scope and contents of the
      prior art.\\n2. Ascertaining the differences between the prior art and the claims
      at issue.\\n3. Resolving the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art.\\n4.
      Considering objective evidence present in the application indicating obviousness
      or nonobviousness.\\nThis application currently names joint inventors. In considering
      patentability of the claims the examiner presumes that the subject matter of
      the various claims was commonly owned as of the effective filing date of the
      claimed invention(s) absent any evidence to the contrary.  Applicant is advised
      of the obligation under 37 CFR 1.56 to point out the inventor and effective
      filing dates of each claim that was not commonly owned as of the effective filing
      date of the later invention in order for the examiner to consider the applicability
      of 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(C) for any potential 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2) prior art against
      the later invention.\\nClaims 1-10 and 12 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as
      being unpatentable over Hendrix et al (US 2002/0192407) as evidenced by Trinh
      et al (US Patent No. 6,790,819).\\nHendrix et al teach a premoistened wipe comprising
      a: i) nonwoven substrate; and ii) lotion, the lotion comprising: a) a softness
      and feel improving agent; b)  surfactant; and c) an aqueous carrier (abstract).
      \ Suitable surfactants within the lotion include mixtures of non-ionic surfactants
      comprising Silwet L-7210 and block copolymers of propylene oxide and ethylene
      oxide (paragraphs 0074-0075, 0080).  As evidenced by the instant specification
      and applicant\u2019s elected species, Silwet L-7210 is a silicone polyether
      block copolymer that meets the limitations of the wt.% silicone, wt.% polyethylene
      oxide, and wt.% polypropylene oxide set forth in instant claims 1-3 as well
      as the weight ratios of polyethylene oxide to polypropylene oxide set forth
      in instant claims 6-7 (see pg. 23 of the instant specification, 2nd full table).
      \ As evidenced by Trinh et al, Silwet L-7210 has a molecular weight of 13,000
      (column 44, lines 1-8), which falls within the molecular weight range set forth
      in instant claims 4-5.  The amount of non-ionic surfactant in the lotions is
      preferably present in an amount of 0.002% to about 0.4% by weight of the lotion
      (paragraph 0083).  \\nFurther, Hendrix et al teach its lotions can comprise
      optional ingredients in amounts of preferably 0.003% to about 1% by weight of
      the composition including polyethylene oxide, like Polyox WSF N-750 (paragraphs
      0101-103).  As evidenced by the instant specification, Polyox WSF N-750 has
      a molecular weight of 300,000 (see pp. 22-23) and thus, meets the limitations
      of the water soluble polymer set forth in instant claims 8-10. \\nYet, although
      Hendrix et al suggest Silwet L-7210 as a non-ionic surfactant in its lotions;
      they are not immediately envisaged.\\nHowever, it would have been obvious to
      an artisan of ordinary skill before the effective filing date of the claimed
      invention to incorporate a non-ionic surfactant, like  Silwet L-7210, within
      the lotions of Hendrix et al.  One would have been motivated to do so because
      Hendrix et al teach many alternative non-ionic surfactants are suitable within
      its lotions including Silwet L-7210.  When addressing the issue of obviousness,
      the Supreme Court noted that the analysis under 35 USC 103 \u201Cneed not seek
      out precise teachings directed to the specific subject matter of the challenged
      claim, for a court can take account of the inferences and creative steps that
      a person of ordinary skill in the art would employ.\u201D  KSR v. Teleflex,
      127 S.Ct. 1727, 1741 (2007).  The Court emphasized that \u201C[a] person of
      ordinary skill is\u2026 a person of ordinary creativity, not an automaton.\u201D
      \ Id. at 1742.  Because all the claimed elements were known in the prior art
      and one skilled in the art could have combined the elements as claimed by known
      methods with no change in their respective functions and the combination yielded
      nothing more than predictable results to one of ordinary skill in the art, the
      claimed invention is obvious. KSR International Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 82 USPQ2d
      1385, 1395 (S. Ct. 2007).\\nWith respect to the amount of Silwet L-7210 in the
      lotions of Hendrix et al; Hendrix et al teach an amount (0.002% to about 0.4%
      by weight) that overlaps with the amount of silicone polyether block copolymer
      of the composition recited in the instant claims.  According to MPEP 2144.05,
      \u201CIn the case where the claimed ranges \u2018overlap or lie inside ranges
      disclosed by the prior art\u2019 a prima facie case of obviousness exists.\u201D
      In re Wertheim, 541 F.2d 257, 191 USPQ 90 (CCPA 1976).  It also would have been
      obvious to an artisan of ordinary skill to manipulate and optimize the amount
      of Silwet L-7210.  Optimization of parameters is a routine practice that would
      be obvious to a  person of ordinary skill in the art to employ and reasonably
      expect success.  It should be noted that generally difference in concentrations
      do not support the patentability of subject matter encompassed by the prior
      art unless there is evidence indicating such a concentration is critical.  See
      In re Aller, 220 F.2d 454, 456, 105 USPQ 233, 235 (CCPA 1955) & MPEP 2144.05.\\nWith
      respect to the preamble of the instant claims, \u201CA composition dispensing
      hair removal device\u2026\u201D; it should be noted that such a limitation has
      not been given patentable weight because the recitation occurs in the preamble.
      \ A preamble is generally not accorded any patentable weight where it merely
      recites the purpose of a process or the intended use of a structure, and where
      the body of the claim does not depend on the preamble for completeness but,
      instead, the process steps or structural limitations are able to stand alone.
      \ See In re Hirao, 535 F.2d 67, 190 USPQ 15 (CCPA 1976) and Kropa v. Robie,
      187 F.2d 150, 152, 88 USPQ 478, 481 (CCPA 1951).  In this case, the limitations
      directed to \\\"hair removal\\\" will not be given patentable weight as it is
      directed to an intended use.  Further, since the lotions of Hendrix et al are
      incorporated on a nonwoven substrate to produce premoistened wipe products that
      can be packaged in a container (paragraph 0118); the examiner is interpreting
      the container of Hendrix et al to be the device of the instant claims.\\nWith
      respect to the amount of the water soluble polymer set forth in instant claim
      8; Hendrix et al teach an amount (0.003% to about 1% by weight) of polyethylene
      oxide that overlaps with the amount recited in the instant claims (see the teachings
      above).  According to MPEP 2144.05, \u201CIn the case where the claimed ranges
      \u2018overlap or lie  inside ranges disclosed by the prior art\u2019 a prima
      facie case of obviousness exists.\u201D In re Wertheim, 541 F.2d 257, 191 USPQ
      90 (CCPA 1976).  It also would have been obvious to an artisan of ordinary skill
      to manipulate and optimize the amount of polyethylene oxide within the lotion.
      \ Optimization of parameters is a routine practice that would be obvious to
      a person of ordinary skill in the art to employ and reasonably expect success.
      \ See In re Aller & MPEP 2144.05 above.\\nWith respect to the limitations of
      instant claim 12; Hendrix et al teach other non-ionic surfactants in its lotions
      can include copolymers of propylene oxide and ethylene oxide in addition to
      Silwet L-7210.  Hendrix et al teach an amount (0.002% to about 0.4% by weight)
      that overlaps with the amount of copolymer recited in the instant claims.  See
      In re Wertheim, In re Aller & MPEP 2144.05 above.  Further, it would have been
      obvious to add more than one non-ionic surfactant to the lotions of Hendrix
      et al because it is obvious to add more than one ingredient for the same intended
      purpose.  It is prima facie obvious to combine two compositions each of which
      is taught by the prior art to be useful for the same purpose, in order to form
      a third composition to be used for the very same purpose.... [T]he idea of combining
      them flows logically from their having been individually taught in the prior
      art.\u201D In re Kerkhoven, 626 F.2d 846, 850, 205 USPQ 1069, 1072 (CCPA 1980)
      (see MPEP 2144.06).\\n\\n\\nClaims 1-13 and 17 are rejected under 35 U.S.C.
      103 as being unpatentable over Alwattari et al (US 2006/0257350) in view of
      Hendrix et al (US 2002/0192407) as evidenced by Trinh et al (US Patent No. 6,790,819).\\nnumber='10'Alwattari
      et al teach a shaving composition in the form of a post-foaming gel that includes
      a combination of three types of lubricants (abstract).  One of the lubricants
      is a water soluble polymer generally having a molecular weight between about
      300,000 and 15,000,000 daltons, preferably more than about one million daltons
      (paragraph 0012).  A preferred lubricious water soluble polymer comprises polyethylene
      oxide (paragraph 0012) as set forth in instant claim 9 in amounts of preferably
      about 0.01% to about 1% by weight (paragraph 0012).  The composition may include
      a thickening agent in amounts of preferably about 0.1% to 2 wt.% to improve
      consistency and stability, as well as to adjust its viscosity (paragraph 0020)
      as set forth in instant claim 13.  The post-foaming agent of the composition
      may be any volatile hydrocarbon or halohydrocarbon, like isobutane, in amounts
      of about 2 wt.% to about 5 wt.% (paragraphs 0011, claim 6).  Water is also exemplified
      in the compositions in amounts of about 75-78 wt.% (see examples 1-5, paragraph
      0023).  These amounts fall within the range of water and volatile post foaming
      agent recited in instant claim 17.\\nHowever, Alwattari et al do not teach compositions
      comprising the instant silicone polyether block copolymer.  Alwattari et al
      only envisage compositions with a water dispersible surface active agent that
      can be selected from mixtures of non-ionic surfactants (see paragraphs 0009-0010).\\nThe
      disclosure of Hendrix et al is discussed above and is incorporated herein.\\nTherefore,
      it would have been obvious to an artisan of ordinary skill before the effective
      filing date of the claimed invention to incorporate Hendrix\u2019s non-ionic
      surfactant, Silwet L-7210, into the post-foaming gels of Alwattari et al.  One
      would have number='11'been motivated to do so since the compositions of Alwattari
      et al envisage the incorporation of non-ionic surfactants and Hendrix et al
      teach Silwet L-7210 is a suitable non-ionic surfactant in cosmetic compositions
      applied to the skin.  A skilled artisan would have a reasonable expectation
      of success that Hendrix\u2019s Silwet L-7210 would lower the surface tension
      of Alwattari\u2019s compositions without skin irritation.  The court has reasoned
      a reasonable expectation of success in the art by stating that reading a list
      and selecting a known compound to meet known requirements is no more ingenious
      than selecting the last piece to put in the last opening in a jig-saw puzzle.
      \ Sinclair & Carroll Co., 325 U.S. at 335, 65 USPQ at 301. Since all elements
      of the instant claims are taught in the prior art, combining the components
      for their intended use would have been obvious.    \\nAs noted above, Silwet
      L-7210 is a silicone polyether block copolymer that meets the limitations of
      the wt.% silicone, wt.% polyethylene oxide, and wt.% polypropylene oxide set
      forth in instant claims 1-3 as well as the weight ratios of polyethylene oxide
      to polypropylene oxide set forth in instant claims 6-7 (see pg. 23 of the instant
      specification, 2nd full table).  As evidenced by Trinh et al, Silwet L-7210
      has a molecular weight of 13,000 (column 44, lines 1-8), which falls within
      the molecular weight range set forth in instant claims 4-5.\\nWith respect to
      the amount of Silwet L-7210; Hendrix et al teach an amount (0.002% to about
      0.4% by weight) that overlaps with the amount of silicone polyether block copolymer
      of the composition recited in the instant claims.  According to MPEP 2144.05,

      for dispensing shaving composition (i.e., collapsible tubes, pump or squeeze
      containers, and aerosol-type dispensers) (paragraph 0021).\\nWith respect to
      the amount as well as the molecular weight of the water soluble polymer set
      forth in instant claims 8 and 10-11; Alwattari et al teach an amount (about
      0.01% to about 1% by weight) and molecular weight of polyethylene oxide that
      overlaps with that recited in the instant claims (see the teachings above).

      \ It also would have been obvious to an artisan of number='13'ordinary skill
      to manipulate and optimize the amount and molecular weight of polyethylene oxide
      within the post-foaming gels.  Optimization of parameters is a routine practice
      that would be obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art to employ and
      reasonably expect success.  See In re Aller & MPEP 2144.05 above.\\nWith respect
      to the limitations of instant claim 12; Hendrix et al teach other non-ionic
      surfactants in its lotions can include copolymers of propylene oxide and ethylene
      oxide in addition to Silwet L-7210.  Hendrix et al teach also an amount (0.002%
      to about 0.4% by weight) that overlaps with the amount of copolymer recited
      in the instant claims.  See In re Wertheim, In re Aller & MPEP 2144.05 above.

      (US 2011/0219621).\\nThe disclosures of Alwattari et al and Hendrix et al are
      discussed above and are incorporated herein.\\nThe teachings of Alwattari et
      al and Hendrix differ from instant claims 14-16 and optionally claims 1-13 and
      17, in that the references do not explicitly teach the structural features of
      the device, as required by instant claims 14-16.\\nRoyle et al teach a hair
      removal device, such as a razor for dispensing a fluid during use (abstract).
      \ The hair removal device includes a fluid dispensing member which comprises
      an elongated elastomeric contact member for dispensing the fluid onto the skin
      in a wide and flat layer of fluid (abstract).  The device includes a handle
      connected to a hair removal head, where the handle comprises a cavity for housing
      a fluid disposed within the handle, and an actuator adapted to displace the
      fluid from the cavity through a supply channel to an opening formed in the handle;
      and a fluid dispensing member comprising an elongated elastomeric contact region
      forming at least one dispensing orifice (paragraphs 0004, 0016).  As such, the
      device has all the structural features of the instant claims set forth in instant
      claims 14-15.  The fluid dispensing member can also comprise a one-way value
      (i.e., flap valve), which can be formed from the elongated elastomeric contact
      region (paragraph 0015) as set forth in instant claim 16.\\nTherefore, it would
      have been obvious to an artisan of ordinary skill before the effective filing
      date of the claimed invention to include the shaving compositions of number='15'Alwattari
      et al into the hair removal devices of Royle et al.  One would have been motivated
      to do so since the compositions of Alwattari et al are directed to shaving and
      Royle et al teach its devices are used for hair removal and are capable of depositing
      product in varying widths to precede the razor cartridge during a shaving stroke
      (see paragraph 0003 of Royle et al).  Thus, a skilled artisan would have a reasonable
      expectation of success to incorporate Alwattari's composition into the devices
      of Royle et al because such devices enable the user to efficiently remove hair
      and eliminate the need for two hand operation.  Because all the claimed elements
      were known in the prior art and one skilled in the art could have combined the
      elements as claimed by known methods with no change in their respective functions
      and the combination yielded nothing more than predictable results to one of
      ordinary skill in the art, the claimed invention is obvious. KSR International
      Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 82 USPQ2d 1385, 1395 (S. Ct. 2007).\\n\\nDouble Patenting\\nThe
      nonstatutory double patenting rejection is based on a judicially created doctrine
      grounded in public policy (a policy reflected in the statute) so as to prevent
      the unjustified or improper timewise extension of the \u201Cright to exclude\u201D
      granted by a patent and to prevent possible harassment by multiple assignees.
      A nonstatutory double patenting rejection is appropriate where the conflicting
      claims are not identical, but at least one examined application claim is not
      patentably distinct from the reference claim(s) because the examined application
      claim is either anticipated by, or would have been obvious over, the reference
      claim(s). See, e.g., In re Berg, 140 F.3d 1428, 46 USPQ2d 1226 (Fed. Cir. 1998);
      In re Goodman, 11 F.3d 1046, 29 USPQ2d 2010 (Fed. Cir. 1993); In re Longi, 759
      F.2d 887, 225 USPQ 645 (Fed. Cir. 1985); In re Van Ornum, 686 F.2d 937, 214
      USPQ 761 (CCPA 1982); In re Vogel, 422 F.2d 438, 164 USPQ 619 (CCPA 1970); In
      re Thorington, 418 F.2d 528, 163 USPQ 644 (CCPA 1969).\\nA timely filed terminal
      disclaimer in compliance with 37 CFR 1.321(c) or 1.321(d) may be used to overcome
      an actual or provisional rejection based on nonstatutory number='16'double patenting
      provided the reference application or patent either is shown to be commonly
      owned with the examined application, or claims an invention made as a result
      of activities undertaken within the scope of a joint research agreement. See
      MPEP \xA7 717.02 for applications subject to examination under the first inventor
      to file provisions of the AIA  as explained in MPEP \xA7 2159.  See MPEP \xA7\xA7
      706.02(l)(1) - 706.02(l)(3) for applications not subject to examination under
      the first inventor to file provisions of the AIA . A terminal disclaimer must
      be signed in compliance with 37 CFR 1.321(b). \\nThe USPTO Internet website
      contains terminal disclaimer forms which may be used. Please visit www.uspto.gov/patent/patents-forms.
      The filing date of the application in which the form is filed determines what
      form (e.g., PTO/SB/25, PTO/SB/26, PTO/AIA /25, or PTO/AIA /26) should be used.
      A web-based eTerminal Disclaimer may be filled out completely online using web-screens.
      An eTerminal Disclaimer that meets all requirements is auto-processed and approved
      immediately upon submission. For more information about eTerminal Disclaimers,

      1-11 are provisionally rejected on the ground of nonstatutory double patenting
      as being unpatentable over claims 1-7 and 9-10 of copending Application No.
      15/193205.  Although the claims at issue are not identical, they are not patentably
      distinct from each other.\\nThe copending claims are directed to a lubricating
      member for use on a hair removal device that comprises about 0.1% to about 70
      % by weight of the silicone polyether block copolymer set forth in instant claims
      1-7 and a water soluble polymer, polyethylene oxide in an amount of about 1%
      to about 99% by weight set forth in instant claims 8-9.  The polyethylene oxide
      can have an average molecular weight of at least about 300,000 or about 1 million
      to about 5 million set forth in instant claims 10-11.\\nAs such, the scope of
      the copending claims anticipates the scope of the instant claims.\\nnumber='17'This
      is a provisional nonstatutory double patenting rejection because the patentably
      indistinct claims have not in fact been patented.\\n\\nClaims 1-7 and 10-11
      are provisionally rejected on the ground of nonstatutory double patenting as
      being unpatentable over claims 1, 4-5, and 15 of copending Application No. 15/193177.
      \ Although the claims at issue are not identical, they are not patentably distinct
      from each other.\\nThe copending claims are directed to a lubricating member
      for a razor cartridge comprising a lipophilic structurant and 0.1% to about
      60% by weight of the silicone polyether block copolymer set forth in instant
      claims 1-7.  The claims are also directed to a hair removal cartridge comprising
      the lubricating member.\\nAs such, the scope of the copending claims anticipates
      the scope of the instant claims.\\nThis is a provisional nonstatutory double
      patenting rejection because the patentably indistinct claims have not in fact
      been patented.\\n\\nConclusion\\nClaims 1-17 are rejected.  No claims are allowed.\\nAny

      are considered by the examiner to present overall appearances that are basically
      the same. Fig. 1 displays black outlines on a white background. Fig. 2 is the
      inverse of fig. 1. These differences between the appearances of the embodiments
      are considered minor and patentably indistinct, or are shown to be obvious in

      Objection\\nThe broken line statement does not adequately describe the purpose
      of the broken lines within the drawing disclosure. For consistency and clarity
      of the claim, the broken line statement must be amended to the following: \\n--The
      dash-dot broken lines illustrate the display screen that form no part of the
      claimed design. The outermost broken lines depict environmental structure of
      a vehicle and form no part of the claimed design. The dash-dash broken lines

      be filed as provided by 37 CFR 1.312. To ensure consideration of such an amendment,
      it MUST be submitted no later than the payment of the issue fee.\\nAuthorization
      for this examiner\u2019s amendment was given in an interview with Applicant\u2019s
      representative Vladislav Teplitskiy on 10/26/2018.\\nPreviously withdrawn claims
      15-25 have been cancelled.\\n\\n Allowable Subject Matter\\nClaims 1, 6-10 and
      12-14 are allowed.\\nThe following is an examiner\u2019s statement of reasons
      for allowance: the most pertinent prior art in record (US 2012/0253131 A1) by
      Malkowski discloses an articulating surgical access system for laparoscopic
      surgery which has most of the structural elements similar to the structural
      limitations as claimed in claim-1 however Malkowski. does not disclose or suggest
      a first plurality of control links having their one end connected to an intermediate
      member and the opposite end extends away through the base member and pushing
      on one control link while pulling on a corresponding control links of the first
      plurality of control links causes the base member, first plurality of coupled
      guides, intermediate member, second plurality of coupled guides and the end
      member to assume a continuous curved shape.\\nMalkowski also does not disclose
      a second plurality of control links causes the end member to maintain an orientation
      same as the base member and a third plurality of flexible control link having
      a first end connected to the tool holder and the second end extending away from
      the base member and pulling or pushing on one of the control links of third
      plurality control links causes the tool holder to be selectively moved into
      any of a plurality of orientations such that the third plurality of coupled
      guides between the end member and the tool holder defines a continuous curve
      from the end member to the tool holder. Other prior arts in record also do not
      teach or suggest these deficiencies.\\n Any comments considered necessary by
      applicant must be submitted no later than the payment of the issue fee and,
      to avoid processing delays, should preferably accompany the issue fee.  Such

      reasons for allowance: The prior art made of record fails to disclose an optical
      cleaning head with an inelastic, polymeric, open-celled and rigid end that is
      not deformable (see applicant arguments pages 5-6). Although applicant makes
      no claim language to specify rigidity or \u201Cstiffness\u201D, examiner interprets
      the low density limitation to define an inelastic and rigid material as argued.

      by virtue of dependency.\\nAny comments considered necessary by applicant must

      of Pugh et al. (hereinafter \u201CPugh\u201D) (U.S. Pub. No. 2003/0190527A1,
      cited by Applicant).\\nRegarding claims 1-4, Pugh teaches a cathode active material
      compound represented by the formula:\\nAaMb(XY4)cZd\\n wherein A may be Li and
      0<a\u22649 (see paragraphs 11-14); M comprises M\u2019 and M\u2019\u2019, where
      M\u2019 is at least one transition metal from Groups 4 to 11 of the Periodic
      Table (Ti; M has an oxidation number of 4) and M\u2019\u2019 is at least one
      element from Groups 2, 3 and 12-16 of the Periodic Table (Mg and Al) (see paragraph
      21); 1\u2264b\u22643 (see paragraph 15); XY4 is PO4 (see paragraph 16); and
      0<c\u22643  (see paragraph 16).  Thus, a may range from 1 to 1.5; b may be 2
      and c may be 3 (lithium ion conductor represented by formula 1).  In the case
      where the claimed ranges \u201Coverlap or lie inside ranges disclosed by prior
      art\u201D a prima facie case of obviousness exists.  See In re Wertheim, 541
      F.2d 257, 191 USPQ 90 (CCPA 1976); In re Woodruff, 919 F.2d 1575, 16 USPQ2d
      1934 (Fed. Cir. 1990); In re Geisler, 116 F.3d 1465, 1469-71, 43 USPQ2d 1362,
      1365-66 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (see MPEP \xA7 2144.05).\\nPugh does not explicitly
      teach that the aluminum and magnesium of the above formula are substituted at
      a plurality of M sites of the lithium ion conductor.  It is noted, however,
      that Pugh teaches that when c=3, the cathode active material preferably has
      a NASICON structure (see Abstract).  This is the same structure described in
      paragraph 57 of the instant specification.  Thus, given that the cathode active
      material of Pugh may have the same crystal structure and may comprise the same
      composition as that of claimed lithium ion conductor, one of ordinary skill
      in the art would expect the aluminum and magnesium of Pugh to occupy the same
      crystallographic sites as the aluminum and magnesium of the claimed lithium
      ion conductor.\\n Claims 11, 13 and 14 are rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C.
      103(a) as being unpatentable Yokoyama et al. (hereinafter \u201CYokoyama\u201D)
      (U.S. Pub. No. 2013/0122376A1) in view of Pugh.\\nRegarding claims 11, 13 and
      14, Yokoyama teaches a lithium ion secondary battery 100 having a structure
      in which an insulating film 5, a positive electrode 2, a solid electrolyte layer
      3, and a negative electrode 4 are laminated in this order (all-solid-state battery)
      (see paragraph 87; Figure 1).  The positive electrode 2 comprises an active
      material layer 21 while the negative electrode 4 comprises an active material
      layer 41 (see paragraphs 88 and 89).  The material forming the active material
      layer 21 may comprise a lithium composite metal oxide.\\nYokoyama further teaches
      that an electrode active material may be mixed with a composition for forming
      the solid electrolyte.  As a result, the area of contact between the electrode
      active material and the solid electrolyte layer in a lithium ion secondary battery
      can be increased.  When the contact between the electrode active material and
      a solid electrolyte layer is increased, the amount of lithium ions involved
      in the battery reaction can be increased, and thereby the capacity of a battery
      can be further increased (see paragraph 70).  \\nYokoyama does not explicitly
      teach the lithium ion conductor represented by Formula 1.\\nPugh teaches a cathode
      active material compound represented by the formula:\\nAaMb(XY4)cZd\\n wherein
      A may be Li and 0<a\u22649 (see paragraphs 11-14); M comprises M\u2019 and M\u2019\u2019,

      teach that the aluminum and magnesium of the above formula are substituted at
      a plurality of M sites of the lithium ion conductor.  It is noted, however,
      that Pugh teaches that when c=3, the cathode active material preferably has
      a NASICON structure (see Abstract).  This is the same structure described in
      paragraph 57 of the instant specification.  Thus, given that the cathode active
      material of Pugh may have the same crystal structure and may comprise the same
      composition as that of claimed lithium ion conductor, one of ordinary skill
      in the art would expect the aluminum and magnesium of Pugh to occupy the same

      forth above, because Pugh teaches that the cathode active material affords benefits
      including increased capacity, enhanced cycling capability, enhanced reversibility,
      and reduced costs (see paragraph 22).\\n Claim 12 is rejected under pre-AIA

      103(a) as being unpatentable Yokoyama et al. (hereinafter \u201CYokoyama\u201D)
      (U.S. Pub. No. 2013/0122376A1) in view of Pugh.\\nRegarding claims 11, 13 and
      14, Yokoyama teaches a lithium ion secondary battery 100 having a structure
      in which an insulating film 5, a positive electrode 2, a solid electrolyte layer
      3, and a negative electrode 4 are laminated in this order (all-solid-state battery)
      (see paragraph 87; Figure 1).  The positive electrode 2 comprises an active
      material layer 21 while the negative electrode 4 comprises an active material
      layer 41 (see paragraphs 88 and 89).  The material forming the active material
      layer 21 may comprise a lithium composite metal oxide.\\nYokoyama further teaches
      that an electrode active material may be mixed with a composition for forming
      the solid electrolyte.  As a result, the area of contact between the electrode
      active material and the solid electrolyte layer in a lithium ion secondary battery
      can be increased.  When the contact between the electrode active material and
      a solid electrolyte layer is increased, the amount of lithium ions involved
      in the battery reaction can be increased, and thereby the capacity of a battery
      can be further increased (see paragraph 70).  \\nYokoyama does not explicitly
      teach the lithium ion conductor represented by Formula 1.\\nPugh teaches a cathode
      active material compound represented by the formula:\\nAaMb(XY4)cZd\\n wherein
      A may be Li and 0<a\u22649 (see paragraphs 11-14); M comprises M\u2019 and M\u2019\u2019,

      Table (Ti; M has an oxidation number of 4) and M\u2019\u2019 is at least one
      element from Groups 2, 3 and 12-16 of the Periodic Table (Mg and Al) (see paragraph

      have been fully considered but they are not persuasive.\\nApplicant\u2019s principal
      arguments are as follows:\\nA)\\tThe active material Pugh is at least one of
      the active materials listed in paragraph 94.\\nB)\\tUnlike the lithium ion conductor
      of the claimed invention, the total sum of the transition metal of the active
      material disclosed in Pugh is not 2.\\nC)\\tThe active material of Pugh has
      an olivine structure (LiMPO4).  However, the claimed lithium ion conductor has
      Lia(AlMg)2(PO4)3 where 1.2<a<1.4.  In Lia(AlMg)2(PO4)3- where a>1, the lithium
      ion conductor does not have the LiMPO4 structure.  Therefore, the claimed lithium
      ion conductor has different composition and structure compared with the active
      material of Pugh.\\nD)\\tPugh fails to teach the limitation of the aluminum
      and the magnesium of formula 1 are substituted at a plurality of M sites of
      the lithium ion conductor of Formula 1 of claim 1 according the claimed invention.\\n\\nIn
      response to Applicant\u2019s arguments, please consider the following comments:\\tA)\\tPugh
      is in no way limited to the exemplary embodiments disclosed in paragraph 94.
      \ Disclosed examples and preferred embodiments do not constitute a teaching
      away from a broader disclosure or nonpreferred embodiments. In re Susi, 440
      F.2d 442, 169 USPQ 423 (CCPA 1971) (See MPEP \xA7 2123).\\n B)\\tIn the chemical
      formula of Pugh, AaMb(XY4)cZd, b may be 2.\\nC)\\tThe active material of Pugh
      only has the olivine structure when c=1.  When c=3, the active material of Pugh
      has the NASICON structure. This is the same structure described in paragraph
      57 of the instant specification.\\nD)\\t Because the cathode active material
      of Pugh may have the same crystal structure and may comprise the same composition
      as that of claimed lithium ion conductor, one of ordinary skill in the art would
      expect the aluminum and magnesium of Pugh to occupy the same crystallographic
      sites as the aluminum and magnesium of the claimed lithium ion conductor.\\n\\nConclusion\\nApplicant's

      action.  Accordingly, THIS ACTION IS MADE FINAL.  See MPEP \xA7 706.07(a).  Applicant

      transaction data, ([0128] shows, the POS data may be automatically transmitted
      to the facts database after the sales information has been collected at the
      stores POS terminals.);\\nsegmenting consumers into a plurality of statistical
      segments based on one or more consumer attributes, ([0313], The methods and
      systems disclosed herein provide shopper insights into buying behavior (e.g.,
      share of-wallet and leakage) based on trip missions, consumer segments, neighborhoods,
      channels and stores, as well as other custom clusters of attributes; [0657]
      Further, the plurality of overlapping attribute segments may include a product
      attribute, a consumer attribute, and the like. The  product attribute may be
      a nutritional level, a brand, a product category, and physical attributes such
      as flavor, scent, packaging type, product launch date, display location, and
      the like. The product attribute may be based at least in on a SKU; [1391] In
      embodiments, a household panel data set may be taken from which it is desired
      to obtain a projection for an analytic purpose relating to analyzing motivations
      of a customer segment to purchase products. A core information matrix may be
      developed for the household panel data set, where the core information matrix
      may include regions representing the statistical characteristics of alternative
      projection techniques that can be applied to the household panel data set. In
      addition, a user interface may be provided whereby a user can observe the regions
      of the core information matrix to facilitate selecting an appropriate projection

      above, and steps thereof, may be realized in hardware, software, or any combination
      of these suitable for a particular application. The hardware may include a general-purpose
      computer and/or dedicated computing device. The processes may be realized in
      one or more microprocessors, microcontrollers, embedded microcontrollers, programmable
      digital signal processors or other programmable device, along with internal

      using a processor, segment wide point of sales data by at least one consumer
      group,  ([0128], In this case, the causal store information may be aggregated
      with the POS data and dimension data corresponding to the products referred
      to in the POS data. With this aggregation of information one can make an analysis
      on any of the related data. [0328] In an embodiment, the analytic platform 100
      comprises a consumer tracking and targeting facility. The consumer tracking
      and targeting facility may provide consumer data integration for in-depth behavior
      analysis, and targeting at the individual household level detail. The consumer
      tracking and targeting facility may apply data fusion methods to integrate disparate
      consumer data sources supported by a comprehensive household and store master.
      The methodology may improve tracking of channels with limited coverage, such
      as with certain retailers. The consumer tracking and targeting facility may
      provide a more accurate profiling of individual stores based on actual household
      demographics within a local trading area, incorporating real-world considerations
      such as multi-store competitive effects and shopper store preference for different
      categories. The consumer tracking and targeting facility may be based on a comprehensive
      base of a large number of households and a complete store list. The consumer
      master includes an extensive set of demographic and purchasing behavior attributes,
      and several derived segmentations, such as life stage. The store list may include
      both grocery retail stores and other stores. The consumer tracking and targeting
      facility may implement consumer data fusion methodology for mapping and statistical
      data fusion across different types of consumer data, resulting in increased
      data  accuracy, reduced sample bias, extended data scope, and the like. [1662]
      In embodiments, a projected facts table in a loyalty card market basket data
      set may be taken that has one or more associated dimensions. At least one of
      the dimensions to be fixed may be selected, where the selection of a dimension
      may be based on an analytic purpose relating to determining consumer motivation
      for a purchase event. An aggregation of projected facts from the projected facts
      table and associated dimensions may be produced, where the aggregation may fix
      the selected dimension for the purpose of allowing queries on the aggregated
      loyalty card market basket data set. In addition, product affinities across
      a plurality of channels may be determined, where product affinity information
      may be used to create a conclusion relating to at least one of a behavioral
      customer segment, a trip mission, and a neighborhood cluster.)\\ntransforming,
      using a processor, validated aggregated segment wide point of sales data, ([1202]
      Referring to FIG. 63, the analytic platform may build a data architecture. The
      data architecture may include federation/consolidation approach, IRI analytic
      data approach or some other approach. In embodiment, the federation/consolidation
      approach may aggregate data received from multiple data feed. The data received
      from multiple feed may include updating in all parts of the process. The data
      feeds may be connected to a master data system by a defined structure facility
      and a map master data facility. The map master facility may provide mapping
      of data received from data structure facility and convert it into a format acceptable
      by master data system. The master data system may be connected to a data warehouse
      through order data facility  and data alignment facility. The cube build facility
      may transform the aggregated data received from warehouse into multiple data
      cubes)  \\noutputting transformed segment wide point of sales data to the price
      optimization system for generation of preferred prices, ([1363] In embodiments,
      a promotion characteristic data set having a plurality of dimensions may be
      taken. A dimension of the promotion characteristic data set may be fixed for
      purposes of pre-aggregating the data in the promotion characteristic data set
      for the fixed dimension, where the fixed dimension may be selected based on
      suitability of the pre-aggregation to facilitate rapidly serving an analytic
      purpose relating to optimizing a proposed product mix for retail marketing.
      An analytic query of the promotion characteristic data set may be allowed, where
      the query may be executed using pre-aggregated data if the query does not seek
      to vary the fixed dimension and the query is executed on the un-aggregated promotion
      characteristic data set if the query seeks to vary the fixed dimension. [1352]
      In embodiments, optimization may reduce a business problem to a set of mathematical
      equations. The equations may be composed of marketing activity variables, model-based
      measures of response, marketing costs, and product margins. Once this set of
      equations is fixed, the inputs may be systematically varied until the objective
      is optimized, resulting in weekly advertising, promotion, and pricing levels
      that maximize revenue, margin, or a combination of the two. The optimization
      module uses advanced mathematical algorithms to handle complex problems involving
      even 0-1 decision variables and large numbers of detailed constraints. This
      engine has handled very  large-scale problems, such as optimizing over 100,000
      decisions in minutes using an \\\"interior point\\\" algorithm).\\nWherein each
      statistical segment is associated with a different set of consumer attributes,
      ([0160] Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) was originally designed by Deming
      and Stephan (1940) for adjustment of frequencies in contingency tables. IPF
      has been applied to several problems in different domains but is particularly
      useful in census and sample-related analysis, to provide updated population
      statistics and to estimate individual-level attribute characteristics.)\\nProviding
      consistent associations of the consumers with corresponding statistical segments,
      ([0307] In embodiments, attributes may be tracked to enable consistent analysis
      of attributes, dimensions, or clusters of attributes over time, such as to provide
      longitudinal analysis of market characteristics, as compared to ad hoc analysis
      currently used in market analytics.),\\nconsolidating the plurality of statistical
      segments to produce the consumer segments, wherein the consolidating includes
      selectively combining a plurality of the statistical segments to form at least
      one of the consumer segments, ([0154], In embodiments the projection facility
      178 may assess one or more user-defined criteria in order to identify one or
      more projections that potentially satisfy the criteria. These candidate projections
      (which consist of various potential weightings in a projection matrix), can
      be presented  to a user along with information about the statistical properties
      of the candidate weightings, such as relating to accuracy, consistency, reliability
      and the like, thereby enabling a user to select a set of projection weightings
      that satisfy the user's criteria as to those statistical properties or that
      provide a user-optimized projection based on those statistical properties. Each
      weighting of the projection matrix thus reflects either a weighting that would
      be obtained using a known methodology or a weighting that represents a combination
      or fusion of known methodologies; [0328] In an embodiment, the analytic platform
      100 comprises a consumer tracking and targeting facility. The consumer tracking
      and targeting facility may provide consumer data integration for in-depth behavior
      analysis, and targeting at the individual household level detail. The consumer
      tracking and targeting facility may apply data fusion methods to integrate disparate
      consumer data sources supported by a comprehensive household and store master.
      The methodology may improve tracking of channels with limited coverage, such
      as with certain retailers. The consumer tracking and targeting facility may
      provide a more accurate profiling of individual stores based on actual household
      demographics within a local trading area, incorporating real-world considerations
      such as multi-store competitive effects and shopper store preference for different
      categories. The consumer tracking and targeting facility may be based on a comprehensive
      base of a large number of households and a complete store list. The consumer
      master includes an extensive set of demographic and purchasing behavior attributes,
      and several derived segmentations, such as life stage. The store list may include
      both grocery retail stores and other stores. The consumer tracking and targeting
      facility may implement consumer  data fusion methodology for mapping and statistical
      data fusion across different types of consumer data, resulting in increased
      data accuracy, reduced sample bias, extended data scope, and the like. The consumer
      tracking and targeting facility may enable consumer tracking. The integration
      across multiple data sources enables a comprehensive view of total consumer
      behavior, with the ability to include a broader set of demographic and economic
      attributes to identify effective consumer clusters in each market. The consumer
      tracking and targeting facility may enable consumer targeting. The resulting
      analyses and segmentation may be linked directly to individual households for
      highly accurate targeting and direct to consumer marketing. The consumer tracking
      and targeting facility may enable extensibility to new data sources. The consumer
      tracking and targeting facility is built on an open and extensible data platform
      to allow for rapid inclusion of additional consumer data, such as client managed
      consumer surveys or specialized consumer panels. The consumer tracking and targeting
      facility enables comprehensive consumer and store models by relying on continuously
      updated information for up-to-date trend analysis of ethnicity and population.
      The consumer tracking and targeting facility enables integration of multiple
      consumer data sources. The consumer data fusion methodology enables integration
      of multiple sources of consumer data, including Frequent Shopper Data, Household
      Panel data, Shopper Survey Data, and the like. The consumer tracking and targeting
      facility enables more actionable insights. Granular household information supports
      precise household level targeting, to feed tactical merchandising processes
      and systems for neighborhood-level strategies in assortment, pricing, and promotion
      actions.)\\nHunt et al does not specifically disclose determining a percentage
      fit score for consumers indicating a degree of relevance of the consumers to
      corresponding statistical segments;  meshing the plurality of statistical segments
      to produce consumer segments, wherein meshing includes:  applying the percentage
      fit score to provide associations of the consumers with corresponding statistical
      segments, however, Eder discloses in col. 49, line 66-col. 50, line 53, \\\"
      The software in the customer payment analysis subsystem 76 (FIG. 2) completes
      the forecast of sales and cash receipts one customer group at a time. The first
      step in completing the forecast of sales and cash receipts by customer group
      is completed by the software in a processing block 352 which determines if the
      user 60 has previously assigned a customer group to all customers. If the user
      60 hasn't assigned any customer groups, then the software in block 352 transfers
      processing to a block 353 which creates customer groupings based on the longevity
      of the customer's association with the company and the frequency of the customer's
      purchase of goods and services. The software in block 353 assigns each customer
      to a group based on the customer's order frequency and first purchase date in
      a manner similar to that shown in Table 56\u2026The number of categories is
      set by the software in block 353 to 170 with 10 order frequency divisions (0-10%,
      11-20%, 21-30% etc,) with 17 time period groups (as shown above) using the current
      system date as the reference date. It is possible to have the number of categories
      dynamically determined by the software in block 353 but that option was not
      included in the preferred embodiment. The customer groupings established by
      the software in block 353 are then  saved to the customer group master file
      158 and the group set by variable (`grp.sub.-- set`) is set to `s` to signify
      that the system established the customer groups. Processing then advances to
      a block 356 where each customer is assigned to a group based on its longevity
      and order frequency history. The customer master file 156 is modified to reflect
      the newly assigned customer groups. Processing then advances to a block 357
      where a forecast of new customer additions is completed\u201D. ALSO SEE col.
      27, lines 29-47 \u201CAll forecasts are adjusted to exactly match the controlling
      forecast in every time period. The first step in the adjustment of the forecast
      involves segregating each individual account, customer group or item forecast
      into a different sub-group or segment based on relative TVO value. If the user
      didn't specify the number of TVO categories for the forecast being adjusted
      then the system uses a default value of four segments. The changes required
      to bring each period forecast in line with the controlling forecast for the
      period are then preferentially spread to the most appropriate segments. For
      example, if the item sales forecast for the first period needed to be increased
      to match the controlling sales forecast for that period and there were four
      categories specified for item TVO, then the application software of the present
      system would segregate the items into four groups with group four having 25%
      of the items with the lowest TVO values, group three having 25% of the items
      with the next highest TVO values, group two having 25% of the items with the
      next highest TVO values and group one having 25% of the items with the highest
      TVO values. If there were no segment rankings specified, then the system would
      use the default values and spread: four-sevenths of the required increase on
      a proportional basis (each item would be number='10'increased by the same percentage)
      to the items in group 1, two-sevenths of the required period increase on a proportional
      basis to the items in group 2 and one-seventh of the required period increase
      on a proportional basis to the items in group 3. No adjustment would be made
      to the group with the lowest TVO values, group 4. All sales and cash receipt
      forecasts are adjusted in a similar fashion using the relative TVO values (with
      the O variable having a zero weighting for account and customer forecasts) as
      the basis for preferential increase or decrease to the forecast for each period.
      The number of TVO segments and the relative weighting each segment receives
      can be changed by the user from the default values used in the example above.
      The relative weightings and number of segments used for TVO calculation are
      stored in the customer group TVO table, account TVO table and item TVO table\u201D\\nIt
      would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the

      segments; meshing the statistical segments to produce consumer segments, where
      the meshing includes determining and applying a percentage fit for consumers

      including the fee set forth in 37 CFR 1.17(e), was filed in this application
      after final rejection.  Since this application is eligible for continued examination
      under 37 CFR 1.114, and the fee set forth in 37 CFR 1.17(e) has been timely
      paid, the finality of the previous Office action has been withdrawn pursuant
      to 37 CFR 1.114.  Applicant's submission filed on 5/5/14 has been entered.\\n
      \\nStatus of Claims\\nDue to communications filed 5/5/14, the following is a
      non-final office action.  Claims 1, 11, 21, 28 and 29 are amended.  Claims 9
      and 19 are cancelled.  Claims 1-8, 10-18, and 20-29 are pending in this application
      and have been examined on the merits.  The previous rejection has been amended
      to reflect claim amendments.\\n\\n\\nClaim Rejections - 35 USC \xA7 101\\n35
      U.S.C. 101 reads as follows:\\nWhoever invents or discovers any new and useful
      process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful
      improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions
      and requirements of this title.\\n\\n\\nClaims 1-29 are rejected under 35 U.S.C.
      101 because the claimed invention is directed to non-statutory subject matter.\\nClaim[s]
      1-29 is/are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 101 because the claimed invention is directed
      to non-statutory subject matter because the claimed invention is not directed
      to patent eligible subject matter.  Based upon consideration of all of the relevant
      factors with respect to the claim as a whole, claim(s) 1-29 is/are determined
      to be directed to an abstract idea.  The rationale for this determination is
      explained below:  Examples of abstract ideas include fundamental economic practices;
      certain methods of organizing human activities; an idea of itself, and; mathematical
      relationships/formulas.  Claims 1-29 include certain methods of organizing human
      activities.  \\nFurther, no element or combination of elements in the claim[s]
      is sufficient to ensure that the claim[s] amounts to significantly more than
      the abstract idea itself, for example, by including: improvements to another
      technology or technical field; improvements to the functioning of the computer
      itself, or; meaningful limitations beyond generally linking the use of an abstract
      idea to a particular technological environment.  Claims 1-29 do not amount to
      significantly more than the abstract idea itself since they require no more
      than a generic computer to perform generic computer functions (e.g. updating
      and storing data) that are well-understood, routine and conventional activities
      previously known to the industry.  See Alice Corporation Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank
      International. \\n\\n\\n\\n Claim Rejections - 35 USC \xA7 103\\nThe following
      is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 103(a) which forms the basis for all obviousness
      rejections set forth in this Office action:\\n(a) A patent may not be obtained
      though the invention is not identically disclosed or described as set forth
      in section 102 of this title, if the differences between the subject matter
      sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as
      a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person
      having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.  Patentability
      shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made.\\n\\nClaims
      1-4, 6-8, 10-14, 16-18, 20-24, 26-29 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as
      being unpatentable over Hunt et al, (US 20090018996 A1), and further in view
      of Eder (US 5615109).\\n\\nAs per claim 1, Hunt et al discloses:\\n\\nreceiving
      customer transaction data, ([0128] shows, the POS data may be automatically
      transmitted to the facts database after the sales information has been collected
      at the stores POS terminals.);\\nsegmenting consumers into a plurality of statistical
      segments based on one or more consumer attributes, ([0313], The methods and
      systems disclosed herein provide shopper insights into buying behavior (e.g.,
      share of-wallet and leakage) based on trip missions, consumer segments, neighborhoods,
      channels and stores, as well as other custom clusters of attributes; [0657]
      Further, the plurality of overlapping attribute segments may include a product
      attribute, a consumer attribute, and the like. The  product attribute may be
      a nutritional level, a brand, a product category, and physical attributes such
      as flavor, scent, packaging type, product launch date, display location, and
      the like. The product attribute may be based at least in on a SKU; [1391] In
      embodiments, a household panel data set may be taken from which it is desired
      to obtain a projection for an analytic purpose relating to analyzing motivations
      of a customer segment to purchase products. A core information matrix may be
      developed for the household panel data set, where the core information matrix
      may include regions representing the statistical characteristics of alternative
      projection techniques that can be applied to the household panel data set. In
      addition, a user interface may be provided whereby a user can observe the regions
      of the core information matrix to facilitate selecting an appropriate projection
      technique.);\\n\\nusing a processor, ([1802] The methods or processes described
      above, and steps thereof, may be realized in hardware, software, or any combination
      of these suitable for a particular application. The hardware may include a general-purpose
      computer and/or dedicated computing device. The processes may be realized in
      one or more microprocessors, microcontrollers, embedded microcontrollers, programmable
      digital signal processors or other programmable device, along with internal
      and/or external memory.)\\n\\ngenerating segment wide point of sales data, ([0718],
      [0719], shows POS data for household and trip segmentation.);\\n\\naggregating,
      using a processor, segment wide point of sales data by at least one consumer
      group,  ([0128], In this case, the causal store information may be aggregated
      with the POS data and dimension data corresponding to the products referred
      to in the POS data. With this aggregation of information one can make an analysis
      on any of the related data. [0328] In an embodiment, the analytic platform 100
      comprises a consumer tracking and targeting facility. The consumer tracking
      and targeting facility may provide consumer data integration for in-depth behavior
      analysis, and targeting at the individual household level detail. The consumer
      tracking and targeting facility may apply data fusion methods to integrate disparate
      consumer data sources supported by a comprehensive household and store master.
      The methodology may improve tracking of channels with limited coverage, such
      as with certain retailers. The consumer tracking and targeting facility may
      provide a more accurate profiling of individual stores based on actual household
      demographics within a local trading area, incorporating real-world considerations
      such as multi-store competitive effects and shopper store preference for different
      categories. The consumer tracking and targeting facility may be based on a comprehensive
      base of a large number of households and a complete store list. The consumer
      master includes an extensive set of demographic and purchasing behavior attributes,
      and several derived segmentations, such as life stage. The store list may include
      both grocery retail stores and other stores. The consumer tracking and targeting
      facility may implement consumer data fusion methodology for mapping and statistical
      data fusion across different types of consumer data, resulting in increased
      data  accuracy, reduced sample bias, extended data scope, and the like. [1662]
      In embodiments, a projected facts table in a loyalty card market basket data
      set may be taken that has one or more associated dimensions. At least one of
      the dimensions to be fixed may be selected, where the selection of a dimension
      may be based on an analytic purpose relating to determining consumer motivation
      for a purchase event. An aggregation of projected facts from the projected facts
      table and associated dimensions may be produced, where the aggregation may fix
      the selected dimension for the purpose of allowing queries on the aggregated
      loyalty card market basket data set. In addition, product affinities across
      a plurality of channels may be determined, where product affinity information
      may be used to create a conclusion relating to at least one of a behavioral
      customer segment, a trip mission, and a neighborhood cluster.)\\n\\ntransforming,
      using a processor, validated aggregated segment wide point of sales data, ([1202]
      Referring to FIG. 63, the analytic platform may build a data architecture. The
      data architecture may include federation/consolidation approach, IRI analytic
      data approach or some other approach. In embodiment, the federation/consolidation
      approach may aggregate data received from multiple data feed. The data received
      from multiple feed may include updating in all parts of the process. The data
      feeds may be connected to a master data system by a defined structure facility
      and a map master data facility. The map master facility may provide mapping
      of data received from data structure facility and convert it into a format acceptable
      by master data system. The master data system may be connected to a data warehouse
      through order data facility  and data alignment facility. The cube build facility
      may transform the aggregated data received from warehouse into multiple data
      cubes)  \\n\\noutputting transformed segment wide point of sales data to the
      price optimization system for generation of preferred prices, ([1363] In embodiments,
      a promotion characteristic data set having a plurality of dimensions may be
      taken. A dimension of the promotion characteristic data set may be fixed for
      purposes of pre-aggregating the data in the promotion characteristic data set
      for the fixed dimension, where the fixed dimension may be selected based on
      suitability of the pre-aggregation to facilitate rapidly serving an analytic
      purpose relating to optimizing a proposed product mix for retail marketing.
      An analytic query of the promotion characteristic data set may be allowed, where
      the query may be executed using pre-aggregated data if the query does not seek
      to vary the fixed dimension and the query is executed on the un-aggregated promotion
      characteristic data set if the query seeks to vary the fixed dimension. [1352]
      In embodiments, optimization may reduce a business problem to a set of mathematical
      equations. The equations may be composed of marketing activity variables, model-based
      measures of response, marketing costs, and product margins. Once this set of
      equations is fixed, the inputs may be systematically varied until the objective
      is optimized, resulting in weekly advertising, promotion, and pricing levels
      that maximize revenue, margin, or a combination of the two. The optimization
      module uses advanced mathematical algorithms to handle complex problems involving
      even 0-1 decision variables and large numbers of detailed constraints. This
      engine has handled very  large-scale problems, such as optimizing over 100,000
      decisions in minutes using an \\\"interior point\\\" algorithm).\\nWherein each
      statistical segment is associated with a different set of consumer attributes,
      ([0160] Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) was originally designed by Deming
      and Stephan (1940) for adjustment of frequencies in contingency tables. IPF
      has been applied to several problems in different domains but is particularly
      useful in census and sample-related analysis, to provide updated population
      statistics and to estimate individual-level attribute characteristics.)\\n\\nProviding
      consistent associations of the consumers with corresponding statistical segments,
      ([0307] In embodiments, attributes may be tracked to enable consistent analysis
      of attributes, dimensions, or clusters of attributes over time, such as to provide
      longitudinal analysis of market characteristics, as compared to ad hoc analysis
      currently used in market analytics.),\\n\\nconsolidating the plurality of statistical
      segments to produce the consumer segments, wherein the consolidating includes
      selectively combining a plurality of the statistical segments to form at least
      one of the consumer segments, ([0154], In embodiments the projection facility
      178 may assess one or more user-defined criteria in order to identify one or
      more projections that potentially satisfy the criteria. These candidate projections
      (which consist of various potential weightings in a projection matrix), can
      be presented  to a user along with information about the statistical properties
      of the candidate weightings, such as relating to accuracy, consistency, reliability
      and the like, thereby enabling a user to select a set of projection weightings
      that satisfy the user's criteria as to those statistical properties or that
      provide a user-optimized projection based on those statistical properties. Each
      weighting of the projection matrix thus reflects either a weighting that would
      be obtained using a known methodology or a weighting that represents a combination
      or fusion of known methodologies; [0328] In an embodiment, the analytic platform
      100 comprises a consumer tracking and targeting facility. The consumer tracking
      and targeting facility may provide consumer data integration for in-depth behavior
      analysis, and targeting at the individual household level detail. The consumer
      tracking and targeting facility may apply data fusion methods to integrate disparate
      consumer data sources supported by a comprehensive household and store master.
      The methodology may improve tracking of channels with limited coverage, such
      as with certain retailers. The consumer tracking and targeting facility may
      provide a more accurate profiling of individual stores based on actual household
      demographics within a local trading area, incorporating real-world considerations
      such as multi-store competitive effects and shopper store preference for different
      categories. The consumer tracking and targeting facility may be based on a comprehensive
      base of a large number of households and a complete store list. The consumer
      master includes an extensive set of demographic and purchasing behavior attributes,
      and several derived segmentations, such as life stage. The store list may include
      both grocery retail stores and other stores. The consumer tracking and targeting
      facility may implement consumer  data fusion methodology for mapping and statistical
      data fusion across different types of consumer data, resulting in increased
      data accuracy, reduced sample bias, extended data scope, and the like. The consumer
      tracking and targeting facility may enable consumer tracking. The integration
      across multiple data sources enables a comprehensive view of total consumer
      behavior, with the ability to include a broader set of demographic and economic
      attributes to identify effective consumer clusters in each market. The consumer
      tracking and targeting facility may enable consumer targeting. The resulting
      analyses and segmentation may be linked directly to individual households for
      highly accurate targeting and direct to consumer marketing. The consumer tracking
      and targeting facility may enable extensibility to new data sources. The consumer
      tracking and targeting facility is built on an open and extensible data platform
      to allow for rapid inclusion of additional consumer data, such as client managed
      consumer surveys or specialized consumer panels. The consumer tracking and targeting
      facility enables comprehensive consumer and store models by relying on continuously
      updated information for up-to-date trend analysis of ethnicity and population.
      The consumer tracking and targeting facility enables integration of multiple
      consumer data sources. The consumer data fusion methodology enables integration
      of multiple sources of consumer data, including Frequent Shopper Data, Household
      Panel data, Shopper Survey Data, and the like. The consumer tracking and targeting
      facility enables more actionable insights. Granular household information supports
      precise household level targeting, to feed tactical merchandising processes
      and systems for neighborhood-level strategies in assortment, pricing, and promotion
      actions.)\\n\\nHunt et al does not specifically disclose determining a percentage
      fit score for consumers indicating a degree of relevance of the consumers to
      corresponding statistical segments;  meshing the plurality of statistical segments
      to produce consumer segments, wherein meshing includes:  applying the percentage
      fit score to provide associations of the consumers with corresponding statistical
      segments, however, Eder discloses in col. 49, line 66-col. 50, line 53, \\\"
      The software in the customer payment analysis subsystem 76 (FIG. 2) completes
      the forecast of sales and cash receipts one customer group at a time. The first
      step in completing the forecast of sales and cash receipts by customer group
      is completed by the software in a processing block 352 which determines if the
      user 60 has previously assigned a customer group to all customers. If the user
      60 hasn't assigned any customer groups, then the software in block 352 transfers
      processing to a block 353 which creates customer groupings based on the longevity
      of the customer's association with the company and the frequency of the customer's
      purchase of goods and services. The software in block 353 assigns each customer
      to a group based on the customer's order frequency and first purchase date in
      a manner similar to that shown in Table 56\u2026The number of categories is
      set by the software in block 353 to 170 with 10 order frequency divisions (0-10%,
      11-20%, 21-30% etc,) with 17 time period groups (as shown above) using the current
      system date as the reference date. It is possible to have the number of categories
      dynamically determined by the software in block 353 but that option was not
      included in the preferred embodiment. The customer groupings established by
      the software in block 353 are then  saved to the customer group master file
      158 and the group set by variable (`grp.sub.-- set`) is set to `s` to signify
      that the system established the customer groups. Processing then advances to
      a block 356 where each customer is assigned to a group based on its longevity
      and order frequency history. The customer master file 156 is modified to reflect
      the newly assigned customer groups. Processing then advances to a block 357
      where a forecast of new customer additions is completed\u201D. ALSO SEE col.
      27, lines 29-47 \u201CAll forecasts are adjusted to exactly match the controlling
      forecast in every time period. The first step in the adjustment of the forecast
      involves segregating each individual account, customer group or item forecast
      into a different sub-group or segment based on relative TVO value. If the user
      didn't specify the number of TVO categories for the forecast being adjusted
      then the system uses a default value of four segments. The changes required
      to bring each period forecast in line with the controlling forecast for the
      period are then preferentially spread to the most appropriate segments. For
      example, if the item sales forecast for the first period needed to be increased
      to match the controlling sales forecast for that period and there were four
      categories specified for item TVO, then the application software of the present
      system would segregate the items into four groups with group four having 25%
      of the items with the lowest TVO values, group three having 25% of the items
      with the next highest TVO values, group two having 25% of the items with the
      next highest TVO values and group one having 25% of the items with the highest
      TVO values. If there were no segment rankings specified, then the system would
      use the default values and spread: four-sevenths of the required increase on
      a proportional basis (each item would be number='10'increased by the same percentage)
      to the items in group 1, two-sevenths of the required period increase on a proportional
      basis to the items in group 2 and one-seventh of the required period increase
      on a proportional basis to the items in group 3. No adjustment would be made
      to the group with the lowest TVO values, group 4. All sales and cash receipt
      forecasts are adjusted in a similar fashion using the relative TVO values (with
      the O variable having a zero weighting for account and customer forecasts) as
      the basis for preferential increase or decrease to the forecast for each period.
      The number of TVO segments and the relative weighting each segment receives
      can be changed by the user from the default values used in the example above.
      The relative weightings and number of segments used for TVO calculation are
      stored in the customer group TVO table, account TVO table and item TVO table\u201D\\n\\nIt

      20090018996 A1), and further in view of Eder (US 5615109, and further in view
      of Newman et al (US 20050055275 A1).\\n\\n\\nAs per claims 5, 15, 25 Hunt et
      al nor Eder do not specifically disclose wherein the segmenting customers includes
      segmenting point of sale records belonging to a consumer with a known identification
      to a segment which the consumer already belongs to, however, Newman discloses
      in [0130] \u201CProcess #3: A client could analyze point of sale (POS) SKU-level
      buyer segments by passing an encrypted version of the sixteen number='14'digit
      card holder number across the firewall. The MIR environment can de-encrypt the
      account number and can then link the account number to an identification key
      and determine to which attributes segments the customer belongs. As in Process
      #2, these attributes are then matched to the MIR transaction warehouse and the
      relevant customer set is selected. The buying behaviors of the aggregated set
      is computed and returned across the firewall. In other words, when the merchant
      sends over the key, the customer is be identified by the MIR system 300 for
      internal purposes but what goes back is couched in segment or \\\"birds of a
      feather\\\" terms.\u201D\\n\\nIt therefore would be obvious to one of ordinary
      skill in the art at the time of the applicant\u2019s invention to disclose wherein
      the segmenting customers includes segmenting point of sale records belonging
      to a consumer with a known identification to a segment which the consumer already
      belongs to with the motivation of identifying a customer with a particular segment.\\nResponse
      to Arguments\\nApplicant\u2019s arguments, see response, filed 5/5/14, with
      respect to the rejection(s) of claim(s) 21-29 under 35 U.S.C. 101 have been
      fully considered and are persuasive.  Therefore, the rejection has been withdrawn.
      \ However, upon further consideration, a new ground(s) of rejection is made
      in view of 35 U.S.C. 101 under Alice Corporation Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank International.
      \\n\\n\\nApplicant's arguments filed 5/5/14 have been fully considered but they
      are not persuasive. \\nApplicant makes several amendments to the claims.  However,
      examiner has re-evaluated prior art used.  As shown above in the rejection,
      the combination of the Hunt, (20090018996 A1), Eder (US 5615109, and Newman
      et al (US 20050055275) references disclose the claims as amended.  Examiner
      has made new citations using prior art as demonstrated above in the rejection.\\n\\n\\nConclusion\\nAny

      Claim 1 (amended), Finkle discloses a remote control electric powered skateboard
      having a board with an upper rider-support surface and a lower surface supporting
      a plurality of wheels, and further comprising: a remote control [at least see
      Finkle fig 1 (char 12); fig 11]; a controller, wherein the remote control communicates
      with the controller \u2026 a receiver [at least see Finkle fig 10 which discloses
      a transmitter (char 54) a receiver (char 45) and a speed control (char 48) connected
      to a motor (char 22)]; a [electric] motor installed on  said lower surface of
      said skateboard connected to a battery device that provides said [electric]
      motor with a driving power through the controller [at least see Finkle Abstract;
      Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; a driving device disposed between said [electric] motor
      and at least one of said wheels [at least see Finkle Figs. 2, 3 at (20), (21)
      (22), (23), (24), (25), (26)]; said [electric] motor controlled by the remote
      control [at least see Finkle Abstract; Fig 1 at (12), Figs. 10, 11] \u2026 thereby
      allowing various actions pursuant to said signals emitted from said remote control
      to be implemented by said skateboard [at least see Finkle Abstract; column 1,
      lines 5567], ... said [electric] motor utilizing an instant obverse-reverse
      rotation characteristic to trigger said brake; while a braking signal being
      emitted from said remote control, said controller would thence emit a counter
      current to said [electric] [electric] [at least see Finkle Abstract; column
      1, lines 55-67, column 3, lines 48], but does not disclose communication via
      dual frequencies.  However, Kagaya teaches this limitation [at least see Kagaya
      Abstract; para. 0020 which teaches a remote control system that has a dual tone
      multifrequency signal generating unit and a retransmission unit which reads
      on said remote control communicates with said controller through dual frequencies.]\\nAccordingly,
      it would be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time
      of the invention to modify the teaching of Finkle to use multiple frequencies
      as taught by Kagaya because in radio controlled transmissions, simultaneous
      transmissions from a common base through the same frequency is difficult when
      there is a possibility of interference among other signals. (Kagaya 0008).\\nFinkle
      does not explicitly disclose a brushless motor.  However, Gass teaches use of
      a brushless motor [at least see Gass para. 0064, 0078, 0086 which teaches using
      a brushless motor for a battery operated power drill].  \\n Accordingly, it
      would be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of
      the invention to modify the teaching of Finkle to include a brushless motor
      as taught by Gass because brushless motors are more reliable, require less maintenance,
      increased efficiency, and electric reversing (Gass 0064).\\nFinkle does not
      disclose the controller provides an automatic comparison function; when said
      remote control subjected to electrification allowing an automatic generation
      of an initial code for permitting the controller to execute a spontaneous identification
      and automatically un-lock said initial code; wherein an automatic decoding being
      carried on after said remote control is shut off; said receiver receiving control
      signals emitted from said remote control, said controller thence decoding said
      signals so as to dispatch distinct commands to said brushless motor.  However,
      and McCabe reads of this limitation [at least see McCabe Figs. 3, 4; paras.
      0023, 0025, 0028, 0029 which teaches a wireless control system for a pallet
      truck which includes a processor which turns the input signal into a digital
      signal applies an encryption code to said digital signal and transmits the encrypted
      signal to the receiver on the pallet truck and a receiver on the pallet truck
      which demodulates the signal and compares it to the encryption code that is
      stored in memory if the encryption code is correct, the signal is passed to
      the controller on the pallet truck].\\nAccordingly, it would be obvious to a
      person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to modify
      the teaching of Finkle to include the signal encryption as taught by McCabe
      in order to distinguish the control signals from multiple operators when multiple
      vehicles are being operated in the same vicinity (McCabe 0028).\\nFinkle does
      not disclose wherein the remote control automatically generates the initial
      code for permitting the controller to execute the spontaneous identification
      and automatically un-lock said initial code and to automatically decode and
      relock the initial code when the remote  control is shut off or beyond a detection
      distance from the receiver at a first frequency of the dual frequencies and
      wherein the control signals emitted from said remote control are transmitted
      at a second frequency of the dual frequencies.\u201D  However, McCabe in combination
      with Kagaya teaches this limitation [at least see McCabe Figs. 3, 4; paras.
      0023, 0025, 0028, 0029 which teaches a wireless control system for a pallet
      truck which includes a processor which turns the input signal into a digital
      signal applies an encryption code to said digital signal and transmits the encrypted
      signal to the receiver on the pallet truck and a receiver on the pallet truck
      which demodulates the signal and compares it to the encryption code that is
      stored in memory if the encryption code is correct, the signal is passed to
      the controller on the pallet truck and as discussed above Kagaya Abstract; para.
      0020 teaches a remote control system that has a dual tone multi-frequency signal
      generating unit and a retransmission unit].\\nAccordingly, it would be obvious
      to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to
      modify the teaching of Finkle to include the signal encryption as taught by
      McCabe in order to distinguish the control signals from multiple operators when
      multiple vehicles are being operated in the same vicinity (McCabe 0028) and
      it would be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time
      of the invention to modify the teaching of Finkle to use multiple frequencies
      as taught by Kagaya because in radio controlled transmissions, simultaneous
      transmissions from a common base through the same frequency is difficult when
      there is a possibility of interference among other signals. (Kagaya 0008).\\nFinkle
      also does not disclose at least three touch switches disposed on said remote
      control respectively controlling an accelerating cruise, a decelerating cruise,
      and a brake of said brushless motor.  However, McDonough teaches this limitation
      [at least see McDonough Fig. 3 at (126), (132), (133), Fig 4 at (144), (146),
      (147), (148); which teaches a remote control for controlling the motor of a
      ceiling fan including a fan motor on/off button (144) and air flow  reverse
      button (148) (brake), fast button (146) (accelerating cruise), and slow button
      (147) (decelerating cruise)].  Accordingly, it would be obvious to a person
      having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to modify the
      teaching of Finkle to include a user interface as taught by McDonough because
      of the need to efficiently transmit user commands to control the motor.\\nRegarding
      Claim 2 (amended), Finkle discloses wherein, in said remote driving device,
      at least one active wheel is connected to a synchronizing wheel on said brushless
      motor via a synchronizing tape [at least see Finkle Figs. 2-9 teaching an electric
      motor for a skateboard driving a wheel of the skate board using a toothed belt].\\nRegarding
      Claim 6, Finkle does not teach said remote control comprises a further touch
      switch which serves to control a reversing of said brushless motor.  However,
      McDonough teaches this limitations [at least see McDonough Fig 4 at (148); which
      teaches a remote control for controlling the motor of a ceiling fan a ceiling
      fan including a fan motor reverse button (at (148)]. \\nAccordingly, it would
      be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention
      to modify the teaching of Finkle to include a reverse tough switch as taught
      by McDonough because of the need to efficiently transmit user commands to the
      motor.\\nRegarding Claim 8, Finkle discloses wherein, said remote control adopts
      a potential sliding stem to emit said control signals to said controller; said
      potential sliding stem includes a sliding buckle whose displacement amount decides
      a self-velocity of said skateboard, whereby said skateboard attains an average
      velocity while said sliding buckle is clutched backward and a deceleration effect
      while said sliding buckle is moved forward to its original position; said sliding
      buckle moved frontward over a certain limited angle serves to trigger a brake
      motion. [at least see Finkle Figs. 1, 11, column 4, lines 25-46].\\nnumber='10'Regarding
      Claim 14, Finkle discloses wherein, a battery box is disposed on said lower
      surface of said skateboard; said battery box includes a bottom surface and two
      side surfaces; a first groove is defined on the bottom of said battery box for
      intercommunicating and fitting with a second groove defined on said skateboard
      while installing said battery box; a power socket defined on said battery box
      connects to said controller and tightly engages with a plug on said controller
      [at least see Finkle Figs. 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15; column 3, lines 21-54 which
      teaches an electric powered skateboard with 2 batteries held in a battery box
      mounted to the bottom of the skateboard which includes a polymeric block on
      two sides and two groves in each block for connecting the batteries (at (29),
      (36) and column 3, lines 43-54) (a battery box is disposed on said lower surface
      of said skateboard; said battery box includes a bottom surface and two side
      surfaces; a first groove is defined on the bottom of said battery box for intercommunicating
      and fitting with a second groove defined on said skateboard while installing
      said battery box) and teaches a motor control unit mounted to the bottom of
      the skateboard for controlling the speed of the skateboard (Fig,4 at (30) (a
      power socket defined on said battery box connects to said controller and tightly
      engages with a plug on said controller) ]. \\nRegarding Claim 15, Finkle discloses
      wherein, a secure lock is disposed inside said battery box [at least see Finkle
      Fig. 4 at (38), column 3, lines 51-54) which teaches a pair of spring loaded
      retainers to hold the batteries in place.  \\nRegarding Claim 16, Finkle does
      not explicitly disclose wherein, at least one set of Li-ion battery is included
      in the battery box.  However, it would have been obvious to one having ordinary
      skill in the art at the time of the invention was made to use a li-ion battery
      to power the electric skateboard since this is a substitution of known equivalents
      and involves only routine skill in the art. In re Scott, 139 USPQ 297. \\nnumber='11'Regarding
      Claim 17, Finkle discloses wherein, said Li-ion battery adopts the voltage of
      12V to 36V [at least see Finkle column 3, lines 21-39 which teaches using two
      12 volt batteries as a power source for an electric skateboard]. \\n Claim 7
      and 13 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Finkle
      in view of Kagaya, in view of Gass, in view of McCabe and in further view of
      McDonough or Phillips et al. US 2008/0086241 A1.\\nRegarding Claim 7, Finkle
      does not disclose said four touch switches on said remote control are an accelerating
      cruise button, a decelerating button, a reverse button, and a brake button,
      respectively.  However, McDonough or Phillips teaches this limitation [at least
      see McDonough Fig. 3 at (126), (132), (133), Fig 4 at (144), (146), (147), (148);
      which teaches a remote control for controlling the motor of a ceiling fan including
      a fan motor on/off button (144) and air flow reverse button (148) (brake), fast
      button (146) (accelerating cruise), and slow button (147) (decelerating cruise)
      or Phillips Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4; para. 0076, 0080 which teaches a controller for
      a robot where the left joystick controls the drive movement of the robot (forward,
      backward, left, right; a right button array) where one of the buttons controls
      the vehicle\u2019s speed (accelerating cruise, decelerating cruise, reverse);
      and an upper left button which is a pause or brake button (brake) for the robot].\\nAccordingly,
      it would be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time
      of the invention to modify the teaching of Finkle to include a user interface
      as taught by McDonough or Phillips because of the need to efficiently transmit
      user commands to the controller.\\nRegarding Claim 13, Finkle does not teach
      wherein, said controller would automatically emit a stop signal to stop said
      skateboard when said controller beyond a remote-control distance fails to receive
      said signals from said remote control; said effective remote-control number='12'distance
      between said remote control and said controller is within 3 meters. However,
      Phillips teaches this limitation [at least see Phillips para. 0203 which teaches
      powering down the robot when communication is lost with the control system].\\nAccordingly
      it would be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time
      of the invention to modify the teaching of Finkle to program the controller
      to stop the robot as taught by Phillips when the vehicle controller is no longer
      in communication with the remote control because of the need for the controller
      to perform an autonomous task when not in communication with the remote ((Phillips
      paras. 0004, 0005, 0243).\\n Claim 9 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being
      unpatentable over Finkle in view of Kagaya, in view of Gass, in view of McCabe,
      in view of McDonough and in further view of Hillman et al. US 2006/0032682.
      \ \\nRegarding Claim 9, Finkle does not teach wherein, a back switch is disposed
      on a top portion of said remote control.  However, this limitation is taught
      by Hillman combined with McDonough [at least see Hillman Fig. 9, 10, 11, para
      0057, 0058 which teaches a handheld remote for controlling a motorized skateboard
      with a brake button on the top of the controller to be operated by the user\u2019s
      thumb (disposed on a top portion of said remote control) and McDonough which
      teaches a remote control for controlling the motor of a ceiling fan which includes
      an air flow reverse button (148) (back switch)].  \\nAccordingly, it would be

      Claim 18 (amended), Finkle discloses a remote control electric powered skateboard
      having a board with an upper rider-support surface and a lower surface supporting
      a plurality of wheels, and further comprising: a remote control [at least see
      Finkle fig 1 (char 12); fig 11]; a controller, wherein the remote control communicates
      with the controller \u2026 a receiver [at least see Finkle fig 10 which discloses
      a transmitter (char 54) a receiver (char 45) and a speed control (char 48) connected
      to a motor (char 22)]; a [electric] motor installed on said lower surface of
      said skateboard connected to a battery device that provides said [electric]
      motor with a driving power through the controller [at least see number='14'Finkle
      Abstract; Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; and to at least one of said wheels [at least
      see Finkle Figs. 2, 3 at (20), (21) (22), (23), (24), (25), (26)]; said [electric]
      motor controlled by the remote control and the controller [at least see Finkle
      Abstract; Fig 1 at (12), Figs. 10, 11]; \u2026 thereby allowing various actions
      pursuant to said signals emitted from said remote control to be implemented
      by said skateboard [at least see Finkle Abstract; column 1, lines 55-67], ...
      said [electric] motor utilizing an instant obverse-reverse rotation characteristic
      to trigger said brake; while a braking signal being emitted from said remote
      control, said controller would thence emit a counter current to said [electric]
      motor, so that said [electric] motor having a braking function equivalent to
      a reverse rotation [at least see Finkle Abstract; column 1, lines 55-67, column
      3, lines 48], but does not disclose communication via dual frequencies.  However,
      Kagaya teaches this limitation [at least see Kagaya Abstract; para. 0020 which
      teaches a remote control system that has a dual tone multi-frequency signal
      generating unit and a retransmission unit which reads on said remote control
      communicates with said controller through dual frequencies].\\nAccordingly,
      it would be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time
      of the invention to modify the teaching of Finkle to use multiple frequencies
      as taught by Kagaya because in radio controlled transmissions, simultaneous
      transmissions from a common base through the same frequency is difficult when
      there is a possibility of interference among other signals. (Kagaya 0008).\\nFinkle
      does not explicitly disclose a brushless hub motor. However, Crigler teaches
      this limitation [at least see Crigler Fig. 9; paras. 0063, 0064 which teaches
      a brushless hub motor for a motorized skateboard].\\nAccordingly, it would be
      obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention
      to modify the teaching of Finkle to include a brushless hub motor as taught
      by number='15'Crigler because brushless motors are more reliable, require less
      maintenance, increased efficiency, and allow for electric reversing (Gass 0064)
      and hub motors have fewer moving parts.\\nFinkle does not disclose wherein the
      controller provides an automatic comparison function; when said remote control
      is subjected to electrification allowing an automatic generation of an initial
      code for permitting the controller to execute a spontaneous identification and
      automatically un-lock said initial code; wherein an automatic decoding is carried
      on after said remote control is shut off; said receiver receiving control signals
      emitted from said remote control, said controller thence decoding said signals
      so as to dispatch distinct commands to said brushless motor.  However, McCabe
      reads on this limitation [at least see McCabe Figs. 3, 4; paras. 0023, 0025,
      0028, 0029 which teaches a wireless control system for a pallet truck which
      includes a processor which turns the input signal into a digital signal applies
      an encryption code to said digital signal and transmits the encrypted signal
      to the receiver on the pallet truck, the receive on the pallet truck which demodulates
      the signal and compares it to the encryption code that is stored in memory if
      the encryption code is correct, the signal is passed to the controller on the
      pallet truck].  \\nAccordingly, it would be obvious to a person having ordinary
      skill in the art at the time of the invention to modify the teaching of Finkle
      to add the signal encryption as taught by McCabe in order to distinguish the
      signals from multiple operators when multiple vehicles are being operated in
      the same vicinity (McCabe 0028).\\nFinkle does not disclose wherein the remote
      control automatically generates the initial code for permitting the controller
      to execute the spontaneous identification and automatically un-lock said initial
      code and to automatically decode and relock the initial code when the remote
      control is shut off or beyond a detection distance from the receiver at a first
      frequency of the number='16'dual frequencies and wherein the control signals
      emitted from said remote control are transmitted at a second frequency of the
      dual frequencies.\u201D  However, McCabe in combination with Kagaya teaches
      this limitation [at least see McCabe Figs. 3, 4; paras. 0023, 0025, 0028, 0029

      processor which turns the input signal into a digital signal applies an encryption
      code to said digital signal and transmits the encrypted signal to the receiver
      on the pallet truck and a receiver on the pallet truck which demodulates the
      signal and compares it to the encryption code that is stored in memory if the
      encryption code is correct, the signal is passed to the controller on the pallet
      truck and as discussed above Kagaya Abstract; para. 0020 teaches a remote control
      system that has a dual tone multi-frequency signal generating unit and a retransmission
      unit].\\nAccordingly, it would be obvious to a person having ordinary skill
      in the art at the time of the invention to modify the teaching of Finkle to
      include the signal encryption as taught by McCabe in order to distinguish the
      control signals from multiple operators when multiple vehicles are being operated
      in the same vicinity (McCabe 0028) and it would be obvious to a person having
      ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to modify the teaching
      of Finkle to use multiple frequencies as taught by Kagaya because in radio controlled
      transmissions, simultaneous transmissions from a common base through the same
      frequency is difficult when there is a possibility of interference among other
      signals. (Kagaya 0008).\\nFinkle also does not teach at least three touch switches
      disposed on said remote control respectively controlling an accelerating cruise,
      a decelerating cruise, and a brake of said brushless motor.  However, McDonough
      teaches this limitation [at least see McDonough Fig. 3 at (126), (132), (133),
      Fig 4 at (144), (146), (147), (148); which teaches a remote control for controlling

      flow number='17'reverse button (148) (brake), fast button (146) (accelerating
      cruise), and slow button (147) (decelerating cruise)].\\nAccordingly, it would
      be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention
      to modify the teaching of Finkle to add the user interface as taught by McDonough
      because of the need to efficiently transmit user commands from the interface
      to the motor.\\nRegarding Claim 23 (amended), Finkle does not disclose said
      remote control comprises a further touch switch which serves to control a reversing
      of said brushless However, McDonough teaches this limitations [at least see
      McDonough Fig 4 at (148); which teaches a remote control for controlling the
      motor of a ceiling fan a ceiling fan including a fan motor reverse button (148)].
      \\nAccordingly, it would be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the
      art at the time of the invention to modify the teaching of Finkle to include
      a reverse tough switch as taught by McDonough because of the need to efficiently
      transmit user commands to the motor.\\nRegarding Claim 25, Finkle discloses
      wherein, said remote control adopts a potential sliding stem to emit said control
      signals to said controller; said potential sliding stem includes a sliding buckle
      whose displacement amount decides a self-velocity of said skateboard displacing
      amount, whereby said skateboard attains an average velocity while said sliding
      buckle is clutched backward and a deceleration effect while said sliding buckle
      is moved forward to its original position; said sliding buckle moved frontward
      over a certain limited angle serves to trigger a brake motion. [at least see
      Finkle Figs. 1, 11, column 4, lines 25-46].\\nRegarding Claim 31, Finkle discloses
      wherein, a battery box is disposed on said lower surface of said skateboard;
      said battery box includes a bottom surface and two side surfaces; a first groove
      is defined on the bottom of said battery box for intercommunicating and fitting
      with a second groove defined on said skateboard while installing said battery
      box; a power socket number='18'defined on said battery box connects to said
      controller and tightly engages with a plug on said controller [at least see
      Finkle Figs. 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15; column 3, lines 2154 which teaches an electric
      powered skateboard with 2 batteries held in a battery box mounted to the bottom
      of the skateboard which includes a polymeric block on two sides and two groves
      in each block for connecting the batteries (at (29), (36) and column 3, lines
      43-54) (a battery box is disposed on said lower surface of said skateboard,

      is defined on the bottom of said battery box for intercommunicating and fitting
      with a second groove defined on said skateboard while installing said battery

      for controlling the speed of the skateboard (Fig,4 at (30)) (a power socket
      defined on said battery box connects to said controller and tightly engages
      with a plug on said controller)]. \\nRegarding Claim 32, Finkle discloses wherein,
      a secure lock is disposed inside said battery box [at least see Finkle Fig.
      4 at (38), column 3, lines 51-54) which teaches a pair of spring loaded retainers
      to hold the batteries in place].  \\nRegarding Claim 33, Finkle discloses does
      not explicitly teach wherein, at least one set of Li-ion battery is included
      in the battery box.  However, it would have been obvious to one having ordinary
      skill in the art at the time of the invention was made to use a li-ion battery
      to power the electric skateboard since this is a substitution of known equivalents
      and involves only routine skill in the art. In re Scott, 139 USPQ 297. \\nRegarding
      Claim 34, Finkle discloses wherein, said Li-ion battery adopts the voltage of
      12V to 36V [at least see Finkle column 3, lines 21-39 which teaches using two
      12 volt batteries as a power source for an electric skateboard]. number='19'\\n
      Claim 24 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Finkle
      in view of Kagaya, in view of Crigler, in view of McCabe and in further view
      of McDonough or Phillips.\\nRegarding Claim 24, Finkle does not teach said four
      touch switches on said remote control are an accelerating cruise button, a decelerating
      button, a reverse button, and a brake button, respectively.  However, McDonough
      or Phillips teaches this limitation [at least see McDonough Fig. 3 at (126),
      (132), (133), Fig 4 at (144), (146), (147), (148); which teaches a remote control
      for controlling the motor of a ceiling fan including a fan motor on/off button
      (144) and air flow reverse button (148) (brake), fast button (146) (accelerating
      cruise), and slow button (147) (decelerating cruise) or Phillips Figs. 1, 2,
      3, 4; para. 0076, 0080 which teaches a controller for a robot where the left
      joystick controls the drive movement of the robot (forward, backward, left,
      right; a right button array where one of the buttons controls the vehicle\u2019s
      speed (accelerating cruise, decelerating cruise); and an upper left button which
      is a pause or brake button (brake) for the robot].\\nAccordingly, it would be
      obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention
      to modify the teaching of Finkle to include a user interface as taught by McDonough
      or Phillips because of the need to efficiently transmit user commands to the
      controller.\\n Claim 26 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable
      over Finkle in view of Kagaya, in view of Crigler, in view of McCabe, in view
      of McDonough and in further view of Hillman.  \\nRegarding Claim 26, Finkle
      does not teach wherein, a back switch is disposed on a top portion of said remote
      control.  However, this limitation is taught by Hillman combined with McDonough
      [at least see Hillman Fig. 9, 10, 11, para 0057, 0058 which teaches a handheld
      number='20'remote for controlling a motorized skateboard with a brake button
      on the top of the controller to be operated by the user\u2019s thumb (disposed
      on a top portion of said remote control) and McDonough which teaches a remote
      control for controlling the motor of a ceiling fan which includes an air flow
      reverse button (148) (back switch)].  \\nAccordingly, it would be obvious to
      a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to modify
      the teaching of Finkle to include a button on top of the remote as taught by
      Hillman and to connect the button to a reverse mode for the motor as taught
      by McDonough because of the need for a user interface to efficiently transmit
      user commands to the motor.\\n Claims 27 and 28 are rejected under 35 U.S.C.

      Claim 27 (amended), Finkle does not teach wherein, said brushless hub motor
      adopts a high speed permanent magnet synchronous motor whose highest rotational
      speed is 950 to 5100 RPM.  However, Erdman teaches this limitation [at least
      see Erdman Figs. 11, 12].\\nRegarding Claim 28, Finkle does not teach wherein,
      said high speed permanent magnet synchronous motor possesses at least 75% to
      95% horsepower energy and 12V to 36V voltage. However, Erdman teaches this limitation
      [at least see Erdman Figs. 11, 12].\\nAccordingly, it would be obvious to a
      person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to modify
      the teaching of Finkle to select an efficient brushless motor based on the speed

      would automatically emit a stop signal to stop said skateboard when said controller
      beyond a remote-control distance fails to receive said signals from said remote
      control; said effective remote-control distance between said remote control
      and said controller is within 3 meters. However, Phillips teaches this limitation
      [at least see Phillips para. 0203 which teaches powering down the robot when
      communication is lost with the control system].\\nAccordingly it would be obvious
      to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to
      modify the teaching of Finkle to program the controller to stop the robot as
      taught by Phillips when the vehicle controller is no longer in communication
      with the remote control because of the need for the controller to perform an
      autonomous task to ensure safety of the vehicle and bystanders when not in communication
      with the remote (Phillips paras. 0004, 0005, 0243).\\n Claims 35, 37, 44, 47,

      combined with Crigler teaches this limitation [at least see Gass para. 0064,
      0078, 0086 which teaches a brushless motor and Crigler Fig. 9; paras. 0063,
      0064 which teaches a brushless hub motor for a motorized skateboard]. \\nAccordingly,
      it would be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time
      of the invention to modify the teaching of Finkle to include a brushless motor
      taught by Gass or the brushless hub motor as taught by Crigler because brushless
      motors are more reliable, require less maintenance, increased efficiency, and
      allow for electric reversing (Gass 0064) and hub motors have fewer moving parts
      (Crigler, Fig. 9).\\nFinkle also does not disclose a remote control wherein
      the controller provides an automatic comparison function; when said remote control
      is subjected to electrification allowing an automatic generation of an initial
      code for permitting the controller to execute a spontaneous identification and
      automatically un-lock said initial code; wherein an automatic decoding is carried
      on after said remote control is shut off; said receiver receiving control signals
      emitted from said remote handle or the remote control, said controller thence
      decoding said signals so number='26'as to dispatch distinct commands to said
      brushless motor or hub motor, thereby allowing various actions pursuant to said
      signals emitted from said remote handle or remote control to be implemented.
      \ However, McCabe reads on this limitation [at least see McCabe Figs. 3, 4;
      paras. 0023, 0025, 0028, 0029 which teaches a wireless control system for a
      pallet truck which includes a processor which turns the input signal into a
      digital signal applies an encryption code to said digital signal and transmits
      the encrypted signal to the receiver on the pallet truck, the receive on the
      pallet truck which demodulates the signal and compares it to the encryption
      code that is stored in memory if the encryption code is correct, the signal
      is passed to the controller on the pallet truck].  \\nAccordingly, it would
      be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention
      to modify the teaching of Finkle to add the signal encryption as taught by McCabe
      in order to distinguish the signals from multiple operators when multiple vehicles
      are being operated in the same vicinity (McCabe 0028).\\nFinkle does not disclose
      wherein the remote control automatically generates the initial code for permitting
      the controller to execute the spontaneous identification and automatically un-lock
      said initial code and to automatically decode and relock the initial code when
      the remote control is shut off or beyond a detection distance from the receiver
      at a first frequency of the dual frequencies and wherein the control signals
      emitted from said remote control are transmitted at a second frequency of the
      dual frequencies.\\nHowever, McCabe in combination with Kagaya teaches this
      limitation [at least see McCabe Figs. 3, 4; paras. 0023, 0025, 0028, 0029 which
      teaches a wireless control system for a pallet truck which includes a processor
      which turns the input signal into a digital signal applies an encryption code
      to said digital signal and transmits the encrypted signal to the receiver on
      the pallet truck and a receiver on the pallet truck which demodulates the signal
      and compares it number='27'to the encryption code that is stored in memory if
      the encryption code is correct, the signal is passed to the controller on the
      pallet truck and as discussed above Kagaya Abstract; para. 0020 teaches a remote
      control system that has a dual tone multi-frequency signal generating unit and
      a retransmission unit].\\nAccordingly, it would be obvious to a person having
      ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to modify the teaching
      of Finkle to include the signal encryption as taught by McCabe in order to distinguish
      the control signals from multiple operators when multiple vehicles are being
      operated in the same vicinity (McCabe 0028) and it would be obvious to a person
      having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to modify the
      teaching of Finkle to use multiple frequencies as taught by Kagaya because in
      radio controlled transmissions, simultaneous transmissions from a common base
      through the same frequency is difficult when there is a possibility of interference
      among other signals. (Kagaya 0008).\\nFinkle also does not teach at least three
      touch switches disposed on each of said remote control and the remote handle
      respectively and controlling an accelerating cruise, a decelerating cruise,
      and a brake of said brushless motor or said brushless hub motor.  However, McDonough
      teaches this limitation [at least see McDonough Fig. 3 at (126), (132), (133),
      Fig 4 at (144), (146), (147), (148); which teaches a remote control for controlling
      the motor of a ceiling fan including a fan motor on/off button (144) and air
      flow reverse button (148) (brake), fast button (146) (accelerating cruise),
      and slow button (147) (decelerating cruise)].\\nAccordingly, it would be obvious
      to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to
      modify the teaching of Finkle to add one or more user interfaces between the
      user and the motorized device as taught by McDonough because of the need to
      efficiently transmit user commands from the interface to the motor.\\nnumber='28'Regarding
      Claim 37, Finkle discloses wherein, said remote  [electric] motor or said [electric]
      motor, but does not explicitly teach a handle or brushless motor or brushless
      hub motor. However, McLeese teaches a handle bar for an electric powered skateboard
      [at least see McLeese Fig. 8 at (10), (12), (80), (92); para. 0040], Gass teaches
      a brushless motor [at least see Gass para. 0064, 0078, 0086] and Crigler teaches
      use of a brushless hub motor [at least see Crigler Fig. 9; paras. 0063, 0064].
      \ \\nAccordingly, it would be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the
      art at the time of the invention to modify the teaching of Finkle to include
      a handle taught by McLeese in order to provide a handle as an accessory for
      the rider\u2019s convenience (McLeese para. 0021, 0040) and the brushless motor
      taught by Gass and the brushless hub motor taught by Crigler because brushless
      motors are more reliable, require less maintenance, increased efficiency, and
      allow for electric reversing (Gass 0064) and hub motors have fewer moving parts.\\n
      \ Regarding Claim 43 (amended), Finkle discloses a sliding buckle for controlling
      the speed of a motorized skateboard (wherein, ), but does not teaches does not
      teach said reverse button.  However, McDonough teaches this limitations [at
      least see McDonough Fig 4 at (148); which teaches a remote control for controlling
      the motor of a ceiling fan a ceiling fan including a fan motor reverse button
      (at (148)]. \\nAccordingly, it would be obvious to a person having ordinary
      skill in the art at the time of the invention to modify the teaching of Finkle
      to include a reverse button as taught by McDonough because of the need to efficiently
      transmit user commands to the motor and the benefit to the user of the option
      to reverse the direction of a skateboard.\\nnumber='29'Regarding Claim 44, Finkle
      does not teach wherein, said brushless motor and said brushless hub motor adopt
      a high speed permanent magnet synchronous motor.  However, Gass and Crigler
      teach this limitation.  Gass teaches a permanent magnet brushless motor [at
      least see Gass para. 0064, 0078, 0086 (brushless motor \u2026 adopt(s) a high
      speed permanent magnet synchronous motor] and Crigler teaches use of a permanent
      magnet brushless hub motor [at least see Crigler Fig. 9; paras. 0063, 0064 which
      teaches a brushless hub motor with a plurality of magnets fixed to the inner
      diameter of the hub wheel casing for a motorized skateboard (brushless hub motor
      adopt a high speed permanent magnet synchronous motor)].\\nAccordingly, it would
      be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention
      to modify the teaching of Finkle to include a permanent magnet brushless motor
      taught by Gass or the permanent magnet brushless hub motor as taught by Crigler
      because brushless motors are more reliable, require less maintenance, increased
      efficiency, and allow for electric reversing (Gass 0064) and hub motors have
      fewer moving parts.\\nRegarding Claim 47, Finkle discloses wherein, a battery
      box is disposed on said lower surface of said skateboard; said battery box includes
      a bottom surface and two side surfaces; a first groove is defined on the bottom
      of said battery box for intercommunicating and fitting with a second groove
      defined on said skateboard while installing said battery box; a power socket
      defined on said battery box connects to said controller and tightly engages
      with a plug on said controller [at least see Finkle Figs. 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12,
      15; column 3, lines 21-54 which teaches an electric powered skateboard with
      2 batteries held in a battery box mounted to the bottom of the skateboard which
      includes a polymeric block on two sides and two groves in each block for connecting
      the batteries (at (29), (36) and column 3, lines 43-54) (a battery box is disposed
      on said lower surface of said skateboard; said battery box includes a bottom
      surface and two side surfaces; a first groove is defined on the bottom of said
      battery box for intercommunicating and number='30'fitting with a second groove
      defined on said skateboard while installing said battery box) and teaches a
      motor control unit mounted to the bottom of the skateboard for controlling the
      speed of the skateboard (Fig,4 at (30) (a power socket defined on said battery
      box connects to said controller and tightly engages with a plug on said controller)
      ]. \\nRegarding Claim 48, Finkle t discloses wherein, a secure lock is disposed
      inside said battery box [at least see Finkle Fig. 4 at (38), column 3, lines
      51-54) which teaches a pair of spring loaded retainers to hold the batteries
      in place.  \\nRegarding Claim 49, Finkle discloses does not explicitly teach
      wherein, at least one set of Li-ion battery is included in the battery box.
      \ However, it would have been obvious to one having ordinary skill in the art
      at the time of the invention was made to use a li-ion battery to power the electric
      skateboard since this is a substitution of known equivalents and involves only
      routine skill in the art. In re Scott, 139 USPQ 297. \\nRegarding Claim 50,
      Finkle discloses wherein, said Li-ion battery adopts the voltage of 12V to 36V
      [at least see Finkle column 3, lines 21-39 which teaches using two 12 volt batteries
      as a power source for an electric skateboard]. \\n Claim 36 is rejected under
      35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable under Finkle in view of Kagaya, in view
      of Gass, in view of Crigler, in view of McCabe, in view of McDonough, in view
      of McLeese, in view of Heringer, in further view of Chen and in further view
      of Pouchkarev US 6,439,940 B1.\\nRegarding Claim 36, Finkle does not disclose
      wherein, a cover covers said through hole and said opening after removing said
      auxiliary remote device, which permits said electric powered skateboard to be
      operated by said remote control, thence achieving an all-purpose effect.  However,
      Pouchkarev teaches this limitation [at least see Pouchkarev Fig. 5, column 4,
      lines 23-32 which teaches a removable sealing plug for a fin and watercraft
      system].\\nnumber='31'   \\tAccordingly, it would be obvious to a person having
      ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to modify the teaching
      of Finkle to include a plug to fit in the opening as taught by Pouchkarev to
      seal the opening and protect the rider (Pouchkarev column 4, lines 30-32).\\n
      Claim 46 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable under Finkle
      in view of Kagaya, in view of Gass, in view of Crigler, in view of McCabe, in
      view of McDonough, in view of McLeese, in view of Heringer, in view of Chen
      and in further view of Phillips.\\nRegarding Claim 46, Finkle does not teach
      wherein, said controller would automatically emit a stop signal to stop said
      skateboard when said controller beyond a remote-control distance fails to receive
      said signals from said remote control; said effective remote-control distance
      between said remote control and said controller is within 3 meters. However,
      Phillips teaches this limitation [at least see Phillips para. 0203 which teaches
      powering down the robot when communication is lost with the control system].\\nAccordingly
      it would be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time
      of the invention to modify the teaching of Finkle to program the controller
      to stop the robot as taught by Phillips when the vehicle controller is no longer
      in communication with the remote control because of the need for the controller
      to perform an autonomous task when not in communication with the remote in order
      to protect the vehicle and bystanders (Phillips paras. 0004, 0005, 0243).\\n\"],\n

      subject matter which was not described in the specification in such a way as
      to reasonably convey to one skilled in the relevant art that the inventors,
      at the time the application was filed, had possession of the claimed invention.
      \ The subject claims were amended by the Applicants following the prior office
      action.  \\nRegarding the word un-locked said initial code, in line 17 of amended
      Claim 1, Applicants added \u201Cun-\u201D before the word \u201Clock\u201D and
      in line 25 of amended Claim 1, Applicants added the phrase \u201Cautomatically
      un-lock said initial code\u201D (Applicants similarly amended Claims 18 and
      35).  These amendments modify the scope of the claims because to \\\"automatically
      un-lock said initial code\\\" is the exact opposite function of \u201Cautomatically
      lock said initial code\\\" and the change the word \u201Clock\u201D to \u201Cun-lock\u201D
      is not supported by the application as filed.  See Abstract; (the electrification
      of the remote control executes, the remote control spontaneously  generates
      an initial code for a receiver in the controller to robotically distinguish
      and lock the code); para 0006 (the remote control subjected to electrification
      allows an automatic generation of an initial code for permitting a receiver
      in the controller to execute the spontaneous identification and automatically
      lock the initial code); para 0033, 0036 (the remote control 1 would automatically
      emit an initial code for the receiver in the controller 17 to spontaneously
      distinguish and lock the initial code).  \\nRegarding decode when beyond a detection
      distance, the Applicants\u2019 amendments to Claims 1, 18, and 35 added the
      limitation \u201Cwherein the remote control automatically generates the initial
      code for permitting the controller to execute the spontaneous identification
      and automatically un-lock said initial code and to automatically decode and
      relock the initial code when the remote control is shut off or beyond a detection
      distance from the receiver at a first frequency of the dual frequencies and
      wherein the control signals emitted from said remote control are transmitted
      at a second frequency of the dual frequencies.\u201D  Although the limitation
      \u201Cautomatically decode \u2026 the initial code when the remote control is
      shut off\u201D is supported by the initial application, the written description
      does not support the limitation \\\"automatically decode \u2026 the initial
      code when \u2026  beyond a detectable distance from the receiver.\u201D  There
      is nothing in the original disclose to support this limitation.  The only reference
      in the initial disclosure regarding a particular action when the remote control
      is beyond the distance of the receiver is for the controller to emit a stop
      signal (para 0008; Claims 13, 30, 46).  This original disclosure does not support
      the limitation \\\"automatically decode \u2026 the initial code when \u2026
      \ beyond a detectable distance from the receiver\u201D  which was added by the
      amendments to Claims 1, 18, and 35.  \\nRegarding relock when shut off when
      beyond a detection distance, the written description does not support the limitation
      \u201Crelock the initial code when the remote control is  shut off or beyond
      a detection distance from the receiver.\u201D Particularly, there is no mention
      in the specification of relocking the initial code.  The only references in
      the original disclose to the initial code include: Abstract (spontaneously generating
      an initial code); para 0006 (automatic generation of an initial code \u2026
      automatically lock the initial code); para 0007 (remote control emits an initial
      code for the controller to receive and lockout); para 0033, 0036 (the remote
      control 1 would automatically emit an initial code for the receiver in the controller
      17 to spontaneously distinguish and lock the initial code).  This original disclosure
      does not support the limitation \\\"relock the initial code when the remote
      control is shut off or beyond a detection distance from the receiver\\\" which
      was added by the amendments to Claims 1, 18, and 35.    \\nRegarding at a first
      frequency of the dual frequencies, the specification does support the limitation
      \u201Cwherein the control signals emitted from said remote control are transmitted
      at a second frequency of the dual frequencies\u201D which was added to Claims
      1, 18, and 35 via amendments.  However, the limitation \u201Cat a first frequency
      of the dual frequencies\u201D is not supported by the original disclosure.  It
      is understood by the Examiner that this limitation means that the automatic
      decoding and relocking of the initial code is completed using the first frequency.
      \ Although the original disclosure includes using dual frequencies for communication
      between the remote controller and the controller (para 0009, 0036; Claims 5,
      22, 40), the only reference to distinguishing the use of the two frequencies
      is found in para 0036 which states \u201C[f]or example, the 2.4G WIFI high frequency
      is applied for communication and range finding, and the low frequency is applied
      for controlling the motor and the controller 17.  Thus, the two-way encoding
      of the dual communication is beneficial for ensuring the one-to-one communication,
      so that the remote control and the controller would not be interfered by external
      magnetic field or other radio wave.\u201D  This paragraph is too broad to support
      the limitation  regarding using the first frequency of the dual frequencies
      for automatically decoding and relocking the initial code.\u201D\\nRegarding
      Claim 35 (amended) auxiliary remote device, lines 27 and 28 of Claim 35 (amended)
      add the limitation \u201Cwherein the auxiliary remote device is a component
      of the remote handle.\u201D This limitation is not supported by the original
      disclosure and is contrary to the original disclosure.  The Abstract describes
      the auxiliary remote device as follows: auxiliary remote device disposed on
      the joint between a front support and a plywood is foldable or could stand on
      the skateboard; the height of the auxiliary remote device is adjustable for
      meeting divergent demands from dissimilar riders.  A remote handle further provides
      the same operating means as that of the remote control for offering a supplementary
      supporting function.  Figures 11 (char 9) shows and paragraph 0037 states: auxiliary
      remote device 9 is disposed on the joint between passive wheel 21 and the plywood
      3).  Paragraph 0038 states and Figures 11 through 13 (char 9, 921) show that
      the remote handle is a component of the auxiliary remote device not visa-a-versa.
      \ \\n For the preceding reasons, Claims 1, 18, and 35 are rejected under 35
      U.S.C. \xA7 112, first paragraph because they fail to comply with the written
      description requirement.\\nThe following is a quotation of the second paragraph
      of 35 U.S.C. \xA7 112:\\n Claim 35 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. \xA7 112, second
      paragraph, as being indefinite for failing to particularly point out and distinctly
      claim the subject matter which applicant regards as the invention.\\n Regarding
      Claim 35, lines 30 and 31 of Claim 35 recites the limitation \u201Ca brushless
      motor or brushless hub motor installed on a lower surface of said skateboard\u201D
      which the Examiner considers to be the antecedent.  However, the further limitations
      in Claim 35 that refer back to  the brushless motor or brushless hub motor do
      not refer to the motors using the same terminology.  For example lines 31 and
      32 when referring to the motors deletes the word \u201Cbrushless.\u201D  Similarly,
      line 35 when referring to the motors also deletes the word \u201Cbrushless.\u201D
      \ Line 44 maintains the word brushless before the word \u201Cmotor,\u201D but
      deletes it before the phrase \u201Chub motor.\u201D   Because of the inconsistent
      references to the brushless motor and brushless hub motor a person of ordinary
      skill in the art would not be reasonably apprised of the scope of the invention.
      \ Accordingly, Claim 35 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. \xA7 112, second paragraph

      in such a way as to reasonably convey to one skilled in the relevant art that
      the inventors, at the time the application was filed, had possession of the
      claimed invention.  The subject claims were amended by the Applicants following
      the prior office action.  \\nRegarding the word un-locked said initial code,

      code for permitting the controller to execute the spontaneous identification
      and automatically un-lock said initial code and to automatically decode and
      relock the initial code when the remote control is shut off or beyond a detection
      distance from the receiver at a first frequency of the dual frequencies and
      wherein the control signals emitted from said remote control are transmitted
      at a second frequency of the dual frequencies.\u201D  Although the limitation
      \u201Cautomatically decode \u2026 the initial code when the remote control is
      shut off\u201D is supported by the initial application, the written description
      does not support the limitation \\\"automatically decode \u2026 the initial
      code when \u2026  beyond a detectable distance from the receiver.\u201D  There
      is nothing in the original disclose to support this limitation.  The only reference
      in the initial disclosure regarding a particular action when the remote control
      is beyond the distance of the receiver is for the controller to emit a stop
      signal (para 0008; Claims 13, 30, 46).  This original disclosure does not support
      the limitation \\\"automatically decode \u2026 the initial code when \u2026
      \ beyond a detectable distance from the receiver\u201D  which was added by the
      amendments to Claims 1, 18, and 35.  \\nRegarding relock when shut off when
      beyond a detection distance, the written description does not support the limitation
      \u201Crelock the initial code when the remote control is  shut off or beyond
      a detection distance from the receiver.\u201D Particularly, there is no mention
      in the specification of relocking the initial code.  The only references in
      the original disclose to the initial code include: Abstract (spontaneously generating
      an initial code); para 0006 (automatic generation of an initial code \u2026
      automatically lock the initial code); para 0007 (remote control emits an initial
      code for the controller to receive and lockout); para 0033, 0036 (the remote
      control 1 would automatically emit an initial code for the receiver in the controller
      17 to spontaneously distinguish and lock the initial code).  This original disclosure
      does not support the limitation \\\"relock the initial code when the remote
      control is shut off or beyond a detection distance from the receiver\\\" which
      was added by the amendments to Claims 1, 18, and 35.    \\nRegarding at a first
      frequency of the dual frequencies, the specification does support the limitation
      \u201Cwherein the control signals emitted from said remote control are transmitted
      at a second frequency of the dual frequencies\u201D which was added to Claims
      1, 18, and 35 via amendments.  However, the limitation \u201Cat a first frequency
      of the dual frequencies\u201D is not supported by the original disclosure.  It
      is understood by the Examiner that this limitation means that the automatic
      decoding and relocking of the initial code is completed using the first frequency.
      \ Although the original disclosure includes using dual frequencies for communication
      between the remote controller and the controller (para 0009, 0036; Claims 5,
      22, 40), the only reference to distinguishing the use of the two frequencies
      is found in para 0036 which states \u201C[f]or example, the 2.4G WIFI high frequency
      is applied for communication and range finding, and the low frequency is applied
      for controlling the motor and the controller 17.  Thus, the two-way encoding
      of the dual communication is beneficial for ensuring the one-to-one communication,
      so that the remote control and the controller would not be interfered by external
      magnetic field or other radio wave.\u201D  This paragraph is too broad to support
      the limitation  regarding using the first frequency of the dual frequencies
      for automatically decoding and relocking the initial code.\u201D\\nRegarding
      Claim 35 (amended) auxiliary remote device, lines 27 and 28 of Claim 35 (amended)
      add the limitation \u201Cwherein the auxiliary remote device is a component
      of the remote handle.\u201D This limitation is not supported by the original
      disclosure and is contrary to the original disclosure.  The Abstract describes
      the auxiliary remote device as follows: auxiliary remote device disposed on
      the joint between a front support and a plywood is foldable or could stand on
      the skateboard; the height of the auxiliary remote device is adjustable for
      meeting divergent demands from dissimilar riders.  A remote handle further provides
      the same operating means as that of the remote control for offering a supplementary
      supporting function.  Figures 11 (char 9) shows and paragraph 0037 states: auxiliary
      remote device 9 is disposed on the joint between passive wheel 21 and the plywood
      3).  Paragraph 0038 states and Figures 11 through 13 (char 9, 921) show that
      the remote handle is a component of the auxiliary remote device not visa-a-versa.
      \ \\nFor the preceding reasons, Claims 1, 18, and 35 are rejected under 35 U.S.C.
      \xA7 112, first paragraph because they fail to comply with the written description
      requirement.\\nThe following is a quotation of the second paragraph of 35 U.S.C.
      \xA7 112:\\nThe specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly
      pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant
      regards as his invention. \\n\\nClaim 35 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. \xA7 112,
      second paragraph, as being indefinite for failing to particularly point out
      and distinctly claim the subject matter which applicant regards as the invention.\\nRegarding
      Claim 35, lines 30 and 31 of Claim 35 recites the limitation \u201Ca brushless
      motor or brushless hub motor installed on a lower surface of said skateboard\u201D
      which the Examiner considers to be the antecedent.  However, the further limitations
      in Claim 35 that refer back to  the brushless motor or brushless hub motor do
      not refer to the motors using the same terminology.  For example lines 31 and
      32 when referring to the motors deletes the word \u201Cbrushless.\u201D  Similarly,
      line 35 when referring to the motors also deletes the word \u201Cbrushless.\u201D
      \ Line 44 maintains the word brushless before the word \u201Cmotor,\u201D but
      deletes it before the phrase \u201Chub motor.\u201D   Because of the inconsistent
      references to the brushless motor and brushless hub motor a person of ordinary
      skill in the art would not be reasonably apprised of the scope of the invention.
      \ Accordingly, Claim 35 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. \xA7 112, second paragraph
      because it is indefinite. \\nClaim Rejections - 35 U.S.C. \xA7 103\\nThe following

      US 2009/0076664 A1 and in further view of McDonough et al. US 6,120,262.\\nRegarding
      Claim 1 (amended), Finkle discloses a remote control electric powered skateboard
      having a board with an upper rider-support surface and a lower surface supporting
      a plurality of wheels, and further comprising: a remote control [at least see
      Finkle fig 1 (char 12); fig 11]; a controller, wherein the remote control communicates
      with the controller \u2026 a receiver [at least see Finkle fig 10 which discloses
      a transmitter (char 54) a receiver (char 45) and a speed control (char 48) connected
      to a motor (char 22)]; a [electric] motor installed on  said lower surface of
      said skateboard connected to a battery device that provides said [electric]
      motor with a driving power through the controller [at least see Finkle Abstract;
      Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; a driving device disposed between said [electric] motor
      and at least one of said wheels [at least see Finkle Figs. 2, 3 at (20), (21)
      (22), (23), (24), (25), (26)]; said [electric] motor controlled by the remote
      control [at least see Finkle Abstract; Fig 1 at (12), Figs. 10, 11] \u2026 thereby
      allowing various actions pursuant to said signals emitted from said remote control
      to be implemented by said skateboard [at least see Finkle Abstract; column 1,
      lines 5567], ... said [electric] motor utilizing an instant obverse-reverse
      rotation characteristic to trigger said brake; while a braking signal being
      emitted from said remote control, said controller would thence emit a counter
      current to said [electric] [electric] [at least see Finkle Abstract; column
      1, lines 55-67, column 3, lines 48], but does not disclose communication via
      dual frequencies.  However, Kagaya teaches this limitation [at least see Kagaya
      Abstract; para. 0020 which teaches a remote control system that has a dual tone
      multifrequency signal generating unit and a retransmission unit which reads
      on said remote control communicates with said controller through dual frequencies.]\\nAccordingly,
      it would be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time
      of the invention to modify the teaching of Finkle to use multiple frequencies
      as taught by Kagaya because in radio controlled transmissions, simultaneous
      transmissions from a common base through the same frequency is difficult when
      there is a possibility of interference among other signals. (Kagaya 0008).\\nFinkle
      does not explicitly disclose a brushless motor.  However, Gass teaches use of
      a brushless motor [at least see Gass para. 0064, 0078, 0086 which teaches using
      a brushless motor for a battery operated power drill].  \\n Accordingly, it
      would be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of
      the invention to modify the teaching of Finkle to include a brushless motor
      as taught by Gass because brushless motors are more reliable, require less maintenance,
      increased efficiency, and electric reversing (Gass 0064).\\nFinkle does not
      disclose the controller provides an automatic comparison function; when said
      remote control subjected to electrification allowing an automatic generation
      of an initial code for permitting the controller to execute a spontaneous identification
      and automatically un-lock said initial code; wherein an automatic decoding being
      carried on after said remote control is shut off; said receiver receiving control
      signals emitted from said remote control, said controller thence decoding said
      signals so as to dispatch distinct commands to said brushless motor.  However,
      and McCabe reads of this limitation [at least see McCabe Figs. 3, 4; paras.
      0023, 0025, 0028, 0029 which teaches a wireless control system for a pallet
      truck which includes a processor which turns the input signal into a digital
      signal applies an encryption code to said digital signal and transmits the encrypted
      signal to the receiver on the pallet truck and a receiver on the pallet truck
      which demodulates the signal and compares it to the encryption code that is
      stored in memory if the encryption code is correct, the signal is passed to
      the controller on the pallet truck].\\nAccordingly, it would be obvious to a
      person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to modify
      the teaching of Finkle to include the signal encryption as taught by McCabe
      in order to distinguish the control signals from multiple operators when multiple
      vehicles are being operated in the same vicinity (McCabe 0028).\\nFinkle does
      not disclose wherein the remote control automatically generates the initial
      code for permitting the controller to execute the spontaneous identification
      and automatically un-lock said initial code and to automatically decode and
      relock the initial code when the remote  control is shut off or beyond a detection
      distance from the receiver at a first frequency of the dual frequencies and
      wherein the control signals emitted from said remote control are transmitted
      at a second frequency of the dual frequencies.\u201D  However, McCabe in combination
      with Kagaya teaches this limitation [at least see McCabe Figs. 3, 4; paras.
      0023, 0025, 0028, 0029 which teaches a wireless control system for a pallet
      truck which includes a processor which turns the input signal into a digital
      signal applies an encryption code to said digital signal and transmits the encrypted
      signal to the receiver on the pallet truck and a receiver on the pallet truck
      which demodulates the signal and compares it to the encryption code that is
      stored in memory if the encryption code is correct, the signal is passed to
      the controller on the pallet truck and as discussed above Kagaya Abstract; para.
      0020 teaches a remote control system that has a dual tone multi-frequency signal
      generating unit and a retransmission unit].\\nAccordingly, it would be obvious
      to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to
      modify the teaching of Finkle to include the signal encryption as taught by
      McCabe in order to distinguish the control signals from multiple operators when
      multiple vehicles are being operated in the same vicinity (McCabe 0028) and
      it would be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time
      of the invention to modify the teaching of Finkle to use multiple frequencies
      as taught by Kagaya because in radio controlled transmissions, simultaneous
      transmissions from a common base through the same frequency is difficult when
      there is a possibility of interference among other signals. (Kagaya 0008).\\nFinkle
      also does not disclose at least three touch switches disposed on said remote
      control respectively controlling an accelerating cruise, a decelerating cruise,
      and a brake of said brushless motor.  However, McDonough teaches this limitation
      [at least see McDonough Fig. 3 at (126), (132), (133), Fig 4 at (144), (146),
      (147), (148); which teaches a remote control for controlling the motor of a
      ceiling fan including a fan motor on/off button (144) and air flow  reverse
      button (148) (brake), fast button (146) (accelerating cruise), and slow button
      (147) (decelerating cruise)].  Accordingly, it would be obvious to a person
      having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to modify the
      teaching of Finkle to include a user interface as taught by McDonough because
      of the need to efficiently transmit user commands to control the motor.\\nRegarding
      Claim 2 (amended), Finkle discloses wherein, in said remote driving device,
      at least one active wheel is connected to a synchronizing wheel on said brushless
      motor via a synchronizing tape [at least see Finkle Figs. 2-9 teaching an electric
      motor for a skateboard driving a wheel of the skate board using a toothed belt].\\nRegarding
      Claim 6, Finkle does not teach said remote control comprises a further touch
      switch which serves to control a reversing of said brushless motor.  However,
      McDonough teaches this limitations [at least see McDonough Fig 4 at (148); which
      teaches a remote control for controlling the motor of a ceiling fan a ceiling
      fan including a fan motor reverse button (at (148)]. \\nAccordingly, it would
      be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention
      to modify the teaching of Finkle to include a reverse tough switch as taught
      by McDonough because of the need to efficiently transmit user commands to the
      motor.\\nRegarding Claim 8, Finkle discloses wherein, said remote control adopts
      a potential sliding stem to emit said control signals to said controller; said
      potential sliding stem includes a sliding buckle whose displacement amount decides
      a self-velocity of said skateboard, whereby said skateboard attains an average
      velocity while said sliding buckle is clutched backward and a deceleration effect
      while said sliding buckle is moved forward to its original position; said sliding
      buckle moved frontward over a certain limited angle serves to trigger a brake
      motion. [at least see Finkle Figs. 1, 11, column 4, lines 25-46].\\nnumber='10'Regarding
      Claim 14, Finkle discloses wherein, a battery box is disposed on said lower
      surface of said skateboard; said battery box includes a bottom surface and two
      side surfaces; a first groove is defined on the bottom of said battery box for
      intercommunicating and fitting with a second groove defined on said skateboard
      while installing said battery box; a power socket defined on said battery box
      connects to said controller and tightly engages with a plug on said controller
      [at least see Finkle Figs. 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15; column 3, lines 21-54 which
      teaches an electric powered skateboard with 2 batteries held in a battery box
      mounted to the bottom of the skateboard which includes a polymeric block on
      two sides and two groves in each block for connecting the batteries (at (29),
      (36) and column 3, lines 43-54) (a battery box is disposed on said lower surface
      of said skateboard; said battery box includes a bottom surface and two side
      surfaces; a first groove is defined on the bottom of said battery box for intercommunicating
      and fitting with a second groove defined on said skateboard while installing
      said battery box) and teaches a motor control unit mounted to the bottom of
      the skateboard for controlling the speed of the skateboard (Fig,4 at (30) (a
      power socket defined on said battery box connects to said controller and tightly
      engages with a plug on said controller) ]. \\nRegarding Claim 15, Finkle discloses
      wherein, a secure lock is disposed inside said battery box [at least see Finkle
      Fig. 4 at (38), column 3, lines 51-54) which teaches a pair of spring loaded
      retainers to hold the batteries in place.  \\nRegarding Claim 16, Finkle does
      not explicitly disclose wherein, at least one set of Li-ion battery is included
      in the battery box.  However, it would have been obvious to one having ordinary
      skill in the art at the time of the invention was made to use a li-ion battery
      to power the electric skateboard since this is a substitution of known equivalents
      and involves only routine skill in the art. In re Scott, 139 USPQ 297. \\nnumber='11'Regarding
      Claim 17, Finkle discloses wherein, said Li-ion battery adopts the voltage of
      12V to 36V [at least see Finkle column 3, lines 21-39 which teaches using two
      12 volt batteries as a power source for an electric skateboard]. \\nClaim 7
      and 13 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Finkle
      in view of Kagaya, in view of Gass, in view of McCabe and in further view of
      McDonough or Phillips et al. US 2008/0086241 A1.\\nRegarding Claim 7, Finkle
      does not disclose said four touch switches on said remote control are an accelerating
      cruise button, a decelerating button, a reverse button, and a brake button,
      respectively.  However, McDonough or Phillips teaches this limitation [at least
      see McDonough Fig. 3 at (126), (132), (133), Fig 4 at (144), (146), (147), (148);
      which teaches a remote control for controlling the motor of a ceiling fan including
      a fan motor on/off button (144) and air flow reverse button (148) (brake), fast
      button (146) (accelerating cruise), and slow button (147) (decelerating cruise)
      or Phillips Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4; para. 0076, 0080 which teaches a controller for
      a robot where the left joystick controls the drive movement of the robot (forward,
      backward, left, right; a right button array) where one of the buttons controls
      the vehicle\u2019s speed (accelerating cruise, decelerating cruise, reverse);
      and an upper left button which is a pause or brake button (brake) for the robot].\\nAccordingly,
      it would be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time
      of the invention to modify the teaching of Finkle to include a user interface
      as taught by McDonough or Phillips because of the need to efficiently transmit
      user commands to the controller.\\nRegarding Claim 13, Finkle does not teach
      wherein, said controller would automatically emit a stop signal to stop said
      skateboard when said controller beyond a remote-control distance fails to receive
      said signals from said remote control; said effective remote-control number='12'distance
      between said remote control and said controller is within 3 meters. However,
      Phillips teaches this limitation [at least see Phillips para. 0203 which teaches
      powering down the robot when communication is lost with the control system].\\nAccordingly
      it would be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time
      of the invention to modify the teaching of Finkle to program the controller
      to stop the robot as taught by Phillips when the vehicle controller is no longer
      in communication with the remote control because of the need for the controller
      to perform an autonomous task when not in communication with the remote ((Phillips
      paras. 0004, 0005, 0243).\\nClaim 9 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being
      unpatentable over Finkle in view of Kagaya, in view of Gass, in view of McCabe,
      in view of McDonough and in further view of Hillman et al. US 2006/0032682.
      \ \\nRegarding Claim 9, Finkle does not teach wherein, a back switch is disposed
      on a top portion of said remote control.  However, this limitation is taught
      by Hillman combined with McDonough [at least see Hillman Fig. 9, 10, 11, para
      0057, 0058 which teaches a handheld remote for controlling a motorized skateboard
      with a brake button on the top of the controller to be operated by the user\u2019s
      thumb (disposed on a top portion of said remote control) and McDonough which
      teaches a remote control for controlling the motor of a ceiling fan which includes
      an air flow reverse button (148) (back switch)].  \\nAccordingly, it would be
      obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention
      to modify the teaching of Finkle to include a button on top of the remote as
      taught by Hillman and to connect the button to a reverse mode for the motor
      as taught by McDonough because of the need for a user interface to efficiently
      transmit user commands to the motor.number='13'\\nClaims 10 and 11 are rejected
      under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Finkle in view of Kagaya,
      in view of Gass, in view of McCabe, in view of McDonough and in further view
      of Erdman US 4,459,519.  \\nRegarding Claim 10, Finkle does not teach wherein,
      said brushless motor adopts a high speed permanent magnet synchronous motor
      whose highest rotational speed is 950 to 5100 RPM.  However, Erdman teaches
      this limitation [at least see Erdman Figs. 11, 12].\\nRegarding Claim 11, Finkle
      does not teach wherein, said high speed permanent magnet synchronous motor possesses
      at least 75% to 95% horsepower energy and 12V to 36V voltage. However, Erdman
      teaches this limitation [at least see Erdman Figs. 11, 12].\\nAccordingly, it
      would be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of
      the invention to modify the teaching of Finkle to select an efficient brushless
      motor based on the speed and voltage required as taught by Erdman (Figs. 11,
      12) to ensure the longest running time for a given battery configuration.\\nClaims
      18, 23, 25, 31, 32, 33, and 34  are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being
      unpatentable over Finkle in view of Kagaya and in view of Crigler et al. US
      2006/0049595 A1 and in view of McCabe and in further view of McDonough.\\nRegarding
      Claim 18 (amended), Finkle discloses a remote control electric powered skateboard
      having a board with an upper rider-support surface and a lower surface supporting
      a plurality of wheels, and further comprising: a remote control [at least see
      Finkle fig 1 (char 12); fig 11]; a controller, wherein the remote control communicates
      with the controller \u2026 a receiver [at least see Finkle fig 10 which discloses
      a transmitter (char 54) a receiver (char 45) and a speed control (char 48) connected

      a reverse rotation [at least see Finkle Abstract; column 1, lines 55-67, column
      3, lines 48], but does not disclose communication via dual frequencies.  However,
      Kagaya teaches this limitation [at least see Kagaya Abstract; para. 0020 which
      teaches a remote control system that has a dual tone multi-frequency signal
      generating unit and a retransmission unit which reads on said remote control
      communicates with said controller through dual frequencies].\\nAccordingly,
      it would be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time
      of the invention to modify the teaching of Finkle to use multiple frequencies
      as taught by Kagaya because in radio controlled transmissions, simultaneous
      transmissions from a common base through the same frequency is difficult when
      there is a possibility of interference among other signals. (Kagaya 0008).\\nFinkle
      does not explicitly disclose a brushless hub motor. However, Crigler teaches
      this limitation [at least see Crigler Fig. 9; paras. 0063, 0064 which teaches
      a brushless hub motor for a motorized skateboard].\\nAccordingly, it would be
      obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention
      to modify the teaching of Finkle to include a brushless hub motor as taught
      by number='15'Crigler because brushless motors are more reliable, require less
      maintenance, increased efficiency, and allow for electric reversing (Gass 0064)
      and hub motors have fewer moving parts.\\nFinkle does not disclose wherein the
      controller provides an automatic comparison function; when said remote control

      on after said remote control is shut off; said receiver receiving control signals
      emitted from said remote control, said controller thence decoding said signals
      so as to dispatch distinct commands to said brushless motor.  However, McCabe

      the signal and compares it to the encryption code that is stored in memory if
      the encryption code is correct, the signal is passed to the controller on the
      pallet truck].  \\nAccordingly, it would be obvious to a person having ordinary
      skill in the art at the time of the invention to modify the teaching of Finkle
      to add the signal encryption as taught by McCabe in order to distinguish the
      signals from multiple operators when multiple vehicles are being operated in

      disposed on said remote control respectively controlling an accelerating cruise,
      a decelerating cruise, and a brake of said brushless motor.  However, McDonough
      teaches this limitation [at least see McDonough Fig. 3 at (126), (132), (133),

      whose displacement amount decides a self-velocity of said skateboard displacing
      amount, whereby said skateboard attains an average velocity while said sliding
      buckle is clutched backward and a deceleration effect while said sliding buckle
      is moved forward to its original position; said sliding buckle moved frontward

      to hold the batteries in place].  \\nRegarding Claim 33, Finkle discloses does
      not explicitly teach wherein, at least one set of Li-ion battery is included
      in the battery box.  However, it would have been obvious to one having ordinary
      skill in the art at the time of the invention was made to use a li-ion battery
      to power the electric skateboard since this is a substitution of known equivalents
      and involves only routine skill in the art. In re Scott, 139 USPQ 297. \\nRegarding
      Claim 34, Finkle discloses wherein, said Li-ion battery adopts the voltage of

      on said remote control are an accelerating cruise button, a decelerating button,
      a reverse button, and a brake button, respectively.  However, McDonough or Phillips
      teaches this limitation [at least see McDonough Fig. 3 at (126), (132), (133),

      further view of Hillman.  \\nRegarding Claim 26, Finkle does not teach wherein,
      a back switch is disposed on a top portion of said remote control.  However,
      this limitation is taught by Hillman combined with McDonough [at least see Hillman

      controlling a motorized skateboard with a brake button on the top of the controller
      to be operated by the user\u2019s thumb (disposed on a top portion of said remote
      control) and McDonough which teaches a remote control for controlling the motor
      of a ceiling fan which includes an air flow reverse button (148) (back switch)].

      art at the time of the invention to modify the teaching of Finkle to include
      a button on top of the remote as taught by Hillman and to connect the button
      to a reverse mode for the motor as taught by McDonough because of the need for

      not teach wherein, said brushless hub motor adopts a high speed permanent magnet
      synchronous motor whose highest rotational speed is 950 to 5100 RPM.  However,
      Erdman teaches this limitation [at least see Erdman Figs. 11, 12].\\nRegarding

      motor possesses at least 75% to 95% horsepower energy and 12V to 36V voltage.
      However, Erdman teaches this limitation [at least see Erdman Figs. 11, 12].\\nAccordingly,
      it would be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time
      of the invention to modify the teaching of Finkle to select an efficient brushless

      when said controller beyond a remote-control distance fails to receive said
      signals from said remote control; said effective remote-control distance between
      said remote control and said controller is within 3 meters. However, Phillips
      teaches this limitation [at least see Phillips para. 0203 which teaches powering
      down the robot when communication is lost with the control system].\\nAccordingly
      it would be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time
      of the invention to modify the teaching of Finkle to program the controller
      to stop the robot as taught by Phillips when the vehicle controller is no longer
      in communication with the remote control because of the need for the controller

      in said indentation, and a through hole being defined on a front section of
      said upper rider-support surface for being engaged with a base on a bottom of

      handle foldable as taught by Heringer to ensure that the handle of an electric
      skateboard cannot be inadvertently lowered into the folding position (Heringer

      the handle as taught by Chen to accommodate riders of different heights.\\nFinkle
      does not explicitly disclose a brushless or brushless hub motor.  However, Gass
      combined with Crigler teaches this limitation [at least see Gass para. 0064,
      0078, 0086 which teaches a brushless motor and Crigler Fig. 9; paras. 0063,
      0064 which teaches a brushless hub motor for a motorized skateboard]. \\nAccordingly,
      it would be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time
      of the invention to modify the teaching of Finkle to include a brushless motor
      taught by Gass or the brushless hub motor as taught by Crigler because brushless
      motors are more reliable, require less maintenance, increased efficiency, and
      allow for electric reversing (Gass 0064) and hub motors have fewer moving parts
      (Crigler, Fig. 9).\\nFinkle also does not disclose a remote control wherein
      the controller provides an automatic comparison function; when said remote control
      is subjected to electrification allowing an automatic generation of an initial
      code for permitting the controller to execute a spontaneous identification and
      automatically un-lock said initial code; wherein an automatic decoding is carried
      on after said remote control is shut off; said receiver receiving control signals
      emitted from said remote handle or the remote control, said controller thence
      decoding said signals so number='26'as to dispatch distinct commands to said
      brushless motor or hub motor, thereby allowing various actions pursuant to said

      is passed to the controller on the pallet truck].  \\nAccordingly, it would
      be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention
      to modify the teaching of Finkle to add the signal encryption as taught by McCabe
      in order to distinguish the signals from multiple operators when multiple vehicles
      are being operated in the same vicinity (McCabe 0028).\\nFinkle does not disclose
      wherein the remote control automatically generates the initial code for permitting
      the controller to execute the spontaneous identification and automatically un-lock
      said initial code and to automatically decode and relock the initial code when
      the remote control is shut off or beyond a detection distance from the receiver
      at a first frequency of the dual frequencies and wherein the control signals
      emitted from said remote control are transmitted at a second frequency of the
      dual frequencies.\\nHowever, McCabe in combination with Kagaya teaches this

      the encryption code is correct, the signal is passed to the controller on the
      pallet truck and as discussed above Kagaya Abstract; para. 0020 teaches a remote
      control system that has a dual tone multi-frequency signal generating unit and
      a retransmission unit].\\nAccordingly, it would be obvious to a person having
      ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to modify the teaching
      of Finkle to include the signal encryption as taught by McCabe in order to distinguish
      the control signals from multiple operators when multiple vehicles are being
      operated in the same vicinity (McCabe 0028) and it would be obvious to a person
      having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to modify the
      teaching of Finkle to use multiple frequencies as taught by Kagaya because in
      radio controlled transmissions, simultaneous transmissions from a common base
      through the same frequency is difficult when there is a possibility of interference
      among other signals. (Kagaya 0008).\\nFinkle also does not teach at least three
      touch switches disposed on each of said remote control and the remote handle
      respectively and controlling an accelerating cruise, a decelerating cruise,
      and a brake of said brushless motor or said brushless hub motor.  However, McDonough
      teaches this limitation [at least see McDonough Fig. 3 at (126), (132), (133),
      Fig 4 at (144), (146), (147), (148); which teaches a remote control for controlling
      the motor of a ceiling fan including a fan motor on/off button (144) and air
      flow reverse button (148) (brake), fast button (146) (accelerating cruise),
      and slow button (147) (decelerating cruise)].\\nAccordingly, it would be obvious
      to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to
      modify the teaching of Finkle to add one or more user interfaces between the
      user and the motorized device as taught by McDonough because of the need to
      efficiently transmit user commands from the interface to the motor.\\nnumber='28'Regarding
      Claim 37, Finkle discloses wherein, said remote  [electric] motor or said [electric]
      motor, but does not explicitly teach a handle or brushless motor or brushless
      hub motor. However, McLeese teaches a handle bar for an electric powered skateboard
      [at least see McLeese Fig. 8 at (10), (12), (80), (92); para. 0040], Gass teaches
      a brushless motor [at least see Gass para. 0064, 0078, 0086] and Crigler teaches
      use of a brushless hub motor [at least see Crigler Fig. 9; paras. 0063, 0064].
      \ \\nAccordingly, it would be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the
      art at the time of the invention to modify the teaching of Finkle to include
      a handle taught by McLeese in order to provide a handle as an accessory for
      the rider\u2019s convenience (McLeese para. 0021, 0040) and the brushless motor
      taught by Gass and the brushless hub motor taught by Crigler because brushless
      motors are more reliable, require less maintenance, increased efficiency, and
      allow for electric reversing (Gass 0064) and hub motors have fewer moving parts.\\n
      \ Regarding Claim 43 (amended), Finkle discloses a sliding buckle for controlling
      the speed of a motorized skateboard (wherein, ), but does not teaches does not
      teach said reverse button.  However, McDonough teaches this limitations [at
      least see McDonough Fig 4 at (148); which teaches a remote control for controlling
      the motor of a ceiling fan a ceiling fan including a fan motor reverse button
      (at (148)]. \\nAccordingly, it would be obvious to a person having ordinary
      skill in the art at the time of the invention to modify the teaching of Finkle
      to include a reverse button as taught by McDonough because of the need to efficiently
      transmit user commands to the motor and the benefit to the user of the option
      to reverse the direction of a skateboard.\\nnumber='29'Regarding Claim 44, Finkle
      does not teach wherein, said brushless motor and said brushless hub motor adopt
      a high speed permanent magnet synchronous motor.  However, Gass and Crigler
      teach this limitation.  Gass teaches a permanent magnet brushless motor [at
      least see Gass para. 0064, 0078, 0086 (brushless motor \u2026 adopt(s) a high
      speed permanent magnet synchronous motor] and Crigler teaches use of a permanent
      magnet brushless hub motor [at least see Crigler Fig. 9; paras. 0063, 0064 which
      teaches a brushless hub motor with a plurality of magnets fixed to the inner
      diameter of the hub wheel casing for a motorized skateboard (brushless hub motor
      adopt a high speed permanent magnet synchronous motor)].\\nAccordingly, it would
      be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention
      to modify the teaching of Finkle to include a permanent magnet brushless motor
      taught by Gass or the permanent magnet brushless hub motor as taught by Crigler
      because brushless motors are more reliable, require less maintenance, increased
      efficiency, and allow for electric reversing (Gass 0064) and hub motors have
      fewer moving parts.\\nRegarding Claim 47, Finkle discloses wherein, a battery
      box is disposed on said lower surface of said skateboard; said battery box includes
      a bottom surface and two side surfaces; a first groove is defined on the bottom
      of said battery box for intercommunicating and fitting with a second groove
      defined on said skateboard while installing said battery box; a power socket
      defined on said battery box connects to said controller and tightly engages
      with a plug on said controller [at least see Finkle Figs. 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12,
      15; column 3, lines 21-54 which teaches an electric powered skateboard with
      2 batteries held in a battery box mounted to the bottom of the skateboard which
      includes a polymeric block on two sides and two groves in each block for connecting
      the batteries (at (29), (36) and column 3, lines 43-54) (a battery box is disposed
      on said lower surface of said skateboard; said battery box includes a bottom
      surface and two side surfaces; a first groove is defined on the bottom of said
      battery box for intercommunicating and number='30'fitting with a second groove
      defined on said skateboard while installing said battery box) and teaches a
      motor control unit mounted to the bottom of the skateboard for controlling the
      speed of the skateboard (Fig,4 at (30) (a power socket defined on said battery
      box connects to said controller and tightly engages with a plug on said controller)
      ]. \\nRegarding Claim 48, Finkle t discloses wherein, a secure lock is disposed
      inside said battery box [at least see Finkle Fig. 4 at (38), column 3, lines
      51-54) which teaches a pair of spring loaded retainers to hold the batteries
      in place.  \\nRegarding Claim 49, Finkle discloses does not explicitly teach
      wherein, at least one set of Li-ion battery is included in the battery box.
      \ However, it would have been obvious to one having ordinary skill in the art
      at the time of the invention was made to use a li-ion battery to power the electric
      skateboard since this is a substitution of known equivalents and involves only
      routine skill in the art. In re Scott, 139 USPQ 297. \\nRegarding Claim 50,
      Finkle discloses wherein, said Li-ion battery adopts the voltage of 12V to 36V
      [at least see Finkle column 3, lines 21-39 which teaches using two 12 volt batteries
      as a power source for an electric skateboard]. \\nClaim 36 is rejected under
      35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable under Finkle in view of Kagaya, in view
      of Gass, in view of Crigler, in view of McCabe, in view of McDonough, in view
      of McLeese, in view of Heringer, in further view of Chen and in further view
      of Pouchkarev US 6,439,940 B1.\\nRegarding Claim 36, Finkle does not disclose
      wherein, a cover covers said through hole and said opening after removing said
      auxiliary remote device, which permits said electric powered skateboard to be
      operated by said remote control, thence achieving an all-purpose effect.  However,
      Pouchkarev teaches this limitation [at least see Pouchkarev Fig. 5, column 4,
      lines 23-32 which teaches a removable sealing plug for a fin and watercraft
      system].\\nnumber='31'   \\tAccordingly, it would be obvious to a person having
      ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to modify the teaching
      of Finkle to include a plug to fit in the opening as taught by Pouchkarev to
      seal the opening and protect the rider (Pouchkarev column 4, lines 30-32).\\nClaim
      46 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable under Finkle in
      view of Kagaya, in view of Gass, in view of Crigler, in view of McCabe, in view
      of McDonough, in view of McLeese, in view of Heringer, in view of Chen and in
      further view of Phillips.\\nRegarding Claim 46, Finkle does not teach wherein,
      said controller would automatically emit a stop signal to stop said skateboard
      when said controller beyond a remote-control distance fails to receive said
      signals from said remote control; said effective remote-control distance between
      said remote control and said controller is within 3 meters. However, Phillips
      teaches this limitation [at least see Phillips para. 0203 which teaches powering
      down the robot when communication is lost with the control system].\\nAccordingly
      it would be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time
      of the invention to modify the teaching of Finkle to program the controller
      to stop the robot as taught by Phillips when the vehicle controller is no longer
      in communication with the remote control because of the need for the controller
      to perform an autonomous task when not in communication with the remote in order
      to protect the vehicle and bystanders (Phillips paras. 0004, 0005, 0243).\\n\\nResponse
      to Applicants Arguments\\nRegarding 35 U.S.C. \xA7 112 Rejection\\nThe rejections
      under 35 U.S.C. \xA7 112, first paragraph to Claims 3, 5, 20 ,22, 38, and 40
      have been overcome by the cancellation of those claims by the Applicants.\\nThe
      rejections under 35 U.S.C. \xA7 112, second paragraph to Claims 12, 29, and
      45 have been overcome by the cancellation of those claims by the Applicants.\\nThe
      rejections under 35 U.S.C. \xA7 112, second paragraph to Claims 23, 24, and
      43 have been overcome by Applicants\u2019 amendments to Claims 23 and 43.\\nRegarding
      35 U.S.C. \xA7 103 Rejection\\nApplicants arguments filed on September 10, 2012
      have been fully considered but they are not persuasive.\\nIn response to Applicant's
      argument that the references fail to show certain features of Applicants invention,
      it is noted that the features upon which applicant relies (i.e., wherein the
      remote control automatically generates the initial code for permitting the controller
      to execute the spontaneous identification and automatically un-lock said initial
      code and to automatically decode and relock the initial code when the remote
      control is shut off or beyond a detection distance from the receiver at a first
      frequency of the dual frequencies and wherein the control signals emitted from
      said remote control are transmitted at a second frequency of the dual frequencies)
      was added to Claims 1, 18, and 35 via amendment and was not recited in the rejected
      claim.  Please see 35 U.S.C. \xA7 103 rejection above regarding the rejection
      of these amended claims.\\nApplicants argue that the Examiner has not provided
      articulate reasoning with some rational underpinning to support the legal conclusion
      of obviousness for combining references.  number='32'First a rejection of a
      claimed invention in accordance with 35 U.S.C. \xA7 103 is not improper simply
      because of the number of references cited.  Reliance on a large number of references
      in a rejection does not, without more, weigh against the obviousness of the
      claimed invention.  See In re Gorman, 933 F.2d 982, 18 USPQ2d 1885 (Fed. Cir.
      1991).  Additionally, in regard to Applicant\u2019s assertion that there is
      no teaching, suggestion, or motivation to combine the references, the Examiner
      recognizes that obviousness may be established by combining or modifying the
      teachings of the prior art to produce the claimed invention where there is some
      teaching, suggestion, or motivation to do so found either in the references
      themselves or in the knowledge generally available to one of ordinary skill
      in the art.  See In re Fine, 837 F.2d 1071, 5 USPQ2d 1596 (Fed. Cir. 1988),
      In re Jones, 958 F.2d 347, 21 USPQ2d 1941 (Fed. Cir. 1992), and KSR International
      Co. v. Teleflex, Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 82 USPQ2d 1385 (2007).  In this case, the
      prior art cited to reject Applicants\u2019 claims are analogous art or reasonably
      pertinent to the particular problem with which the Applicants were concerned
      with because the prior art references cited in the previous office action and
      this office action are related to personalized vehicles, motorized personal
      vehicles, controls for personal vehicles, controls for electric motors, or batteries
      for electric motors.  In addition, the previous rejections clearly set forth
      the Examiner\u2019s reasoning for combining the references and Applicants have
      not specifically pointed out why the Government has failed to establish a prima
      facia case of obviousness.\\nConclusion\\nTHIS ACTION IS MADE FINAL.  Applicant
      is reminded of the extension of time policy as set forth in 37 CFR 1.136(a).
      \ \\nA shortened statutory period for reply to this final action is set to expire
      THREE MONTHS from the mailing date of this action.  In the event a first reply
      is filed within TWO MONTHS of the mailing date of this final action and the
      advisory action is not mailed until after number='33'the end of the THREE-MONTH
      shortened statutory period, then the shortened statutory period will expire
      on the date the advisory action is mailed, and any extension fee pursuant to
      37 CFR 1.136(a) will be calculated from the mailing date of the advisory action.
      \ In no event, however, will the statutory period for reply expire later than
      SIX MONTHS from the mailing date of this final action. \\nAny inquiry concerning

      2013, is being examined under the first inventor to file provisions of the AIA
      . \\nDETAILED ACTION\\nDETAILED ACTION\\n\\nElection/Restrictions\\nRestriction
      to one of the following inventions is required under 35 U.S.C. 121:\\nI. Claim
      1-16, drawn to a light emitting device.\\nII. Claim 17-18, drawn to a method
      of forming a device.\\nThe inventions are distinct, each from the other because
      of the following reasons:\\nInventions II and I are related as process of making
      and product made.  The inventions are distinct if either or both of the following
      can be shown: (1) that the process as claimed can be used to make another and
      materially different product or (2) that the product as claimed can be made
      by another and materially different process (MPEP \xA7 806.05(f)).  In the instant
      case The grooves can be formed first and the LED situated with respect to the
      grooves.\\n\\nSpecies\\nFigure 1\\nFigure 2\\nFigure 4\\nFigure 5 \\nThe species
      are independent or distinct because as disclosed the different species have
      mutually exclusive characteristics for each identified species. In addition,
      these species are not obvious variants of each other based on the current record.\\nApplicant
      is required under 35 U.S.C. 121 to elect a single disclosed species, or a single
      grouping of patentably indistinct species, for prosecution on the merits to
      which the claims shall be restricted if no generic claim is finally held to
      be allowable.\\nThere is a search and/or examination burden for the patentably
      distinct species as set forth above because at least the following reason(s)
      apply: \\nThe grooves and the number LEDs and the bottom contacts and top are
      shaped differently and  applicant has not shown an embodiment including all
      the features.\\nApplicant is advised that the reply to this requirement to be
      complete must include (i) an election of a species or a grouping of patentably
      indistinct species to be examined even though the requirement may be traversed
      (37 CFR 1.143) and (ii) identification of the claims encompassing the elected
      species or grouping of patentably indistinct species, including any claims subsequently
      added. An argument that a claim is allowable or that all claims are generic
      is considered nonresponsive unless accompanied by an election.\\nThe election
      may be made with or without traverse. To preserve a right to petition, the election
      must be made with traverse. If the reply does not distinctly and specifically
      point out supposed errors in the election of species requirement, the election
      shall be treated as an election without traverse. Traversal must be presented
      at the time of election in order to be considered timely. Failure to timely
      traverse the requirement  will result in the loss of right to petition under
      37 CFR 1.144. If claims are added after the election, applicant must indicate
      which of these claims are readable on the elected species or grouping of patentably
      indistinct species.\\nShould applicant traverse on the ground that the species,
      or groupings of patentably indistinct species from which election is required,
      are not patentably distinct, applicant should submit evidence or identify such
      evidence now of record showing the species to be obvious variants or clearly
      admit on the record that this is the case. In either instance, if the examiner
      finds one of the species unpatentable over the prior art, the evidence or admission
      may be used in a rejection under 35 U.S.C. 103 or pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a)
      of the other species.\\nUpon the allowance of a generic claim, applicant will
      be entitled to consideration of claims to additional species which depend from
      or otherwise require all the limitations of an allowable generic claim as provided
      by 37 CFR 1.141.\\n\\nConclusion\\nThe examiner has required restriction between
      product or apparatus claims and process claims. Where applicant elects claims
      directed to the product/apparatus, and all product/apparatus claims are subsequently
      found allowable, withdrawn process claims that include all the limitations of
      the allowable product/apparatus claims should be considered for rejoinder. All
      claims directed to a nonelected process invention must include all the limitations
      of an allowable product/apparatus claim for that process invention to be rejoined.
      \\n In the event of rejoinder, the requirement for restriction between the product/apparatus
      claims and the rejoined process claims will be withdrawn, and the rejoined process
      claims will be fully examined for patentability in accordance with 37 CFR 1.104.
      Thus, to be allowable, the rejoined claims must meet all criteria for patentability
      including the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 101, 102, 103 and 112. Until all claims
      to the elected product/apparatus are found allowable, an otherwise proper restriction
      requirement between product/apparatus claims and process claims may be maintained.
      Withdrawn process claims that are not commensurate in scope with an allowable
      product/apparatus claim will not be rejoined. See MPEP \xA7 821.04. Additionally,
      in order for rejoinder to occur, applicant is advised that the process claims
      should be amended during prosecution to require the limitations of the product/apparatus
      claims. Failure to do so may result in no rejoinder. Further, note that the
      prohibition against double patenting rejections of 35 U.S.C. 121 does not apply
      where the restriction requirement is withdrawn by the examiner before the patent
      issues. See MPEP \xA7 804.01.\\nAny inquiry concerning this communication or

      Patent Application No. 20080065606 to Boys et al. (hereinafter Boys).\\nReferring
      to Claims 1 and 16-18 (substantially similar in scope and language), the combination
      of Visioli and Boys teaches a method, system and device for identifying a property
      for purchase by an image processing system, comprising: \\nVisioli discloses:\\nidentifying
      one or more property attributes within the one or more images.\\nSpecifically,
      Visioli discloses the system identifying various property attributes based on
      a selected image by the user (see at least Visioli: Col. 3 Line 27-52, Col.
      4 Line 1-14, and Col. 4 Line 35-46).\\nVisioli further discloses:\\ngenerating
      image data, the image data including the one or more images and the one or more
      property attributes; and\\nextracting user preference information directly from
      the image data, the user preference information including one or more preferred
      aesthetic property attributes.\\nSpecifically, Visioli discloses the system
      generating and using the image data, such as various property attributes associated
      with the image, to extract user preference information from the image of the
      user\u2019s aesthetic property attributes that prefer (see at least Visioli:
      Col. 2 Line  55-67, Col. 3 Line 27-52, Col. 4 Line 1-14, Col. 4 Line 35-67,
      Col. 5 Line 15-36, Col. 5 Line 58-67, and Col. 6 Line 29-63).\\nVisioli further
      discloses: \\nsearching an available property database using the user preference
      information; \\nreceiving available property information from the available
      property database that matches the user preference information, the available
      property information including information relating to one or more properties
      that are available for purchase; and \\npresenting the available property information
      on a display.\\nSpecifically, Visioli discloses the system using the various
      preference information gained from the image data in searching the property
      database to receive information regarding available properties for purchase
      that match the preferences and presenting the properties to the user (see at
      least Visioli: Col. 1 Line 58-67, Col. 2 Line 1-18, Col. 3 Line 15-40, Col.
      3 Line 53-65, Col. 4 Line 1-14, Col. 4 Line 35-46, Col. 4 Line 63-67, Col. 5
      Line 1-57 and Col. 6 Line 47-63).\\nVisioli, while disclosing receiving image
      selections from users that are associated to various property attributes as
      well as the system storing the images, fails to state:\\nreceiving one or more
      images from a user device, wherein the one or more images are images of properties,
      and wherein the user device one or more of captures, selects, and stores the
      one or more images.\\n\\tBoys, which talks about using imagery data for search
      functions, teaches it is known for a user to input an image of a property and
      the system to search and present available properties that match the image and
      architecture of the property (Boys: \xB6 79).\\n Therefore, it would have been
      obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of filing to apply the
      known technique of receiving an image from the user of a piece of property in
      order for the system to return similar properties based on the image (as disclosed
      by Boys) to the known method and system for identifying a property for purchase
      using an image (as disclosed by Visioli) to enable images to be searched based
      on submitting an image or image data.  One of ordinary skill in the art would
      have been motivated to apply the known technique of receiving an image from
      the user of a piece of property in order for the system to return similar properties
      based on the image because it would enable images to be searched based on submitting
      an image or image data (see Boys: \xB6 8).  \\nFurthermore, it would have been
      obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of filing to apply the
      known technique of receiving an image from the user of a piece of property in
      order for the system to return similar properties based on the image (as disclosed
      by Boys) to the known method and system for identifying a property for purchase
      using an image (as disclosed by Visioli) to enable images to be searched based
      on submitting an image or image data, because the claimed invention is merely
      applying a known technique to a known method ready for improvement to yield
      predictable results.  See KSR Int\u2019l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398,
      406 (2007).  In other words, all of the claimed elements were known in the prior
      art and one skilled in the art could have combined the elements as claimed by
      known methods with no change in their respective functions, and the combination
      would have yielded nothing more than predictable results to one of ordinary
      skill in the art at the time of the invention (i.e., predictable results are
      obtained by applying the known technique of receiving an image from the user
      of a piece of property in order for the system to return similar properties
      based on the image to the known method and system for identifying a property
      for purchase using an image to enable number='10'images to be searched based
      on submitting an image or image data).  See also MPEP \xA7 2143(I)(D).\\nReferring
      to Claims 16 and 17, the claims contain the additional limitations directed

      in the preference information that is discussed in the rejection and the third
      party information such as the MLS information (see at least: Visioli: Col. 3
      Line 4-14).\\nReferring to Claim 2, the combination of Visioli and Boys teaches
      the method of claim 1; Visioli further discloses receiving user information
      from a customer database, the user information including information relating
      to a user; searching the available property database using the user preference
      information and the user information; and, receiving available property information
      from the available property data that matches the user preference information
      and the user information (see at least: Visioli: Col. 1 Line 58-67, Col. 2 Line

      information related to the users in a databased that is used to search available
      properties in order for the user to receive the results of the search).\\nReferring
      to Claim 3, the combination of Visioli and Boys teaches the method of claim
      2; Visioli further discloses selecting a recommended property from the available
      property information and presenting information pertaining to the recommended
      property on the display (see at least: see at least: Visioli: Col. 1 Line 58-67,

      the users selecting the various presenting information regarding available property
      information and displaying the information).\\nReferring to Claim 6, the combination
      of Visioli and Boys teaches the method of claim 1; Visioli further discloses
      wherein the user preference information includes one or more preferred functional
      property attributes (see at least: Visioli: Col. 5 Line 15-67 and Col. 6 Line
      1-15: discusses the user preference information containing information related
      to function property attributes).\\nReferring to Claim 7, the combination of
      Visioli and Boys teaches the method of claim 6; Visioli further discloses wherein
      the preferred functional property attributes include one or more of price, location,
      closing date, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, number of floors, square
      footage, size of lot, proximity to transit, proximity to schooling, and proximity
      to recreational activities (see at least: Visioli: Col. 5 Line 15-67 and Col.
      6 Line 1-15: discusses the number='12'user submitting information related to
      preferences relating to function aspects of the property such as location, number
      of bedrooms and bathrooms).\\nReferring to Claim 8, the combination of Visioli
      and Boys teaches the method of claim 1; Visioli further discloses wherein the
      user preference information includes a respective weighting for each preferred
      aesthetic property attribute (see at least: Visioli: Abstract, Col. 1 Line 58-67,
      Col. 2 Line 1-15, Col. 3 Line 27-65, Col. 4 Line 1-25, Col. 4 Line 35-53, Col.

      containing weighted ratings for each attribute).\\nReferring to Claim 9, the
      combination of Visioli and Boys teaches the method of claim 8; Visioli further
      discloses determining the respective weighting for each preferred aesthetic
      property attribute from the image data (see at least: Visioli: Abstract, Col.
      1 Line 58-67, Col. 2 Line 1-15, Col. 3 Line 27-65, Col. 4 Line 1-25, Col. 4

      to Claim 10, the combination of Visioli and Boys teaches the method of claim
      8; Visioli further discloses determining the respective weighting for each preferred
      aesthetic property attribute from the user information (see at least: Visioli:
      Abstract, Col. 1 Line 58-67, Col. 2 Line 1-15, Col. 3 Line 27-65, Col. 4 Line
      1-25, Col. 4 Line 35-53, Col. 5 Line 17-67, and Col. 6 Line 1-58: discusses
      the system determining the various weighted ratings for each preferred property
      attribute based on submitted user information).\\nReferring to Claim 11, the
      combination of Visioli and Boys teaches the method of claim 8; Visioli further
      discloses receiving the respective weighting for each preferred aesthetic property
      attribute from the user device (see at least: Visioli: Abstract, Col. 1 Line
      58-67, Col. 2 Line 1-15, Col. 3 Line 27-65, Col. 4 Line 1-25, Col. 4 Line 35-53,
      Col. 5 Line 17-67, and Col. 6 Line 1-58: discusses the users inputting various

      and Boys teaches the method of claim 1; Visioli further discloses wherein the
      property is one or more of a house, a vacation property, a rental property,
      a farm, and a condominium (see at least: Visioli: Col. 29-67: discusses that
      the property can be a house).\\nReferring to Claim 14, the combination of Visioli
      and Boys teaches the method of claim 1; Visioli further discloses wherein the
      images of properties are images of interiors and exteriors number='13'of properties
      (see at least Visioli: Col. 2 Line 55-67: discusses that the images related
      to architectural (exterior) features, scenery and d\xE9cor (interior)).\\nReferring
      to Claim 15, the combination of Visioli and Boys teaches the method of claim

      clips (see at least: Boys: \xB6 40: discusses that the system discusses that
      the search system can be used to search videos, audio, image and text).\\n Claim
      19 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable over U.S. Patent No.
      9104782 to Visioli et al. (hereinafter Visioli)  in view of U.S. Patent Application
      No. 20080065606 to Boys et al. (hereinafter Boys) in view of U.S. Patent No.
      6801909 to Delgado et al. (hereinafter Delgado).\\nReferring to Claim 19, the
      combination of Visioli and Boys teaches the method of claim 18; The combination,
      while discloses a method and system for generating property that is available
      for purchase or use, fails to explicitly state wherein the product for purchase
      includes a service for purchase or use and wherein the one or more products
      available for purchase include one or more services available for purchase or
      use.\\nDelgado, which talks about obtaining user preferences and providing user
      based recommendations, teaches it is known to use user preference information
      in order to generate various goods and services related to the preferences (see
      at least Delgado: Abstract, Col. 2 Line 59-62, Col. 3 Line 55-60, Col. 4 Line
      60-67, Col. 6 Line 1-14, and Col. 7 Line 1-15).\\nTherefore, it would have been
      obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of filing to apply the
      known technique of using user preference information to generate goods and number='14'services
      available (as disclosed by Delgado) to the known method and system for generating
      property that is available for purchase or use using user preference information
      (as disclosed by the combination of Visioli and Boys) to make recommendations
      reflecting a user\u2019s interest that are represented at an attribute level.
      \ One of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to apply the known
      technique of using user preference information to generate goods and services
      available because it would make recommendations reflecting a user\u2019s interest
      that are represented at an attribute level (see Delgado: Col. 4 Line 8-31).
      \ \\nFurthermore, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the
      art at the time of filing to apply the known technique of using user preference
      information to generate goods and services available (as disclosed by Delgado)
      to the known method and system for generating property that is available for
      purchase or use using user preference information (as disclosed by the combination
      of Visioli and Boys) to make recommendations reflecting a user\u2019s interest
      that are represented at an attribute level, because the claimed invention is
      merely applying a known technique to a known method ready for improvement to
      yield predictable results.  See KSR Int\u2019l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S.
      398, 406 (2007).  In other words, all of the claimed elements were known in
      the prior art and one skilled in the art could have combined the elements as
      claimed by known methods with no change in their respective functions, and the
      combination would have yielded nothing more than predictable results to one
      of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention (i.e., predictable
      results are obtained by applying the known technique of using user preference
      information to generate goods and services available to the known method and
      system for generating property that is available for purchase or use using user
      preference information to make recommendations reflecting a user\u2019s interest
      that are represented at an attribute level).  See also MPEP \xA7 2143(I)(D).\\n
      number='15'Claims 4-5 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable
      over U.S. Patent No. 9104782 to Visioli et al. (hereinafter Visioli)  in view
      of U.S. Patent Application No. 20080065606 to Boys et al. (hereinafter Boys)
      in view of U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20150134483 to Barenblatt.
      \\nReferring to Claim 4, the combination of Visioli and Boys teaches the method
      of claim 2; The combination does not explicitly state wherein the user information
      includes financial information pertaining to the user. \\nBarenblatt, which
      talks about a method and system for identifying properties for a potential buyer,
      teaches it is known for a user to create a financial profile that includes financial
      information pertaining to the user in order to identify available properties
      that match the profile (see at least Barenblatt: \xB6 58, 60 and 75).\\nTherefore,
      it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of
      filing to apply the known technique of using financial information related to
      the user to identify properties that fit the profile (as disclosed by Barenblatt)
      to the known method and system for identifying a property for purchase by an
      image processing system (as disclosed by the combination of Visioli and Boys)

      to Claim 5, the combination of Visioli, Boys and Barenblatt teaches the method
      of claim 4; Barenblatt further teaches wherein the financial information includes

      of Pre-AIA  or AIA  Status\\nThe present application, filed on or after March
      16, 2013, is being examined under the first inventor to file provisions of the
      AIA .\\nStatus of Application\\nThis communication is a Non-Final response to
      the Application filed on the 30th day of October, 2015. Currently claims 1-20
      are pending. No claims are allowed.\\nInformation Disclosure Statement\\nThe
      information disclosure statement (IDS) submitted on 24th of March, 2016, was
      filed in compliance with the provisions of 37 CFR 1.97.  Accordingly, the information
      disclosure statement is being considered by the examiner.\\nClaim Rejections
      - 35 USC \xA7 101\\n35 U.S.C. 101 reads as follows:\\nWhoever invents or discovers
      any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter,
      or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject
      to the conditions and requirements of this title.\\n\\n\\nClaims 1-20 are rejected
      under 35 U.S.C. 101 because the claimed invention is directed to a judicial
      exception (i.e., a law of nature, a natural phenomenon, or an abstract idea)
      without significantly more.\\nWhen considering subject matter eligibility under
      35 U.S.C. \xA7 101, it must be determined whether the claim is directed to one
      of the four statutory categories of invention, i.e., process, machine, manufacture,
      or composition of matter. If the claim does fall within one of the statutory
      categories, it must then be determined whether the claim is directed to a judicial
      exception (i.e., law of nature, natural phenomenon, and abstract idea), and
      if so, it must additionally be determined whether the claim is a patent-eligible
      application of the exception. If an abstract idea  is present in the claim,
      any element or combination of elements in the claim must be sufficient to ensure
      that the claim amounts to significantly more than the abstract idea itself.
      Examples of abstract ideas include fundamental economic practices, certain methods
      of organizing human activities, an idea itself, and mathematical relationships/formulas.
      Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int. 7, 134 S. Ct. 2347 (2014).\\nIn the instant
      case, claims 1-20 are directed to a method, device and system. Claims 1 and
      16-18 are directed to substantially similar subject matter and are therefore
      addressed collectively below in the analysis of Claim 1. Thus, the claimed invention
      is directed towards one of the four statutory categories under 35 USC \xA7 101.
      Nevertheless, the claims also fall within the judicial exception of an abstract
      idea. \\nUnder the test defined in Alice and Mayo, the first step is to identify
      whether the claims are directed toward a judicial exception such as an abstract
      idea. The examiner considers the abstract idea of the claim 1 to be \u201Can
      abstract idea of itself\u201D. The phrase \\\"an idea of itself\\\" is used
      to describe an idea standing alone such as a un-instantiated concept, plan or
      scheme, as well as a mental process (thinking) that \\\"can be performed in
      the human mind, or by a human using a pen and paper. Some concepts that are
      idea can also fall within other categories. For example, in Ultramercial, the
      steps of displaying an advertisement in exchange for access to copyrighted media
      was called an \\\"idea\\\", but could also be considered human activity because
      the claim describes advertising. Several cases have found concepts relating
      to processing and organizing information that can be performed mentally abstract,
      such as collecting data (receiving one or more images from a user device, wherein
      the one or more images are images of properties, and wherein the user device
      one or more of captures, selects, and stores the one or more images), recognizing
      certain data within the collected data set (identifying (recognizing) one or
      more  property attributes within the one or more images; generating image data
      (recognizing certain data), the image data including the one or more images
      and the one or more property attributes; extracting (recognizing certain data)
      user preference information directly from the image data, the user preference
      information including one or more preferred aesthetic property attributes; searching
      (recognizing certain data within the database) an available property database
      using the user preference information; receiving available property information
      from the available property database that matches the user preference information
      (recognizing certain data), the available property information including information
      relating to one or more properties that are available for purchase) and storing
      that recognized data in a memory found in Content Extraction to be abstract.
      Content Extraction & Transmission v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.\xB8776 F.3d 1343
      (Fed. Cir. 2014). These functions collectively are considered to recite an abstract
      idea in that the claimed limitations are similar to cases holding that using
      categories to collecting data, recognizing certain data within the collected
      data set and storing that recognized data in a memory recite \\\"an idea of
      itself\\\". (See July 2015 Update: Subject Matter Eligibility page 5 citing
      Content Extraction as holding concepts relating to collecting data, recognizing
      certain data within the collected data set and storing that recognized data
      in a memory as an abstract idea). The remaining limitation is directed to generic
      computer functions such as display of data which does not render the claims
      patentable subject matter. The claimed subject matter is similar to that of
      the abstract in Content Extraction in that the claimed invention merely receives
      images, extracts information from the images such as attributes and user preferences.
      This is substantially similar to the abstract idea found in Content Extraction.
      Therefore, the claims are directed to an abstract idea.\\n Alternatively, Examiner
      refers Applicant to the recently decided Electric Power Group v. Alstom case
      (2015-1778 Fed. Cir. decided August 1, 2016). In that case, the Federal Circuit
      held that claims directed toward receiving data, analyzing data and display
      of the analysis of the data, including concurrent visualizations of different
      analyses, was held to recite an abstract idea of itself because it recited mental
      processes (see slip opinion at pages 3-8). In the instant application, Claim
      1 is directed to a method for identifying a property for purchase by an image
      processing system comprising receiving one or more images from a user device,
      wherein the one or more images are images of properties, and wherein the user
      device one or more of captures, selects, and stores the one or more images (receiving
      and storing information); identifying one or more property attributes within
      the one or more images (analyzing the information such as the images); generating
      image data, the image data including the one or more images and the one or more
      property attributes (analyzing the information related to the images); extracting
      user preference information directly from the image data, the user preference
      information including one or more preferred aesthetic property attributes (analyzing
      the information contained in the images); searching an available property database
      using the user preference information (analyzing information related to the
      property database); receiving available property information from the available
      property database that matches the user preference information, the available
      property information including information relating to one or more properties
      that are available for purchase (analyzing information related to the property
      database); and presenting the available property information on a display (displaying
      the results of the analyzing of the property information).\\nApplying the test
      to the claims in the instant application, the additional elements in the claims
      (e.g., \u201Cmodules\u201D, \u201Cprocessor\u201D, \u201Cmemory\u201D), when
      taken alone or in combination do not  offer \u201Csignificantly more\u201D than
      the abstract idea itself. That is, the additional elements or combination of
      elements in the claim)s) other than the abstract idea per se amount to no more
      than: (i) mere instructions to implement the idea on a computer (i.e., take
      the abstract idea and apply it to a computer environment; here, a generic computers),
      and/or (ii) recitation of generic computer structure that serves to perform
      generic computer functions that are well-understood, routine, and conventional
      activities previously known to the pertinent industry (i.e., specification [3]:
      generically stating the invention is computer implemented). The claimed elements
      other than the abstract idea per se amount to no more than instructions to implement
      the abstract idea on computer devices such as a computer that performs generic
      computer functions that are well-understood, routine and conventional computer
      functions (See July 2015 Update: Subject Matter Eligibility page 7 stating that
      receiving, processing, storing, automating mental tasks, and receiving and transmitting
      data are well-understood, routine and conventional functions). The additional
      elements taken individually and also as a combination do not result in the claim
      as a whole amounting to significantly more.\\nWith respect to the dependent
      claims, they have been considered and are not found to be reciting anything
      that amounts to being significantly more than the abstract idea. Claim 2 is
      directed to further embellishments of collecting data and recognizing certain
      data within the collected data set, as well as analyzing information and displaying
      results of the data analysis which is a central themes of the abstract ideas.
      Claim 3 is directed to further embellishments of receiving and displaying information
      which is a central theme of the abstract idea. Claims 9 and 10 are directed
      to further embellishments of analyzing information which is a central theme
      of the abstract idea. Claims 11 and 12 are directed to further embellishments
      of receiving information which is a central theme of the abstract idea. Claims
      4-8, 13-15 and 19-20 are  directed to a data description of the data used by
      the system which does not alter or effect the claims to amount to significantly
      more. Nothing is added to the function or structure of the claims that represents
      significantly more.\\nTherefore, since there are no limitations in the claim
      that transform the abstract idea into a patent eligible application such that
      the claim amounts to significantly more than the abstract idea itself, the claims
      are rejected under 35 U.S.C. \xA7 101 as being directed to non-statutory subject
      matter. See also 2014 Interim Guidance on Patent Subject Matter Eligibility
      (Federal Register, Vol. 79, No. 241, Tuesday December 16, 2014).\\n\\nClaim
      Rejections - 35 USC \xA7 103\\nIn the event the determination of the status
      of the application as subject to AIA  35 U.S.C. 102 and 103 (or as subject to
      pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 102 and 103) is incorrect, any correction of the statutory
      basis for the rejection will not be considered a new ground of rejection if
      the prior art relied upon, and the rationale supporting the rejection, would
      be the same under either status.  \\nThe following is a quotation of 35 U.S.C.
      103 which forms the basis for all obviousness rejections set forth in this Office
      action:\\nA patent for a claimed invention may not be obtained, notwithstanding
      that the claimed invention is not identically disclosed as set forth in section
      102, if the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art are
      such that the claimed invention as a whole would have been obvious before the
      effective filing date of the claimed invention to a person having ordinary skill
      in the art to which the claimed invention pertains. Patentability shall not
      be negated by the manner in which the invention was made.\\n\\nThe factual inquiries
      set forth in Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 148 USPQ 459 (1966), that
      are applied for establishing a background for determining obviousness under
      35 U.S.C. 103 are summarized as follows:\\n1. Determining the scope and contents
      of the prior art.\\n2. Ascertaining the differences between the prior art and
      the claims at issue.\\n 3. Resolving the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent
      art.\\n4. Considering objective evidence present in the application indicating
      obviousness or nonobviousness.\\nClaims 1-3 and 6-18 are rejected under 35 U.S.C.
      103 as being unpatentable over U.S. Patent No. 9104782 to Visioli et al. (hereinafter
      Visioli)  in view of U.S. Patent Application No. 20080065606 to Boys et al.
      (hereinafter Boys).\\nReferring to Claims 1 and 16-18 (substantially similar
      in scope and language), the combination of Visioli and Boys teaches a method,
      system and device for identifying a property for purchase by an image processing
      system, comprising: \\nVisioli discloses:\\nidentifying one or more property
      attributes within the one or more images.\\nSpecifically, Visioli discloses
      the system identifying various property attributes based on a selected image
      by the user (see at least Visioli: Col. 3 Line 27-52, Col. 4 Line 1-14, and
      Col. 4 Line 35-46).\\nVisioli further discloses:\\ngenerating image data, the
      image data including the one or more images and the one or more property attributes;
      and\\nextracting user preference information directly from the image data, the
      user preference information including one or more preferred aesthetic property
      attributes.\\nSpecifically, Visioli discloses the system generating and using
      the image data, such as various property attributes associated with the image,
      to extract user preference information from the image of the user\u2019s aesthetic
      property attributes that prefer (see at least Visioli: Col. 2 Line  55-67, Col.
      3 Line 27-52, Col. 4 Line 1-14, Col. 4 Line 35-67, Col. 5 Line 15-36, Col. 5
      Line 58-67, and Col. 6 Line 29-63).\\nVisioli further discloses: \\nsearching
      an available property database using the user preference information; \\nreceiving
      available property information from the available property database that matches
      the user preference information, the available property information including
      information relating to one or more properties that are available for purchase;
      and \\npresenting the available property information on a display.\\nSpecifically,
      Visioli discloses the system using the various preference information gained
      from the image data in searching the property database to receive information
      regarding available properties for purchase that match the preferences and presenting
      the properties to the user (see at least Visioli: Col. 1 Line 58-67, Col. 2
      Line 1-18, Col. 3 Line 15-40, Col. 3 Line 53-65, Col. 4 Line 1-14, Col. 4 Line
      35-46, Col. 4 Line 63-67, Col. 5 Line 1-57 and Col. 6 Line 47-63).\\nVisioli,
      while disclosing receiving image selections from users that are associated to
      various property attributes as well as the system storing the images, fails
      to state:\\nreceiving one or more images from a user device, wherein the one
      or more images are images of properties, and wherein the user device one or
      more of captures, selects, and stores the one or more images.\\n\\tBoys, which
      talks about using imagery data for search functions, teaches it is known for
      a user to input an image of a property and the system to search and present
      available properties that match the image and architecture of the property (Boys:
      \xB6 79).\\n Therefore, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill
      in the art at the time of filing to apply the known technique of receiving an
      image from the user of a piece of property in order for the system to return
      similar properties based on the image (as disclosed by Boys) to the known method
      and system for identifying a property for purchase using an image (as disclosed
      by Visioli) to enable images to be searched based on submitting an image or
      image data.  One of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to apply
      the known technique of receiving an image from the user of a piece of property
      in order for the system to return similar properties based on the image because
      it would enable images to be searched based on submitting an image or image
      data (see Boys: \xB6 8).  \\nFurthermore, it would have been obvious to one
      of ordinary skill in the art at the time of filing to apply the known technique
      of receiving an image from the user of a piece of property in order for the
      system to return similar properties based on the image (as disclosed by Boys)
      to the known method and system for identifying a property for purchase using
      an image (as disclosed by Visioli) to enable images to be searched based on
      submitting an image or image data, because the claimed invention is merely applying
      a known technique to a known method ready for improvement to yield predictable
      results.  See KSR Int\u2019l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 406 (2007).
      \ In other words, all of the claimed elements were known in the prior art and
      one skilled in the art could have combined the elements as claimed by known
      methods with no change in their respective functions, and the combination would
      have yielded nothing more than predictable results to one of ordinary skill
      in the art at the time of the invention (i.e., predictable results are obtained
      by applying the known technique of receiving an image from the user of a piece
      of property in order for the system to return similar properties based on the
      image to the known method and system for identifying a property for purchase
      using an image to enable number='10'images to be searched based on submitting
      an image or image data).  See also MPEP \xA7 2143(I)(D).\\nReferring to Claims
      16 and 17, the claims contain the additional limitations directed to a processor
      coupled to memory and a display; and. at least one of hardware and software
      modules within the memory and controlled or executed by the processor. Visioli
      additionally discloses the adequate structure such as a memory, a processor
      and a display (see at least Visioli: Col. 3 Line 4-26).\\n\\nReferring to Claim
      18, the claims contain additional limitations directed to a \u201Cthird party\u201D
      and the user of \u201Cinsight information\u201D which is disclosed by Visioli
      in the preference information that is discussed in the rejection and the third
      party information such as the MLS information (see at least: Visioli: Col. 3
      Line 4-14).\\n\\nReferring to Claim 2, the combination of Visioli and Boys teaches
      the method of claim 1; Visioli further discloses receiving user information
      from a customer database, the user information including information relating
      to a user; searching the available property database using the user preference
      information and the user information; and, receiving available property information
      from the available property data that matches the user preference information
      and the user information (see at least: Visioli: Col. 1 Line 58-67, Col. 2 Line

      information related to the users in a databased that is used to search available
      properties in order for the user to receive the results of the search).\\n\\nReferring
      to Claim 3, the combination of Visioli and Boys teaches the method of claim
      2; Visioli further discloses selecting a recommended property from the available
      property information and presenting information pertaining to the recommended

      combination of Visioli and Boys teaches the method of claim 18; The combination,
      while discloses a method and system for generating property that is available
      for purchase or use, fails to explicitly state wherein the product for purchase
      includes a service for purchase or use and wherein the one or more products
      available for purchase include one or more services available for purchase or
      use.\\nDelgado, which talks about obtaining user preferences and providing user
      based recommendations, teaches it is known to use user preference information
      in order to generate various goods and services related to the preferences (see
      at least Delgado: Abstract, Col. 2 Line 59-62, Col. 3 Line 55-60, Col. 4 Line

      available (as disclosed by Delgado) to the known method and system for generating
      property that is available for purchase or use using user preference information

      yield predictable results.  See KSR Int\u2019l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S.
      398, 406 (2007).  In other words, all of the claimed elements were known in
      the prior art and one skilled in the art could have combined the elements as
      claimed by known methods with no change in their respective functions, and the
      combination would have yielded nothing more than predictable results to one
      of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention (i.e., predictable
      results are obtained by applying the known technique of using user preference

      The combination does not explicitly state wherein the user information includes
      financial information pertaining to the user. \\nBarenblatt, which talks about
      a method and system for identifying properties for a potential buyer, teaches
      it is known for a user to create a financial profile that includes financial

      that match the profile (see at least Barenblatt: \xB6 58, 60 and 75).\\nTherefore,
      it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of

      Ollis\\nFor Appellant\\n\\n\\nEXAMINER\u2019S ANSWER\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is
      in response to the appeal brief filed 01/18/2022.\\n(1) Grounds of Rejection
      to be Reviewed on Appeal\\nEvery ground of rejection set forth in the Office
      action dated 07/07/2021 from which the appeal is taken is being maintained by
      the examiner except for the grounds of rejection (if any) listed under the subheading
      \u201CWITHDRAWN REJECTIONS.\u201D  New grounds of rejection (if any) are provided
      under the subheading \u201CNEW GROUNDS OF REJECTION.\u201D\\n(2) Response to
      Argument\\nRegarding Claim 1:\\n\\tAppellant argues on Pages 8-9 of the Appeal
      Brief, that Van den Berg fails to teach at least three optical sensors in the
      measuring chamber and claiming that the Figure 1 of Van den Berg shows solids
      lines pointing to the four sensors in the milk line and a single dashed line
      to a single sensor in the milk glass therefore means that there is only a single
      sensor possible in the milk glass. Nowhere in the disclosure of Van den Berg
      are there definitions given to what the solid or dashed lines in Figure 1 represent
      or that the single dashed line shows that only one sensor can be in the milk
      glass. The Appellant is giving their own definition to the solid and dashed
      lines in the Figures which is not supported at all by the disclosure of Van
      den Berg.\\nAppellant also asserts that in Paragraph [0024] of Van den Berg,
      that it is a typo of Van den Berg is a typo on Van den Berg\u2019s part. Appellant
      states that when Van den Berg states \u201CIn other embodiments the sensors
      11 may also be disposed in the milk glass 11\u201D, in the milk, or in an overflow
      reservoir 14. The processing unit records these values measured by the sensor,\u201D
      that the plural form \u201Csensors\u201D is clearly a typo error and Van den
      Berg obviously meant to say the singular form of sensor. The examiner respectfully
      disagrees because this is an assumption by the Appellant that is not supported
      by the disclosure of Van den Berg. Note that just within Paragraph [0024] of
      Van den Berg, every other time sensors are referred to they are referred to
      in the plural form. For example, \u201Ca colour measuring system 9 comprising
      a processing unit 10 to which four colour sensors 11 are connected. These sensors
      11 are preferably disposed on the milk lines 2 of the individual teat cups 1.\u201D
      So, if there were to have been a typo in this paragraph [0024], it is a higher
      probability that the typo was using the singular \u201Csensor\u201D instead
      of the plural \u201Csensors.\u201D\\nAdditionally, the current claim language
      \u201Ca measuring chamber\u2026having a sensor system arranged therein or thereon\u201D
      does not require the sensor system to be therein the measuring chamber as being
      argued by the Appellant. Nowhere in the currently presented claim 1 does is
      there a limitation specifically requiring that the three or more optical sensors
      are located inside of the measuring chamber. Therefore, Van den Berg properly
      teaches the limitations of present claim 1 of the sensor system being located
      therein or thereon the measuring chamber.\\nAppellant then argues on Page 10
      that \u201Cthe Examiner uses improper hindsight for the motivation to rearrange
      the optical sensors of Van den Berg all into the milk glass.\u201D In response
      to Appellant's argument that the examiner's conclusion of obviousness is based
      upon improper hindsight reasoning, it must be recognized that any judgment on
      obviousness is in a sense necessarily a reconstruction based upon hindsight
      reasoning. But so long as it takes into account only knowledge which was within
      the level of ordinary skill at the time the claimed invention was made, and
      does not include knowledge gleaned only from the applicant's disclosure, such
      a reconstruction is proper.  See In re McLaughlin, 443 F.2d 1392, 170 USPQ 209
      (CCPA 1971). The Examiner clearly cites Paragraph [0024] of Van den Berg wherein
      Van den Berg explicitly states the possibility for alternate embodiments where
      the sensors can be located in the milk glass, in the milk, or in an overflow
      reservoir. This is not improper hindsight, Van den Berg clearly teaches this
      as a possible embodiment of his disclosed system. In the Advisory Action dated
      10/25/2021, the Examiner further elaborated that the alternate embodiment taught
      by Van den Berg Paragraph [0024] could be desirable for any number of reasons
      including the ability to take measurements at different locations in the milk
      glass or to provide the ability to take multiple measurements from different
      sensors to lower the chance of an incorrect sensor reading. This reasoning is
      well-known that when taking measurements utilizing sensors, that the more measurements
      taken results in a lower margin of error with the ability of weeding out the
      outlier measurements, therefore gathering more accurate measurements. This concept
      of gathering more data in order to achieve higher accuracy is well-known in
      the art and would be an obvious motivation.  \\nAppellant also argues on Pages
      10-11 that \u201Cthe sensor system is configured to using each of the at least
      three optical sensor devices when selected measure a local value of the property
      of the milk at a location of the selected optical sensor device\u2026this recitation
      is that each of the optical sensor devices should be used is also inconsistent
      with the suggestion that the additional sensors are present in case of an incorrect
      reading.\u201D Van den Berg does teach each of the optical sensors being selected
      to take a measurement (Paragraph [0016]; light sources of each optical sensors
      11 can be turned on and off to be selected to take a measurement) of a local
      value of the property of milk at the location where the sensor device is (Paragraph
      [0024]; sensors 11, 11\u2019, 11\u201D can all be selected to take measurements
      and are passed onto the computer 12). It is unclear how this teaching of each
      optical sensor being used is inconsistent with the suggestion that additional
      sensors are present in case of an incorrect reading, as Appellant tries to argue.
      It still remains true that the ability to take more measurements from more sensors
      results in a lower margin of error with the ability of weeding out the outlier
      measurements.\\nAppellant then argues on Page 11 that Van den Berg does not
      teach \u201Cmultiple sensors in a single location sending measurement information
      back to the processor.\u201D Firstly, this argument is directed towards something
      that is not claimed in the present claim 1. There is no language present in
      claim 1 that claims multiple sensors in a single location sending information
      back to the processor. However, Van den Berg does still teach this concept.
      Similarly, to as what was explained above, Van den Berg does teach a plurality
      of sensors in a single milk glass wherein the measurements taken by these sensors
      are sent back to a processor (Paragraph [0024]: processing unit 10 and computer
      12). Additionally, sending information from the sensors back to the processor
      is implied in a system like this. It would be unreasonable to have sensors taking
      measurements, but then not do anything with those measurements. It is implied
      that the measurements taken by the sensors are sent back to a processor to be
      recorded.\\nAppellant continues to argue on Page 11 that Van den Berg does not
      teach \u201Cdetermining the property value of the milk on the basis of the locally
      measured values locally by the three optical sensors.\u201D Van den Berg\u2019s
      sensors determine a property of milk, such as blood and fat content (Paragraph
      [0011] and claim 14), that are measured by each of the sensors 11. The Oxford
      definition of \u201Clocal: belonging or relating to a particular area or neighborhood.\u201D
      Any value measured by any one of the optical sensors in Van den Berg is a \u201Clocal\u201D
      value, as it is measuring the property of milk relating to the particular area
      in which the sensor is located. These sensors determine a property of milk in
      the \u201Clocal\u201D area that the sensors are located. Thus, Van den Berg
      does teach the claimed invention in claim 1.\\nAppellant then continues on Page
      11 arguing that \u201CVan den Berg teaches comparing measured values to those
      obtained earlier in time (rather than from other sensors in the system).\u201D
      This argument is directed towards a limitation that is not present in the claim.
      Claim 1 does not recite anywhere that the measured values from the sensors are
      compared to the measured values from the other sensors in the system; so arguing
      that Van den Berg teaches comparing measured values to values taken previously
      rather than from other sensors in the system is irrelevant.\\nRegarding Claims
      11 and 20:\\n\\tAppellant argues on Page 12 that it would not have been obvious
      to modify Van den Berg with the teachings of Ludwig. Appellant argues that because
      Ludwig teaches a measuring system that measures by means of conductance of electrodes
      and the measurements being taken are of a milk flow profile and not an optical
      property of the milk, that it wouldn\u2019t be obvious to combine with Van den
      Berg. Firstly, Ludwig teaches a milking system with a measuring chamber that
      utilizes a sensor system that measures a property of milk and records those
      measurements. A milking and milk measuring system utilizing sensors of Ludwig
      is analogous art to both Van den Berg and the present application; therefore,
      Ludwig would be an obvious system to modify Van den Berg with. Additionally,
      the Examiner did not use Ludwig for teaching of optical sensors and taking measurements
      with optical sensors; the Examiner solely relies on Ludwig to teach the type
      of connection between the milking cup and the measuring chamber. Secondly, measuring
      an \u201Coptical property of the milk\u201D is not what is presently claimed.
      Note that only measuring \u201Ca properly of the milk\u201D is claimed, which
      it is a broad limitation that a milk flow profile and a fill level, taught by
      Ludwig, would still fall under. Regardless, the Appellant is arguing a limitation
      that is not present in the claims. \\n\\tAppellant continues to argue on Pages
      12-13 that \u201Cincorporating the measuring chamber of Ludwig in the measuring
      system of Van den Berg would not result in the subject matter of claim 11\u2026because
      Ludwig has no optical sensors in the measuring chamber\u2026would still result
      in a system with a milk jar and individual milk lines from each teat to the
      milk jar, i.e., the location Van den Berg already proposes for placing his sensor
      device\u2026does not results in a rigidly connected measuring chamber.\u201D
      It should first be noted that the Oxford definition of the term \u201Crigid:
      unable to bend or be forced out of shape; not flexible,\u201D is a broad term.
      Arguably, Van den Berg can be interpreted to teach this limitation that the
      milk lines connecting the teat cups to the milk glass are unable to bend. However,
      by modifying reference Ludwig explicitly teaches a rigid connection (Paragraph
      [0024]). It appears the Appellant is arguing that the connection is a direct
      connection. However, a direct connection is not what is claimed in claims 11
      and 20; it is a rigid connection that is claimed. Direct has a completely different
      meaning than rigid as defined above, and therefore the prior art applied to
      claims 11 and 20 teaches the rigid limitation. \\nAdditionally, the Examiner
      never modified Van den Berg to incorporate the entire measuring chamber of Ludwig;
      the Examiner only modified the type of connection between the milking cup and
      the measuring chamber of Ludwig. So, the argument that Ludwig has no optical
      sensors in the measuring chamber is irrelevant to what the rejection actually
      was incorporating. Additionally, as stated above regarding claim 1, Van den
      Berg does teach locating the optical sensor devices within the milk jar (Paragraph
      [0024]). Furthermore, the Examiner utilized case law and a motivation to locate
      the optical sensors in the milk jar. \\n\\tAppellant further argues on Page
      13 that \u201CVan den Berg teaches only one sensor per teat per milk line\u2026Ludwig
      measuring chamber is only associated with a single teat\u2026Van den Berg offers
      no reason why there should be multiple sensors associated with a single teat.\u201D
      The rejection is only relying on the type of connection of the measuring chamber
      to the milking cup, so the single teat vs. multiple sensors argument proposed
      by Appellant is not what the rejection is relying on. Regardless, as stated
      just above and regarding claim 1, Van den Berg does teach multiple sensors in
      the milk jar (Paragraph [0024]) and not just one sensor associated with one
      teat. \\nFor the above reasons, it is believed that the rejections should be
      sustained.\\nRespectfully submitted,\\n/M.M./Examiner, Art Unit 3642                                                                                                                                                                                                        \\nConferees:\\n/SHADI

      are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 112(b) or 35 U.S.C. 112 (pre-AIA ), second paragraph,
      as being indefinite for failing to particularly point out and distinctly claim
      the subject matter which the inventor or a joint inventor (or for applications
      subject to pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 112, the applicant), regards as the invention.\\nRegarding
      claim 1, the term \u201Cthree-dimensional metal printing powder\u201D renders
      the claim indefinite as it is unclear if the composition is intended to require
      a metal powder or if the composition is merely limited to any powder capable
      of being printed as metal, i.e., metal compound powders. For the purpose of
      this examination, the three-dimensional metal printing powder will be interpreted
      as comprising a metal powder as is most consistent with the instant specification
      [0075-0084, 00117-00118]. \\n Claims 2 and 3 recite the limitation \\\"the organic
      additive\\\". There is insufficient antecedent basis for this limitation in
      the claims. For examination purposes, the organic additive will be interpreted
      to mean the organic polymeric additive as set forth in claim 1, and similarly
      recited in claims 4-14. \\nRegarding claim 11, the term \u201Ctotal surface
      loading\u201D renders the claim indefinite as it is unclear what is intended
      to be limited by the term, the specification does not provide a definition of
      the term, and it is not expected that one of ordinary skill in the art would
      be reasonably apprised of the meaning of the term. From the claim language,
      it is not clear whether the surface included in the term is referring to a surface
      of the polymeric additive or the metal printing powder.  It is further unclear
      if the loading is intended to indicate some area of coverage or merely a concentration
      of the additive. Considering the unit provided in the claim of \u201Cparts per
      hundred by weight\u201D it seems most appropriate to treat the total surface
      loading as the concentration of organic polymeric additive relative to the melting
      printing powder in the composition. \\nRegarding claim 12, the term \u201Ctrue
      bulk density\u201D renders the claim indefinite as it is unclear if the density
      intended is a true density based on powder volume excluding pores and voids
      or a bulk density based on a powder volume including pores and voids. The term
      is not further clarified or defined in the instant specification [0088]. For
      examination purposes, the density will be interpreted to mean a true density,
      as recited in the inventive examples [00117-00118]. \\nRegarding claim 13, the
      language of \u201Cthe surfactant has a minimum surface tension of less than
      about 45 mM/m\u201D renders the claim indefinite as an upper bound is indicated
      for a minimum surface tension such that it is unclear whether a minimum or maximum
      value is intended to be limited. \\nIn claims 13 and 14, the language of \u201Cthe
      surfactant comprises a member of a the group consisting of\u2026\u201D renders
      the claim indefinite as it is unclear whether or not the scope of the surfactant
      is intended to be open, or closed to only the subsequent list of alternatives;
      the language could read as \u201Cthe surfactant comprises a member selected
      from the group consisting of\u2026\u201D or \u201Cthe surfactant is selected
      from the group consisting of\u2026\u201D See MPEP 2111.03 and 2173.05(h). For
      the purpose of this examination, the surfactant will be interpreted as being
      open. \\n Claims 2-17 are rejected by virtue of their dependency on claim 1.

      AIA  Status\\nThe present application, filed on or after March 16, 2013, is
      being examined under the first inventor to file provisions of the AIA .\\n\\nElection/Restriction\\nRestriction
      to one of the following inventions is required under 35 U.S.C. 121:\\nI. Claims
      1-17, drawn to a composition of a three-dimensional metal printing powder, classified
      in B33Y 70/00.\\nII. Claims 18, drawn to a process for preparing a three-dimensional
      metal printing powder, classified in B22F 1/0062.\\nIII. Claims 19-20, drawn
      to a method for using a three-dimensional printing powder in a laser melting
      process, classified in B22F 10/20.\\nThe inventions are independent or distinct,
      each from the other because:\\nInventions I and II are related as process of
      making and product made.  The inventions are distinct if either or both of the
      following can be shown: (1) that the process as claimed can be used to make
      another and materially different product or (2) that the product as claimed
      can be made by another and materially different process (MPEP \xA7 806.05(f)).
      \ In the instant case the product as claimed can be made by another, materially
      different process, such as preparing the organic polymeric .\\nInventions I
      and III are related as product and process of use.  The inventions can be shown
      to be distinct if either or both of the following can be shown: (1) the process
      for using the product as claimed can be practiced with another materially different
      product or (2) the product as claimed can be used in a materially different
      process of using that product. See MPEP \xA7 806.05(h).  In the instant case
      the pro.\\nInventions II and III are related as combination and subcombination.
      \ Inventions in this relationship are distinct if it can be shown that (1) the
      combination as claimed does not require the particulars of the subcombination
      as claimed for patentability, and (2) that the subcombination has utility by
      itself or in other combinations (MPEP \xA7 806.05(c)).  In the instant case,
      the combination as claimed does not require the particulars of the subcombination
      as claimed because the process of making the powder composition of invention
      II does not require exposing the powder to a laser to fuse the powder.  The
      subcombination has separate utility such as using the powder composition in
      a selective laser melting process.\\nThe examiner has required restriction between
      combination and subcombination inventions. Where applicant elects a subcombination,
      and claims thereto are subsequently found allowable, any claim(s) depending
      from or otherwise requiring all the limitations of the allowable subcombination
      will be examined for patentability in accordance with 37 CFR 1.104.  See MPEP
      \xA7 821.04(a).  Applicant is advised that if any claim presented in a continuation
      or divisional application is anticipated by, or includes all the limitations
      of, a claim that is allowable in the present application, such claim may be
      subject to provisional statutory and/or nonstatutory double patenting rejections
      over the claims of the instant application. \\nRestriction for examination purposes
      as indicated is proper because all the inventions listed in this action are
      independent or distinct for the reasons given above and there would be a serious
      search and/or examination burden if restriction were not required because one
      or more of the following reasons apply:\\n\u2981 the inventions have acquired
      a separate status in the art in view of their different classification\\n\u2981
      the inventions have acquired a separate status in the art due to their recognized
      divergent subject matter\\n\u2981 the inventions require a different field of
      search (e.g., searching different classes/subclasses or electronic resources,
      or employing different search strategies or search queries).\\nApplicant is
      advised that the reply to this requirement to be complete must include (i) an
      election of a invention to be examined even though the requirement may be traversed
      (37 CFR 1.143) and (ii) identification of the claims encompassing the elected
      invention. \\nThe election of an invention may be made with or without traverse.
      To reserve a right to petition, the election must be made with traverse. If
      the reply does not distinctly and specifically point out supposed errors in
      the restriction requirement, the election shall be treated as an election without
      traverse. Traversal must be presented at the time of election in order to be
      considered timely. Failure to timely traverse the requirement will result in
      the loss of right to petition under 37 CFR 1.144. If claims are added after
      the election, applicant must indicate which of these claims are readable upon
      the elected invention.\\nShould applicant traverse on the ground that the inventions
      are not patentably distinct, applicant should submit evidence or identify such
      evidence now of record showing the inventions to be obvious variants or clearly
      admit on the record that this is the case. In either instance, if the examiner
      finds one of the inventions unpatentable over the prior art, the evidence or
      admission may be used in a rejection under 35 U.S.C. 103 or pre-AIA  35 U.S.C.
      103(a) of the other invention.\\nDuring a telephone conversation with Marylou
      Lavoie on 03/16/2021 a provisional election was made with traverse to prosecute
      the invention of Group I, claims 1-17.  Affirmation of this election must be
      made by applicant in replying to this Office action.  Claims 18-20 are withdrawn
      from further consideration by the examiner, 37 CFR 1.142(b), as being drawn
      to a non-elected invention.\\nApplicant is reminded that upon the cancellation
      of claims to a non-elected invention, the inventorship must be corrected in
      compliance with  37 CFR 1.48(a) if one or more of the currently named inventors
      is no longer an inventor of at least one claim remaining in the application.
      A request to correct inventorship under 37 CFR 1.48(a) must be accompanied by
      an application data sheet in accordance with 37 CFR 1.76 that identifies each
      inventor by his or her legal name and by the processing fee required under 37
      CFR 1.17(i).\\nThe examiner has required restriction between product or apparatus
      claims and process claims. Where applicant elects claims directed to the product/apparatus,
      and all product/apparatus claims are subsequently found allowable, withdrawn
      process claims that include all the limitations of the allowable product/apparatus
      claims should be considered for rejoinder. All claims directed to a nonelected
      process invention must include all the limitations of an allowable product/apparatus
      claim for that process invention to be rejoined. \\nIn the event of rejoinder,
      the requirement for restriction between the product/apparatus claims and the
      rejoined process claims will be withdrawn, and the rejoined process claims will
      be fully examined for patentability in accordance with 37 CFR 1.104. Thus, to
      be allowable, the rejoined claims must meet all criteria for patentability including
      the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 101, 102, 103 and 112. Until all claims to the
      elected product/apparatus are found allowable, an otherwise proper restriction
      requirement between product/apparatus claims and process claims may be maintained.
      Withdrawn process claims that are not commensurate in scope with an allowable
      product/apparatus claim will not be rejoined. See MPEP \xA7 821.04. Additionally,
      in order for rejoinder to occur, applicant is advised that the process claims
      should be amended during prosecution to require the limitations of the product/apparatus
      claims. Failure to do so may result in no rejoinder. Further, note that the
      prohibition against double patenting rejections of 35 U.S.C. 121 does not apply
      where the restriction requirement is withdrawn by the examiner before the patent
      issues. See MPEP \xA7 804.01.\\n\\nSpecification\\nThe disclosure is objected
      to because of the following informalities: \\nIn [0001-0005], the related applications
      are recited using only the attorney docket numbers; however, a cross-reference
      to a related application should be made using the patent application number
      or, where available, publication or patent number. See MPEP 608.01. \\nIn [0022],
      \\\"dimethyaminoethyl\\\" appears to contain a typographical error and is suggested
      to read \\\"dimethylaminoethyl\\\"\\nAppropriate correction is required.\\n\\nClaim
      Rejections - 35 USC \xA7 112\\nThe following is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 112(b):\\n(b)
      \ CONCLUSION.\u2014The specification shall conclude with one or more claims
      particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the
      inventor or a joint inventor regards as the invention.\\n\\n\\nThe following
      is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 112 (pre-AIA ), second paragraph:\\nThe specification
      shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly
      claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention.\\n\\n\\nClaims
      1-17 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 112(b) or 35 U.S.C. 112 (pre-AIA ), second
      paragraph, as being indefinite for failing to particularly point out and distinctly
      claim the subject matter which the inventor or a joint inventor (or for applications
      subject to pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 112, the applicant), regards as the invention.\\nRegarding
      claim 1, the term \u201Cthree-dimensional metal printing powder\u201D renders
      the claim indefinite as it is unclear if the composition is intended to require
      a metal powder or if the composition is merely limited to any powder capable
      of being printed as metal, i.e., metal compound powders. For the purpose of
      this examination, the three-dimensional metal printing powder will be interpreted
      as comprising a metal powder as is most consistent with the instant specification
      [0075-0084, 00117-00118]. \\nClaims 2 and 3 recite the limitation \\\"the organic
      additive\\\". There is insufficient antecedent basis for this limitation in
      the claims. For examination purposes, the organic additive will be interpreted
      to mean the organic polymeric additive as set forth in claim 1, and similarly
      recited in claims 4-14. \\nRegarding claim 11, the term \u201Ctotal surface
      loading\u201D renders the claim indefinite as it is unclear what is intended
      to be limited by the term, the specification does not provide a definition of
      the term, and it is not expected that one of ordinary skill in the art would
      be reasonably apprised of the meaning of the term. From the claim language,
      it is not clear whether the surface included in the term is referring to a surface
      of the polymeric additive or the metal printing powder.  It is further unclear
      if the loading is intended to indicate some area of coverage or merely a concentration
      of the additive. Considering the unit provided in the claim of \u201Cparts per
      hundred by weight\u201D it seems most appropriate to treat the total surface
      loading as the concentration of organic polymeric additive relative to the melting
      printing powder in the composition. \\nRegarding claim 12, the term \u201Ctrue
      bulk density\u201D renders the claim indefinite as it is unclear if the density
      intended is a true density based on powder volume excluding pores and voids
      or a bulk density based on a powder volume including pores and voids. The term
      is not further clarified or defined in the instant specification [0088]. For
      examination purposes, the density will be interpreted to mean a true density,
      as recited in the inventive examples [00117-00118]. \\nRegarding claim 13, the
      language of \u201Cthe surfactant has a minimum surface tension of less than
      about 45 mM/m\u201D renders the claim indefinite as an upper bound is indicated
      for a minimum surface tension such that it is unclear whether a minimum or maximum
      value is intended to be limited. \\nIn claims 13 and 14, the language of \u201Cthe
      surfactant comprises a member of a the group consisting of\u2026\u201D renders
      the claim indefinite as it is unclear whether or not the scope of the surfactant
      is intended to be open, or closed to only the subsequent list of alternatives;
      the language could read as \u201Cthe surfactant comprises a member selected
      from the group consisting of\u2026\u201D or \u201Cthe surfactant is selected
      from the group consisting of\u2026\u201D See MPEP 2111.03 and 2173.05(h). For
      the purpose of this examination, the surfactant will be interpreted as being
      open. \\nClaims 2-17 are rejected by virtue of their dependency on claim 1.
      \\n\\nClaim Rejections - 35 USC \xA7 102/103\\nIn the event the determination
      of the status of the application as subject to AIA  35 U.S.C. 102 and 103 (or
      as subject to pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 102 and 103) is incorrect, any correction of
      the statutory basis for the rejection will not be considered a new ground of
      rejection if the prior art relied upon, and the rationale supporting the rejection,
      would be the same under either status.  \\nThe following is a quotation of the
      appropriate paragraphs of 35 U.S.C. 102 that form the basis for the rejections
      under this section made in this Office action:\\nA person shall be entitled
      to a patent unless \u2013\\n\\n(a)(1) the claimed invention was patented, described
      in a printed publication, or in public use, on sale, or otherwise available
      to the public before the effective filing date of the claimed invention.\\n\\n\\n(a)(2)
      the claimed invention was described in a patent issued under section 151, or
      in an application for patent published or deemed published under section 122(b),
      in which the patent or application, as the case may be, names another inventor
      and was effectively filed before the effective filing date of the claimed invention.\\n\\n\\nClaims
      1, 3, and 8 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)/(a)(2) as being anticipated
      by Ng et al. (US 2017/0252974, hereinafter referred to as \\\"Ng\\\").\\nRegarding
      claims 1, 3, and 8, Ng teaches a build material including inorganic particles,
      each of which has a polymer attached onto the surface in the form of a continuous
      coating or as nano-beads [0013], and further teaches an example of the build
      material including acrylic latex polymer nano-beads coated on metal particles
      ([0029], Fig. 4). It is noted that the polymer of Ng would necessarily comprise
      at least one of a cross-linkable or non-cross linkable monomer. \\n\\nClaims
      12-14 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)/(a)(2) as anticipated by or, in
      the alternative, under 35 U.S.C. 103 as obvious over Ng et al. (US 2017/0252974,
      hereinafter referred to as \\\"Ng\\\") as applied to claim 1 above.\\nRegarding
      claim 12, Fig. 4 in Ng provides images of the build material where polymer nano-beads
      are coated onto metal particles [0029], Fig. 4 shows substantially all of the
      metal particle surface, nearing ~100%, to be covered by the nano-beads. Applicant
      has disclosed the formula in the instant claim 12 to be a general ideal formula
      for the coverage of spherical surface organic additive on a larger particle
      surface where a value of 0.2 indicates 0.2 of the surface is covered and a value
      of 1 indicates full coverage of the surface [00112-00114]. In considering that
      the build material of Ng exhibits a surface coverage of metal particles nearing
      100%, and is formed by a similar composition of metal microparticles and polymeric
      nanoparticles to the instant composition, the build material of Ng would be
      expected to meet or render obvious a value of the instant formula between 0.2-1.2.
      \\nRegarding claims 13-14, Ng teaches acrylic latex polymer nano-beads coating
      metal particles [0029], the latex polymer nano-beads of Ng are seen to anticipate
      or render obvious the latex particles of the instant claims. Although Ng is
      silent to the formation steps of the latex polymer in the example of [0029],
      even though product-by-process claims are limited by and defined by the process,
      determination of patentability is based on the product itself. The patentability
      of a product does not depend on its method of production. If the product in
      the product-by-process claim is the same as or obvious from a product of the
      prior art, the claim is unpatentable even though the prior product was made
      by a different process.\\\" In re Thorpe, 777 F.2d 695, 698, 227 USPQ 964, 966
      (Fed. Cir. 1985). See MPEP 2113. \\nAlternative to the aforementioned teachings,
      latex polymer particles of the instant claims are further seen to be rendered
      obvious in view of the disclosure of Ng as Ng teaches forming the polymeric
      material by carrying out emulsion polymerization [0026-0027] using suitable
      dispersants and surfactants, such as sodium dodecylsulfate [0054, 0056-0058].
      \\n\\nClaims 2, 9, 11, and 15-17 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable
      over Ng et al. (US 2017/0252974, hereinafter referred to as \\\"Ng\\\") as applied
      to claim 1 above.\\nRegarding claim 2, Ng teaches multiple acrylic monomers
      that can be selected for forming polymers or copolymers for coating the inorganic
      particles, including butyl acrylate (C7H12O2) and butyl methacrylate (C8H14O2)
      [0023], such that a polymer or copolymer with a first monomer having a carbon
      to oxygen ratio between 3-8 would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill
      in the art. \\nRegarding claim 9, Ng teaches the acrylic latex polymer nano-beads
      having an average diameter ranging from 3-1500 nm or 50-300 nm [0029]. Encompassing
      and overlapping ranges are prima facie obviousness. See MPEP 2144.05(I). \\nRegarding
      claim 11, Ng teaches that the polymer is present in the building material in
      an amount of about 1-5 wt% of the total weight percent of the inorganic particles
      [0020], providing ~1-5 pph by weight of the polymer relative to the weight of
      the metal particles, and rendering obvious the total surface loading of the
      instant claim. \\nRegarding claim 15, Ng teaches suitable metals for the inorganic
      particles including Ti, Al, Cr, Cu, Ni, Nb, Fe, and stainless steel [0021].
      \\nRegarding claim 16, Ng teaches suitable materials for the inorganic particles
      including mixtures of metal and ceramic particles [0021]. \\nRegarding claim
      17, Ng teaches suitable materials for the inorganic particles including mixtures
      of metal and metal oxide particles [0021]. A metal oxide particle is seen to
      meet the hybrid particle of the instant claim. \\n\\nClaims 1-3, 8, 11,  and
      15 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2) as being anticipated by Kasperchik
      et al. (US 2020/0398338, hereinafter referred to as \\\"Kasperchik\\\").\\nRegarding
      claims 1-3, 8, and 15, Kasperchik teaches a build material composition for 3D
      printing including flow additive nanoparticles mixed with host metal particles
      (Abstract), and further discloses and example of the build material wherein
      the host metal is stainless steel particles and the flow additive is a crosslinked
      organic particle flow additive formed by copolymerization of an isobornyl methacrylate
      (C14H22O2) and ethyl eneglycol dimethacrylate monomer mixture [0129-0130]. \\nRegarding
      claim 11, Kasperchik teaches the organic polymeric flow additive particle being
      included at 0.1 wt % of the build material [0134], providing about ~0.1 pph
      by weight of additive relative to the weight of the metal particles. \\n\\nClaim
      12 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2) as anticipated by or, in the alternative,
      under 35 U.S.C. 103 as obvious over Kasperchik et al. (US 2020/0398338, hereinafter
      referred to as \\\"Kasperchik\\\") as applied to claim 1 above.\\nRegarding
      claim 12, Kasperchik teaches an example of the build material with organic polymeric
      flow additive nanoparticles disposed on the surface of stainless steel host
      particles [0135-0136], and Fig.16 provides images of the build material, showing
      a majority (>50%) of the stainless steel microparticle surface to be covered
      with the additive nanoparticles. Applicant has disclosed the formula in the
      instant claim 12 to be a general ideal formula for the coverage of spherical
      surface additive on a larger particle surface where a value of 0.2 indicates
      0.2 of the surface is covered and a value of 1 indicates full coverage of the
      surface [00112-00114]. In considering that the build material of Kasperchik
      exhibits a surface coverage of metal particles between 50-100% and is formed
      by a similar composition of metal microparticles and polymeric nanoparticles
      to the instant composition, the build material of Kasperchik would be expected
      to meet or render obvious a value of the instant formula between 0.2-1.2.\\n\\nClaims
      4, 6-7, 9-10, and 13-14 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable
      over Kasperchik et al. (US 2020/0398338, hereinafter referred to as \\\"Kasperchik\\\")
      as applied to claim 1 above.\\nRegarding claim 4, Kasperchik teaches a polymerized,
      non-crosslinked organic material as being suitable for the flow additive nanoparticles
      [0038-0041]. \\nRegarding claim 6-7, Kasperchik teaches a heteropolymer as the
      organic additive, the heteropolymer including a hydrophilic component at 0.1-35%
      by weight of the heteropolymer [0038], with suitable hydrophilic monomers including
      cyanoacrylic acid (C4H3NO2) and acrylic acid [0040]. Overlapping ranges are
      prima facie obviousness. See MPEP 2144.05(I). \\nRegarding claim 9, Kasperchik
      teaches applying an additional binder material to the build material [0065],
      the binder being latex polymer particles having a size of 10-300 nm [0070-0072].
      Overlapping ranges are prima facie obviousness. See MPEP 2144.05(I).\\nRegarding
      claim 10, Kasperchik teaches the build material having polymeric flow additive
      nanoparticles of 5-200 nm in size [0041] and an additional binder material of
      latex polymer particles of 10-300 nm in size [0070-0072], such that a build
      material including two polymeric materials varying in median particle size by
      greater than 10 nm would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art.
      \\nRegarding claims 13-14, Kasperchik teaches applying an additional binder
      material to the build material [0065], the binder being latex polymer particles
      [0065-0067, 0070], and rendering obvious the latex particles of the instant
      claims. Even though product-by-process claims are limited by and defined by
      the process, determination of patentability is based on the product itself.
      The patentability of a product does not depend on its method of production.
      If the product in the product-by-process claim is the same as or obvious from
      a product of the prior art, the claim is unpatentable even though the prior
      product was made by a different process.\\\" In re Thorpe, 777 F.2d 695, 698,
      227 USPQ 964, 966 (Fed. Cir. 1985). See MPEP 2113. \\n\\nClaims 1, 3, and 15-17
      are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)/(a)(2) as being anticipated by Clare
      et al. (US 2016/0279703, hereinafter referred to as \\\"Clare\\\").\\nRegarding
      claims 1, 3, and 15-17, Clare teaches a powder of Ti-6-Al-4V particles and TiB2
      particles bound using a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) binder material [0074-0075],
      the TiB2 particles of Clare are seen to meet a non-metal powder and a hybrid
      particle of a metal and non-metal of the instant claims. It is noted that the
      PVA binder of Clare would necessarily comprise at least one of a cross-linkable
      or non-cross linkable monomer. \\n\\nClaims 1-3, 5-6, 8-9, 11, 13-14, and 15
      are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable over Vanbesien et al.
      (US 2012/0156605, hereinafter referred to as \\\"Vanbesien\\\").\\n\\tRegarding
      claims 1, 3, and 15, Vanbesien teaches a toner composition including toner particles
      mixed and contacting with carrier particles, wherein suitable carrier particles
      include steel and nickel [0117, 0127-0128], and the toner particles include
      a polymeric additive with a cross-linkable monomer [0009]. \\n\\tRegarding claim
      2, Vanbesien teaches a latex copolymer as the polymeric additive, the latex
      copolymer including a monomer having a C/O ratio from about 3-8 [0011], a monomer
      possessing two or more vinyl groups present in an amount of 0.1-20% by weight
      of the copolymer, and an amine-functional monomer present in amount of 0.1-40%
      by weight of the copolymer [0014]. Overlapping and encompassing ranges are prima
      facie obviousness. See MPEP 2144.05(I). \\nRegarding claim 5, Vanbesien teaches
      the copolymer including a cross-linking vinyl monomer of two or more vinyl groups
      present in an amount of 0.1-20% by weight of the copolymer [0009, 0014]. \\nRegarding
      claims 6 and 8, Vanbesien teaches the copolymer including a dimethylaminoethyl
      methacrylate (C7H13NO2) monomer in an amount of 0.1-40% by weight of the copolymer
      [0013-0014]. Overlapping ranges are prima facie obviousness. See MPEP 2144.05(I).\\nRegarding
      claim 9, Vanbesien teaches a particles of the latex copolymer having an average
      particle diameter of 70-250 nm [0011, 0032]. Overlapping ranges are prima facie
      obviousness. See 2144.05(I).\\nRegarding claim 11, Vanbesien teaches that an
      optional polymeric coating can be applied to the carrier particles having a
      coating weight of about 0.1-5% by weight of the carrier [0129], rendering obvious
      the total surface loading of the instant claim. \\nRegarding claims 13-14, Vanbesien
      teaches forming the latex copolymer by emulsion polymerization with at least
      one monomer and a surfactant [0009, 0018], and further discloses suitable anionic
      surfactants including sodium dodecylsulfate and sodium dodecylbenezene sulfonate
      [0019]. \\n\\nConclusion\\nThe prior art made of record and not relied upon
      is considered pertinent to applicant's disclosure:\\nUS 2020/0406351 and US

      previously cited).\\nRegarding claim 1, Kerprich teaches (see embodiment in
      fig 9) a polishing pad for polishing a substrate, the polishing pad comprising
      a polishing body (900) having a polishing surface (surface shown in figs) and
      a back surface (not shown), the polishing surface having a pattern of grooves
      comprising a plurality of discrete linear segments (904) orthogonal or approximately
      orthogonal to radii of the polishing surface (shown in fig 9), wherein the plurality
      of discrete linear segments orthogonal or approximately orthogonal to radii
      of the polishing surface form a portion of a, but not a complete concentric
      or approximately concentric polygon arrangement (fig 9; partial hexagons are
      formed by the grooves 904), and wherein the portion of the concentric or approximately
      concentric polygon arrangement omits one or more edges from one or more of the
      polygons (fig 9), and wherein the pattern of grooves has no radial groove (fig
      9; no grooves along radius). Kerprich does not explicitly teach the polygon
      is a dodecagon, but states that any number of secondary grooves can be formed
      ([0030]). Hosaka teaches a pattern of grooves wherein the grooves form a concentric
      polygon arrangement ([0046-0049]), wherein the number of sides of the polygon
      can be 4-64 ([0060], the second group creates the intersections in the polygons),
      encompassing the claimed shape. Known work in one field of endeavor may prompt
      variations (in this case change in shape) for use in either the same field or
      a different one based on design incentives or other market forces if the variations,
      dependent on work-piece parameters, are predictable to one of ordinary skill
      in the art, since it has been held that changing shape, dependent on work-piece
      parameters, involves  only routine skill in the art. In this case, it would
      have been obvious for a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time
      of the invention to use a dodecagon for the polygonal shape in Kerprich, as
      the number and arrangement of grooves is known to have an effect on the ability
      of the pad to distribute and remove slurry to and from the workpiece, resulting
      in reducing the number of scratches on the workpiece as taught by Hosaka ([0139]).\\nRegarding
      claim 7, Kerprich teaches (embodiment of fig 9) a polishing pad for polishing
      a substrate, the polishing pad comprising a polishing body (900) having a polishing
      surface (surface shown in fig) and a back surface (not shown), the polishing
      surface having a pattern of grooves comprising nested incomplete polygons (formed
      by elements 904) having continuity there between (through grooves 903), wherein
      the pattern of grooves has no radial groove (fig 9; none of the grooves are
      along a radius). Kerprich does not explicitly teach the polygon is a dodecagon,
      but states that any number of secondary grooves can be formed ([0030]). Hosaka
      teaches a pattern of grooves wherein the grooves form a concentric polygon arrangement
      ([0046-0049]), wherein the number of sides of the polygon can be 4-64 ([0060],
      the second group creates the intersections in the polygons), encompassing the

      Kerprich et al (US 2009/0311955, previously cited) in view of Hosaka (US 2007/0082587,
      previously cited).\\nRegarding claim 1, Kerprich teaches (see embodiment in
      fig 9) a polishing pad for polishing a substrate, the polishing pad comprising
      a polishing body (900) having a polishing surface (surface shown in figs) and
      a back surface (not shown), the polishing surface having a pattern of grooves
      comprising a plurality of discrete linear segments (904) orthogonal or approximately
      orthogonal to radii of the polishing surface (shown in fig 9), wherein the plurality
      of discrete linear segments orthogonal or approximately orthogonal to radii
      of the polishing surface form a portion of a, but not a complete concentric
      or approximately concentric polygon arrangement (fig 9; partial hexagons are

      concentric polygon arrangement omits one or more edges from one or more of the

      9; no grooves along radius). Kerprich does not explicitly teach the polygon

      a substrate, the polishing pad comprising a polishing body (900) having a polishing
      surface (surface shown in fig) and a back surface (not shown), the polishing

      but states that any number of secondary grooves can be formed ([0030]). Hosaka
      teaches a pattern of grooves wherein the grooves form a concentric polygon arrangement
      ([0046-0049]), wherein the number of sides of the polygon can be 4-64 ([0060],
      the second group creates the intersections in the polygons), encompassing the

      of grooves is known to have an effect on the  ability of the pad to distribute
      and remove slurry to and from the workpiece, resulting in reducing the number
      of scratches on the workpiece as taught by Hosaka ([0139]).\\nResponse to Arguments\\nApplicant's
      arguments filed 22 May 2019 have been fully considered but they are not persuasive.
      Regarding claims 10-12, the newly cited Suzuki reference teaches the claimed
      subject matter as detailed above. Therefore arguments against the Nakahata reference
      are moot. Applicant further argues that the grooves 903 of Kerprich are radial
      grooves. Examiner respectfully disagrees. The grooves 903 of Kerprich, as broadly
      claimed, can be considered not radial, as they do not coincide with a radius
      of the pad. To further this point, applicant argues that the grooves 903 and
      1303 of Kerprich are the same. However, as clearly shown in figs 9 and 13, the
      grooves have different structures, 903 being not radial, and 1303 being radial.
      While these are both described as \\\"primary grooves\\\" in Kerprich, only
      grooves 1303 are radial. Applicant further argues that Hosaka does not teach
      a desirability of a dodecagon arrangement. However, Kerprich teaches that any
      number of grooves can be formed ([0030]), which suggests that a person having
      ordinary skill in the art would explore polygons having any number of sides.
      Hosaka explicitly suggests a number of ten sides by disclosing the range of
      4 to 65. Since grooves are known to be used to distribute slurry (Kerprich [0014]),
      it is obvious that the number and configuration of grooves can be optimized
      to provide optimal slurry distribution, improving polishing uniformity and minimizing
      defects. This is taught by Kerprich ([0014]) and Hosaka ([0139]). This renders
      a dodecagon obvious. Further, applicant has provided no showing of criticality
      to the claimed shape.  \\nApplicant argues that Hosaka teaches away from a lack
      of a radial groove. However, Kerprich teaches this limitation. Hosaka is provided
      only to show that the prior art suggests a dodecagon shape.\\nConclusion\\nThe
      prior art made of record and not relied upon is considered pertinent to applicant's
      disclosure. Other similar polishing pads are cited.\\nAny inquiry concerning

      device (Fig. 1-3, [0010]) comprising:  \\tan interactive display having a keyboard-enabled
      mode and a keyboard-disabled mode (Fig. 2, [0016-0017], disabling switch 66
      disables the physical keyboard 46), the interactive display comprising a first
      image display device disposed at a front surface of the electronic device (Fig.
      2, [0010, 0019], electronic device includes a first surface 18 on first front
      side 22 with a touch sensitive display 34) and a physical keypad disposed at

      the keyboard-disabled mode, the first image display device displays imaged keys
      and the physical keypad is disabled so that the physical keypad does not provide
      tactile feedback to a user (Fig. 1, [0010, 0016-0017], disabling the physical
      keypad which provides tactile feedback results in displaying the virtual keyboard),
      and  \\tin the keyboard-enabled mode, the first image display device does not
      display imaged keys and displays other image data, and the physical keypad provides
      tactile feedback to a user ([0010,0016-0017], virtual keyboard 38 disappears
      when virtual keyboard is disabled and physical keyboard 46 with tactile feedback
      is enabled as input mechanism). \\tRegarding claim 3, Gilmour teaches a second
      image display device disposed at the back surface (Fig. 3, [0011], second display
      58 disposed at second surface 26). \\tRegarding claim 4, Gilmour teaches the
      physical keypad disposed at the back surface comprises one or more physical
      keys that control activation of the imaged keys within the imaged keypad (Physical
      key 74 on physical keyboard 46 can be employed to toggle disablement of virtual

      side 22 and second surface 26 on second side 30. First and second sides are
      opposite from one another). \\tRegarding claim 15, Gilmour teaches the image
      display device is a liquid crystal  display ([0013], first display 24 is an
      LCD). \\tRegarding claim 16, Gilmour teaches the electronic device is selected
      from one of the following types of electronic devices: cell phones, personal
      digital assistants, gaming devices, and data input devices ([0001, 0021], cellular

      A1). \\tRegarding claim 5, Gilmour does not teach the physical keypad disposed
      at the back surface comprises one or more physical keys that perform a different
      function from the one or more imaged keys of the imaged keypad.  In an analogous
      art, Saila teaches the physical keypad disposed at the back surface comprises
      one or more physical keys that perform a different function from the one or
      more imaged keys of the imaged keypad ([0048], a shift key disposed on the back
      of the display performs a  modifying function that is different than the image
      keys on front of the display).  It would have been obvious to one skilled in
      the art, at the time of the invention, to modify  Gilmour with Saila to provide
      keys on the back side which perform different functions than keys on the front
      side as this minimizes the number of keys that need to be presented on the front
      side, which minimizes the required display area, resulting in a smaller electronic
      device.  \\t Regarding claim 6, Gilmour teaches a sensor that detects user interaction
      with the physical keypad disposed on the back surface; and an image generator
      that displays within the first image display device an imaged representation
      of the user interaction with the physical keypad disposed on the back surface

      from the physical keypad. In other words, the displaying of characters once
      a user hits a physical key on back of display provides an imaged representation
      of the user interaction).  Saila also teaches the claim limitations ([0012],
      when a keypad key on the backside is pressed, a corresponding symbol on the
      front side will be highlighted and will flash). \\tRegarding claim 7, Gilmour
      teaches a motion sensor ([0015-0017], measuring of acceleration to determine
      user inputs such are orientation change). Saila teaches the sensor comprises
      is a pressure sensor (Fig. 3, [0007, 0011, 0021-0022, 0030, 0034, 0047], physical
      keypad detects pressure).\\n Claim 8 is rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a)

      of the user interaction comprises an imaged depiction of the user's finger or
      thumb  interacting with the imaged keypad however, Linden teaches the imaged
      representation of the user interaction comprises an imaged depiction of the

      the first image display device displays imaged keys and the physical keypad
      is disabled so that the physical keypad does not provide tactile feedback to
      a user (Fig. 1, [0010, 0016-0017], disabling the physical keypad which provides

      between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such
      that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention
      was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject

      103(a) as being unpatentable over Gilmour (US 2011/0161809 A1) as applied to
      claim 1 above, and further in view of Saila (US 2006/0084482 A1). \\tRegarding
      claim 5, Gilmour does not teach the physical keypad disposed at the back surface
      comprises one or more physical keys that perform a different function from the
      one or more imaged keys of the imaged keypad.  In an analogous art, Saila teaches
      the physical keypad disposed at the back surface comprises one or more physical
      keys that perform a different function from the one or more imaged keys of the
      imaged keypad ([0048], a shift key disposed on the back of the display performs
      a  modifying function that is different than the image keys on front of the
      display).  It would have been obvious to one skilled in the art, at the time
      of the invention, to modify  Gilmour with Saila to provide keys on the back
      side which perform different functions than keys on the front side as this minimizes
      the number of keys that need to be presented on the front side, which minimizes
      the required display area, resulting in a smaller electronic device.  \\t Regarding
      claim 6, Gilmour teaches a sensor that detects user interaction with the physical
      keypad disposed on the back surface; and an image generator that displays within
      the first image display device an imaged representation of the user interaction
      with the physical keypad disposed on the back surface ([0010-0011], first data
      entry area 42 displays characters as they are entered from the physical keypad.
      In other words, the displaying of characters once a user hits a physical key
      on back of display provides an imaged representation of the user interaction).
      \ Saila also teaches the claim limitations ([0012], when a keypad key on the
      backside is pressed, a corresponding symbol on the front side will be highlighted
      and will flash). \\tRegarding claim 7, Gilmour teaches a motion sensor ([0015-0017],
      measuring of acceleration to determine user inputs such are orientation change).
      Saila teaches the sensor comprises is a pressure sensor (Fig. 3, [0007, 0011,
      0021-0022, 0030, 0034, 0047], physical keypad detects pressure).\\nClaim 8 is
      rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Gilmour
      (US 2011/0161809 A1) as applied to claim 6 above, and further in view of Saila
      (US 2006/0084482 A1) and Linden (US-2011/0021251 A1). \\tRegarding claim 8,
      Gilmour and Saila fail to teach the imaged representation of the user interaction
      comprises an imaged depiction of the user's finger or thumb  interacting with
      the imaged keypad however, Linden teaches the imaged representation of the user
      interaction comprises an imaged depiction of the user's finger or thumb interacting
      with the imaged keypad (Fig. 3, 7, and 8, [0059], the user's finger(s) may be
      visible through the display screen). It would have been obvious to one skilled
      in the art, at the time of the invention, to modify the teachings of Gilmour
      and Saila with Linden to allow the user to view his or her fingers interacting
      with a touch-sensitive input device on a back side of the mobile phone as it
      may significantly enhance a user's experience (Linden, [0059]). \\nClaims 10,
      12, 14 are rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over

      of Saila (US 2006/0084482 A1) and Fyke (2008/0303796 A1).    \\tRegarding claim
      10, Gilmour and Saila do not teach the front and back surfaces are angled relative
      to one another, however, Fyke teaches wherein the front and back surfaces are
      angled relative to one another (Fig. 3A and 3B, 224, 228, and 236 show surfaces
      angled in same manner as applicant\u2019s specification [0092] defines top surfaces
      of keypad being inclined).  It would have been obvious to one skilled in the
      art, at the time of the invention, to modify Gilmour and Saila with Fyke as
      Fyke provides shape changing keys which improve user tactile feedback interaction.
      \  \\tRegarding claim 12, Fyke teaches wherein the physical keypad comprises
      piezoelectric material ([0074], shape changing upper surface layer 208, [0076],
      electro active polymers include materials that exhibit piezoelectric).  \\tRegarding
      claim 14, Fyke teaches the physical keypad comprises magnetostrictive material
      ([0076], magnetically activated solids).\\nClaim 13 is rejected under pre-AIA
      \ 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Gilmour (US 2011/0161809 A1) as
      applied to claim 6 above, and further in view of Saila (US 2006/0084482 A1),
      Fyke (2008/0303796 A1), and Feldmann et al. (US-4,654,715 A, hereinafter, Feldmann).
      \ \\t Regarding claim 13, Gilmour, Saila and Fyke do not explicitly teach wherein
      the piezoelectric material is quartz. Feldmann teaches this limitation. (col.
      3 line 2 -line 7). It would have been obvious to one skilled in the art to modify
      the inventions of Gilmour, Saila and Fyke with Feldmann such that the piezoelectric
      material is quartz so as to increase the efficiency and simplicity of the keypad.\\nResponse
      to Arguments\\nApplicant\u2019s arguments with respect to claims 1, 3-10, and
      12-16 have been considered but are moot in light of the new rejection.\\nConclusion\\nApplicant's
      amendment necessitated the new ground(s) of rejection presented in this Office
      action.  Accordingly, THIS ACTION IS MADE FINAL.  See MPEP \xA7 706.07(a).  Applicant
      is reminded of the extension of time policy as set forth in 37 CFR 1.136(a).
      \ \\nA shortened statutory period for reply to this final action is set to expire
      THREE MONTHS from the mailing date of this action.  In the event a first reply
      is filed within TWO MONTHS of the mailing date of this final action and the
      advisory action is not  mailed until after the end of the THREE-MONTH shortened
      statutory period, then the shortened statutory period will expire on the date
      the advisory action is mailed, and any extension fee pursuant to 37 CFR 1.136(a)
      will be calculated from the mailing date of the advisory action.  In no event,
      however, will the statutory period for reply expire later than SIX MONTHS from
      the date of this final action. \\nAny inquiry concerning this communication

      \ Status\\nThe present application, filed on or after March 16, 2013, is being
      examined under the first inventor to file provisions of the AIA .\\n\\nAllowable
      Subject Matter\\nClaims 1-16 are allowed. The following is an examiner's statement
      of reasons for allowance: The instantly claimed process is neither disclosed
      nor fairly suggested by the closest prior art: Seidel-Morgenstern et al (Chemical
      Engineering Technology, New Developments in Simulated Moving Bed Chromatography,
      2008, 31(6), pp. 826-837) and Yu et al (Industrial & Engineering Chemical Research,
      Modeling, Simulation, and Experimental Study of a Simulated Moving Bed Reactor
      for the Synthesis of Methyl Acetate Ester, 2003, 42, pp. 6743-6754). Yu teaches
      (Pg. 6743, Figure 1) a simulated moving bed reactor (SMBR) system and its use
      in the synthesis of methyl acetate by an esterification reaction between methanol
      and acetic acid: \\n    PNG    media_image1.png    365    418    media_image1.png
      \   Greyscale\\n Seidel-Morgenstern teaches (Pg. 829, Figure 4) a chromatographic
      process in which differing concentrations of starting material are fed into
      an SMB process as shown here:\\n    PNG    media_image2.png    299    494    media_image2.png
      \   Greyscale\\nYu and Seidel-Morgenstern, either alone or in combination, neither
      disclose nor fairly suggest conducting an esterification in an SMBR process
      in which varying ratios of reactants are fed to the process. Nor would one of
      ordinary skill in the art have been able to predict the instantly demonstrated
      (Specification, pg. 19:20 \u2013pg. 20:21) unexpected improvement in process
      efficiency obtained thereby.\\n\\nAny comments considered necessary by applicant
      must be submitted no later than the payment of the issue fee and, to avoid processing
      delays, should preferably accompany the issue fee.  Such submissions should
      be clearly labeled \\\"Comments on Statement of Reasons for Allowance.\\\"\\n\\nConclusion\\nAll
      questions pertaining to an application that has been allowed should be directed
      to the Office of Patent Publications Image Assistance Center at 888-786-0101.\\n\\n

      benefit for foreign priority under 35 U.S.C. \xA7 119(a)-(d) to EPO 09153097.2
      02/18/2009, is acknowledged. \\nStatus of Claims\\nClaims 1-13 are currently
      pending in the application.  \\nReceipt is acknowledged of amendment / response
      filed on November 29, 2011 and that has been entered. \\nClaims 1-13 [in-part,
      wherein R is a five membered heterocyclic group, Groups I and III] are withdrawn
      from further consideration pursuant to 37 C.F.R. 1.142 (b) as being drawn to
      a non-elected subject matter.\\nInformation Disclosure Statement\\nReceipt is
      acknowledged of Information Disclosure Statement (IDS), filed on 06/21/2010,
      which has been entered in the file.\\nResponse to Election/Restriction\\n\\t\\t\\nIn
      response to the restriction requirement, Applicants have elected Group II, which
      includes claims 1-12 drawn to a compound of the formula I [wherein R is a six
      membered heterocyclic group] and the elected species as set forth and found
      in Example 57 (Response, page 3), with traverse is acknowledged. Applicant\u2019s
      arguments (to withdraw restriction requirements) have been fully considered
      and found partially persuasive and therefore, Examiner has agreed to modify
      the restriction requirements to include and examine Group IV, claim 13 together
      with the  elected invention of Group II, because it commensurates within the
      scope of the elected invention. \\n\\t\\tHowever, the Examiner respectfully
      disagrees with the Applicant\u2019s other arguments at this time because the
      Invention groups I and III differ materially in structure and in element from
      each other and therefore, are capable of supporting their own patents. The invention
      groups I-IV are related to a set of structurally diverse and dissimilar compounds
      and their compositions (chemical structures, which are similar, are presumed
      to function similarly, whereas chemical structures that are not similar are
      not presumed to function similarly), which do not possess a substantial common
      core wherein a reference anticipating one would not necessarily render the other
      obvious and to search all the above groups in a single application would be
      an undue burden on the Examiner. Because of several classes and subclasses in
      each of the Group, a separate search considerations are involved, which would
      impose a serious burden on the Examiner to perform a complete search of the
      defined areas if unrestricted. Also, the fields of search are not coextensive.
      The wide disparity among the groups requires that many divergent fields must
      be searched, including all classes and subclasses of  and foreign patents as
      well as journals and publications. Moreover, the Examiner must perform a commercial
      database search on the subject matter of each group in addition to a paper search,
      which is quite burdensome to the Examiner. For these reasons, Applicant\u2019s
      arguments are found unpersuasive and, therefore, the requirement for restriction
      and election of species is still deemed proper.\\n\\t\\tApplicants preserve
      their right to file a divisional on the non-elected subject matter.\\n As set
      forth in the restriction requirement and an election of a single compound (or
      set of compounds), the invention will encompass all compounds that fall within
      the scope of the election / search is as follows:\\nA compound of the formula
      I wherein:\\nA is as claimed,\\n\\nR\u2019 is as claimed,\\n\\nAr is a six membered
      heteroaryl group,\\n\\nR is a six membered heterocyclic group, \\n\\nX1 is as
      claimed,\\n\\nX2 is as claimed,\\n\\nR1 is as claimed,\\n\\nR2 is as claimed,\\n\\nR3
      is as claimed,\\n\\nR4 is as claimed and all other variables are as defined.\\n\\nAs
      a result of the election and the corresponding scope of the compound identified,
      the remaining subject matter of claims 1-13  are withdrawn from further consideration
      pursuant to 37 CFR 1.142 (b) as being drawn to non-elected inventions. The withdrawn
      subject matter of claims 1-13 is properly restricted as it differs materially
      in structure and in element from the elected subject matter supra so as to be
      patentably distinct there from. \\nDouble Patenting\\nThe nonstatutory double
      patenting rejection is based on a judicially created doctrine grounded in public
      policy (a policy reflected in the statute) so as to prevent the unjustified
      or improper timewise extension of the \\\"right to exclude\\\" granted by a
      patent and to prevent possible harassment by multiple assignees.  See In re
      Goodman, 11 F.3d 1046, 29 USPQ2d 2010 (Fed. Cir. 1993); In re Longi, 759 F.2d
      887, 225 USPQ 645 (Fed. Cir. 1985); In re Van  Ornum, 686 F.2d 937, 214 USPQ
      761 (CCPA 1982); In re Vogel, 422 F.2d 438, 164 USPQ 619 (CCPA 1970);and, In
      re Thorington, 418 F.2d 528, 163 USPQ 644 (CCPA 1969).\\n\\nA timely filed terminal
      disclaimer in compliance with 37 CFR 1.321(c) may be used to overcome an actual
      or provisional rejection based on a nonstatutory double patenting ground provided
      the conflicting application or patent is shown to be commonly owned with this
      application.  See 37 CFR 1.130(b).\\n\\nEffective January 1, 1994, a registered
      attorney or agent of record may sign a terminal disclaimer.  A terminal disclaimer
      signed by the assignee must fully comply with 37 CFR 3.73(b).\\n\\nClaims 1-13
      are rejected under the judicially created doctrine of obviousness-type double
      patenting, as being unpatentable over claims 1-53 of US 8,022,099 (US \u2018099
      patent) and  if allowed, would improperly extend the \u201Cright to exclude\u201D
      already granted in the patent. \\nClaims 1-13 are rejected under the judicially
      created doctrine of obviousness-type double patenting, as being unpatentable
      over claims 1-7 of co-pending application No. 12/572,282 (US \u2018282). Although
      the conflicting claims are not identical, they are not patentably distinct from
      each other because all sets of claims are drawn to the same art recognized subject
      matter. This is a provisional obviousness-type double patenting rejection because
      the conflicting claims have not in fact been patented. A reference anticipating
      one set of claim will render the other obvious and it would have been obvious
      to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention was made since
      US \u2018099 patent or US \u2018282 co-pending application teach the generic
      compounds and compositions which are similar to the instantly claimed compounds.
      \\nThe subject matter claimed in the instant application is fully disclosed
      and covered in US \u2018099 patent or US \u2018282 co-pending application. Therefore,
      the disclosure of US \u2018099 patent or US \u2018282 co-pending application
      that teach many permutation and combinations (including various Markush variable
      substitutions, such as R1, R2, R3 and Ar etc.), which would easily place Applicant\u2019s
      invention in possession of the public at the time of Applicant\u2019s invention
      was filed.  The indiscriminate selection of \u201Csome'' among \u201Cmany''
      is prima facie obvious, In re Lemin, 141 USPQ 814 (1964). Therefore, in the
      instant case, one skilled in the chemical art would be motivated to choose to
      replace variable substitutions in permutation and combinations in core structure
      (including a bridging methylene group between the pyrrolidine ring and nitrogen
      atom) to obtain the desired products in view of the known teaching of the art.
      The claimed compounds are so closely related structurally to the homologous
      and /or analogous compounds of the reference as to be structurally obvious,
      therefore in the absence of any unobviousness or unexpected properties. Moreover,
      any other differences are but obvious structural modifications, which would
      be apparent to one skilled in the chemical art that can use similar substitutions,
      would expect to have the same or essentially the same results. Therefore, in
      looking at the instantly claimed invention as a whole, the claimed compounds
      and compositions would have been suggested to one skilled in the art and therefore,
      is obvious, absent evidence to the contrary.\\nObjections\\nClaims 1-13 are
      objected to for containing non-elected subject matter. The claims should be
      amended to exclude non-elected subject matter and within the scope of elected
      compound. \\nTelephone Inquiry\\n\\tAny inquiry concerning this communication

      \   Greyscale\\n \\n[AltContent: rect]\\n\\n The design in the 10/01/2018 drawing
      including features either added or removed as illustrated and described above
      is not present in the original drawings of the instant application. \\n\\nThe
      examiner notes that the original drawings were rendered using lines of the same
      thickness overall. In most of the examples above, examiner observes that applicant
      has taken some of the lines that were drawn as single thick lines and replaced
      them with several lines creating a complexity to the design that could not have
      been anticipated. To describe the edges of some of the planes of the article
      with several lines in some areas now changes the entire form of the design.
      Moreover, the removal of other lines creates uninterrupted planes further changing
      the design of the flower box. \\n\\nThere is nothing in the original disclosure
      to anticipate that the design of the 10/01/2018 drawings; therefore, the originally-filed
      drawings and specification do not support an understanding that applicant was
      in possession of the design now claimed.\\n\\n\u201CAdequate description of
      the invention guards against the inventor\u2019s overreaching by insisting that
      he recount his invention in such detail that his future claims can be determined
      to be encompassed within his original creation.\u201D  Vas-Cath, Inc. v. Mahurkar,
      935 F.2d 1555, 19 USPQ2d 1111 (Fed. Cir. 1991)\\n\\n(\u2018The [written description]
      inquiry is simply to determine whether the inventor had possession at the earlier
      date of what was claimed at the later date.\u2019).\u201D; In re Owens, 106
      USPQ2d 1248 (CAFC 2013).\\n\\nTherefore, The particular overall appearance of
      the design now claimed, is considered to be a change in configuration not supported
      by the original disclosure in the manner required by 35 USC 112(a). Applicant
      was not in possession of the design now claimed, as the design now claimed is
      not recognizable in the original design, to the exclusion of other designs,
      and as the design now claimed was not explicitly described in the earlier application
      papers nor was it described in the parent application. Note that applicant may
      make changes in the drawings in order to solve discrepancies pointed out by
      the examiner in an action but applicant may not change the design of the article.\\n\\n
      A response is required in reply to the Office action to avoid abandonment of
      the application. If corrected drawings are submitted in response to this Office
      action, they must be in compliance with 37 CFR 1.121(d).   When preparing new
      or replacement drawings, be careful to avoid introducing new matter. New matter
      is prohibited by 35 U.S.C. 132 and 37 CFR 1.121(f).\\n\\t\\nConclusion\\nTHIS
      ACTION IS MADE FINAL.  Applicant is reminded of the extension of time policy
      as set forth in 37 CFR 1.136(a).  \\n\\nA shortened statutory period for reply
      to this final action is set to expire THREE MONTHS from the mailing date of
      this action.  In the event a first reply is filed within TWO MONTHS of the mailing
      date of this final action and the advisory action is not mailed until after
      the end of the THREE-MONTH shortened statutory period, then the shortened statutory
      period will expire on the date the advisory action is mailed, and any extension
      fee pursuant to 37 CFR 1.136(a) will be calculated from the mailing date of
      the advisory action.  In no event, however, will the statutory period for reply
      expire later than SIX MONTHS from the mailing date of this final action. \\n\\nContact

      et al. (International patent application No.: US 5948819 A, issued September
      7, 1999, submitted by applicants as IDS dated 05/16/2014) in view of Hauser-Hahn
      (International patent application No.: WO 2009/000407, published December 31,
      2008). \\nIt should be noted that the equivalent US national stage application
      (US 2010/0184816, published July 22, 2010) of WO 2009/000407 is referenced for
      convenience because the original document is in foreign language.  \\nClaim
      1 of the instant application encompasses a plant fungal disease controlling
      composition comprising a compound of the formula (1) (referred to as \u201Camide
      compound\u201D by applicants) and one or more azole fungicidal compound selected
      from the following group consisting of triadimenol, bitertanol and hymexazol
      and etc. In addition, claim 1 of the instant application uses open-ended preamble
      \u201Ccomprising\u201D. Thus, it allows for the presence of additional components.\\nOhtsuka
      et al. is directed to an agricultural fungicide containing \uF061-substituted
      phenylacetic acid or amides (when Z is oxygen, Y is amino group, see Abstract
      and col. 1, lines 61-62). Ohtsuka et al. disclose formula (I) (structure showed
      below) as the generic structure (see col. 1).\\n    PNG    media_image1.png
      \   118    201    media_image1.png    Greyscale structure of Ohtsuka\u2019s
      formula (I).\\n Ohtsuka et al. further disclose hundreds of specific compounds
      (see Table from col. 43- 72), compound 74 (see col. 57-58) is the exact amide
      compound of the instant claim 1 (reds on formula 1, the limitation of the instant
      claim 1 and 4). Additionally, Ohtsuka et al. disclose a method for controlling
      phytopathogenic fungi which comprises applying a fungicidally effective amount
      of a compound or a salt thereof as an active ingredient to a locus where phytopathogenic
      fungi propagate or will propagate (see Ohtsuka\u2019s claim 20, reds on method,
      the limitation of the instant claim 4). Furthermore, Ohtsuka et al. disclose
      Application of the compound (I) may be made to plants by any conventional procedure
      such as atomizing, scattering or spreading of the active compound.  Application
      may also be made by treating with the active compound seeds of plants, soil
      where plants grow, soil for seeding, paddy field or water for perfusion.  Application
      may be performed before or after the infection with phytopathogenic fungi on
      plants (see col. 40, lines 47-55 reads on the limitation of the instant claim
      5). \\nWhile Ohtsuka et al. do not expressly disclose the combination of the
      amide compound with one or more azole fungicidal compound including triadimenol,
      bitertanol and hymexazol; the deficiency is cured by Hauser-Hahn.\\nHauser-Hahn
      is directed to novel compositions comprising certain triazole fungicides in
      combination with sulphosuccinates (Abstract). Hauser-Hahn discloses that the
      fungicidal combination comprises 1) a sulphosuccinate, and 2) one or mixture
      of triazole fungicides including triadimenol, bitertanol (page 1, para. [0048]),
      nucleic acid synthesis inhibitors: for example hymexazol (page 1, para. [0053],
      the limitations of the instant claims 1and 4). Hauser-Hahn state that the active
      compound combinations or compositions are used to increase the efficiency of
      the triazole fungicide (page 1, [0005]).  Additionally, Hauser-Hahn disclose
      that, in  the compositions, the weight of sulphosuccinate of the formula (I)
      is present per part by weight of triazole fungicide in general from 0.05 to
      10, preferably from 0.1 to 2, particularly preferably from 0.2 to 1 (see [0095],
      falling within the range of 0.0125/1 to 500/1, reads on the limitations of the
      instant claims 2 and 6) .\\nThe teachings of Ohtsuka et al. and Hauser-Hahn
      are each directed to fungicide agents.  It would have been prima facie obvious
      for one having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the instant invention
      to obtain a plant fungicidal disease controlling composition comprising the
      compound of formula 1 and with azole fungicides. One would have been motivated
      to combine the respective teaching of Ohtsuka et al. and Hauser-Hahn, because
      Ohtsuka et al. taught the amide compounds for controlling fungal disease in
      plants and soil; and Hauser-Hahn taught the benefit of combining two or more
      fungicides (e.g. increased efficacy and reduced phytotoxicity of azoles), as
      well as a method for controlling fungal disease in plants and soil as taught
      by Ohtsuka et al. The combination of these teachings would have been no more
      than a simple substitution of one known element for another to obtain predicable
      results, especially absent of evidence of the contrary(see MPEP \xA7 2143 Exemplary
      rationales that may support a conclusion of obviousness).  Furthermore, it is
      prima facie obvious to combine two compositions each of which is taught by the
      prior art to be useful for the same purpose, in order to form a third composition
      to be used for the very same purpose.... [T]he idea of combining them flows
      logically from their having been individually taught in the prior art.\u201D

      have been discussed as applied to claims 1-2 and 4-6. While Ohtsuka et al. and
      Hauser-Hahn do not expressly disclose the R-configuration of the amide (claim
      3 and 7); the deficiency is obviated by Soma.\\nSoma et al. disclose specific
      compounds of formula IIa (page 25, the R-isomer of the amide compound) and IIb
      (the racemate of the amide compound, page 25, the limitations of the instant
      claims 3 and 7). Additionally, Soma et al. disclose a method for controlling
      fungal plant disease, which comprises applying to a plant, a seed of a plant
      or a cropland (reads on soil) a mixture of the pyrazole with the amide compound
      (page 10, right column, the limitations of the instant claims 4 and 5). Soma
      et al. state synergistic effect is observed (see Table 1 on p.45).  \\nThe teachings
      of Ohtsuka et al., Hauser-Hahn, and Soma et al. are each directed to fungicide
      combinations. It would have been prima facie obvious for one having ordinary

      (sulphosuccinate) for another (R-configuration of the amide) to obtain predicable
      results, especially absent of evidence of the contrary(see MPEP \xA7 2143 Exemplary
      rationales that may support a conclusion of obviousness).  Furthermore, it is
      prima facie obvious to combine two compositions each of which is taught by the
      prior art to be useful for the same purpose, in order to form a third composition
      to be used for the very same purpose.... [T]he idea of combining them flows
      logically from their having been individually taught in the prior art.\u201D

      omitted) (see MPEP \xA7 2144.06). In conclusion, claims 1-2 and 4-6 are obvious
      under 35 U.S.C. 103 and are unpatentable.\\n\\nResponse to Arguments\\nApplicant\u2019s
      arguments have been considered to the extent that they might apply to the new
      grounds of rejection set forth above, but they are found unpersuasive. \\nIn
      response to applicant\u2019s argument (p. 7 of 9) that there is no teaching,
      suggestion, or motivation to combine the references, the examiner recognizes
      that obviousness may be established by combining or modifying the teachings
      of the prior art to produce the claimed invention where there is some teaching,
      suggestion, or motivation to do so found either in the references themselves
      or in the knowledge generally available to one of ordinary skill in the art.

      Teleflex, Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 82 USPQ2d 1385 (2007).  In this case, one would
      have been motivated to combine the respective  teaching of Ohtsuka et al., Hauser-Hahn,
      and Soma et al., because Ohtsuka et al. taught the amide compounds for controlling
      fungal disease in plants and soil; and Hauser-Hahn taught the benefit of combining
      two or more fungicides (e.g. increased efficacy), as taught by Soma et al. The
      combination of these teachings would have been no more than a simple substitution
      of one known element (sulphosuccinate) for another (R-configuration of the amide)
      to obtain predicable results, especially absent of evidence of the contrary(see
      MPEP \xA7 2143 Exemplary rationales that may support a conclusion of obviousness).

      3 and 7 are obvious under 35 U.S.C. 103 and are unpatentable.\\n\\nConsideration
      of Declaration under 37 CFR 1.132\\nThe declaration under 37 CFR 1.132 filed

      under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable over Takahashi et al. (hereinafter
      Takahashi, US 2006/0006692 A1) in view of Ludwig et al. (hereinafter Ludwig,
      US 7,960,932 B2).\\nFor claim 10, Takahashi discloses a method of controlling
      operation of a closure panel for a vehicle (Figs. 1 and 2 of Takahashi disclose
      a method of controlling operation of a closure panel 1 for a vehicle including
      a vehicle body 2 \u2013 see Takahashi, Fids. 1 and 2; and paragraph [0016])
      comprising:\\nraising the closure panel to an open position (Fig. 1 of Takahashi
      discloses raising the closure panel 1 to an open position \u2013 see Takahashi,
      Fig. 1 and paragraph [0016], lines 1-7);\\nmonitoring an encoder (Figs. 1 and
      2 of Takahashi disclose an encoder 4 \u2013 see Takahashi, paragraph [0016],
      lines 8-15) associated with a motor to detect the position of the closure panel
      (Figs. 1 and 2 of Takahashi disclose a drive controlling means 5 (or an Electronic
      control unit (ECU) 5) which  monitors an encoder 4 associated with a motor M
      to detect the position of the closure panel 1 \u2013 see Takahashi, Figs. 1-2,
      paragraphs [0016], lines 8-15; [0020] and [0044], lines 1-10) whenever the closure
      panel is open (Figs. 1-2 and Fig. 3, step S4 of Takahashi disclose ECU 5 which
      monitors an encoder 4 associated with a motor M to detect the position of the
      closure panel 1 whenever the closure panel 1 is open \u2013 see Takahashi, Figs.
      1-2, Fig. 3, step S4 and paragraphs [0020], lines 1-5 and [0023], lines 20-26);
      and \\nactuating a speed control system (Figs. 1-2 of Takahashi disclose the
      drive controlling means 5 which actuates a speed control system including a
      deceleration mechanism R and clutch C \u2013 see Takahashi, Figs. 1-2, paragraphs
      [0016]-[0017]).\\nTakahashi is silent for detecting rapid closing of the closure
      panel based upon a signal from the encoder. Furthermore, Takahashi discloses
      actuating a speed control system which is silent to prevent rapid closing of
      the closure panel.\\nHowever, Ludwig discloses detecting rapid closing of the
      closure panel based upon a signal from the encoder (the sole figure of Ludwig
      discloses the door closing process shown under the abscissa from right to left,
      wherein detecting rapid closing of the closure panel/door is shown as speed
      2 at VmaxCLOSE and based upon a signal from the encoder \u2013 see Ludwig, col.
      2, lines 39-43 and col. 3, lines 45-54). Furthermore, Takahashi discloses actuating
      a speed control system which is silent to prevent rapid closing of the closure
      panel (the sole figure of Ludwig discloses a speed control system including
      the opening speed of the door plotted above the abscissa and the closing speed
      of the door plotted under the abscissa, wherein Ludwig discloses actuating a
      speed control system to prevent rapid closing of the closure panel/door over
      the deceleration ramp 7 to a creeping movement D at the speed VminCLOSE \u2013

      Ludwig, US 7,960,932 B2), further in view of Bzorgi (US 2009/0084037 A1).\\nFor
      claim 11, Takahashi in view of Ludwig disclose all limitations as applied to
      claim 10 above. Takahashi in view of Ludwig disclose the step of actuating the
      speed control system (see previous explanation) which is silent for applying
      a brake. However, Bzorgi discloses the step of actuating the speed control system
      comprises applying a brake (see Bzorgi, Fig. 1 and paragraph [0023]. It is noted
      that \u201Cthe centrifugal clutch acts as a brake when the speed of the driven
      shaft is above a control-limit speed\u201D (emphasis added), on paragraph [0023],
      lines 5-6 of Bzorgi, implies applying a brake). Therefore, it would have been
      obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art before the effective filling date
      of the claimed invention to modify the teaching of Takahashi in view of Ludwig
      to incorporate the teaching of Bzorgi for purpose of preventing closure panel/gate
      crashing or other disorderly conduct.\\nFor claim 14 , Takahashi in view of
      Ludwig disclose all limitations as applied to claim 10 above. Takahashi in view
      of Ludwig disclose the step of actuating the speed control system which is silent
      for actuating a catch mechanism. However, Bzorgi discloses the step of actuating
      the speed control system comprises actuating a catch mechanism (Figs. 1 and
      3 of Bzorgi disclose actuating a catch mechanism 30 in the step of actuating
      the speed control system \u2013 see Bzorgi, Figs. 1, 3 and 4; and paragraphs
      [0025]-[0026] and [0030]). Therefore, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary
      skill in the art before the effective filling date of the claimed invention
      to modify the teaching of Takahashi in view of Ludwig to incorporate the teaching
      of Bzorgi for purpose of controlling described rotation direction.\\n Claims

      A1).\\nFor claim 12, Takahashi in view of Ludwig disclose the method of claim
      10 wherein the step of raising the closure panel further comprises:\\nactuating
      the motor of a power actuator that moves the closure panel (Fig. 1 of Takahashi
      discloses actuating the motor M of a power actuator 3 that moves the closure
      panel 1 \u2013 see Takahashi, Fig. 1, and abstract, lines 1-9).\\nTakahashi
      and Ludwig do not disclose: \\nmeasuring a level of current drawn by the motor;
      \\ncomparing the level of current to a predetermined level; and \\nraising the
      closure panel with the power actuator to the open position if the level of current
      is less than the predetermined level.\\nHowever, Ranaudo discloses:\\nmeasuring

      to modify the teaching of Takahashi in view of Ludwig to incorporate the teaching
      of Ranaudo for purpose of preventing damages of the motor due to overcurrent
      in the event a detected fault due to obstruction.\\nFor claim 13, Takahashi
      in view of Ludwig disclose the method of claim 10 wherein the step of raising
      the closure panel further comprises:\\nactuating the motor of a power actuator
      that moves the closure panel (Fig. 1 of Takahashi discloses actuating the motor
      M of a power actuator 3 that moves the closure panel 1 - see Takahashi, Fig.

      a level of current drawn by the motor; \\ncomparing the level of current to
      a predetermined level; \\nraising the closure panel to the open position;\\ndisabling
      the power actuator if the level exceeds the predetermined level; and \\nmanually
      operating the closure panel.\\nHowever, Ranaudo discloses:\\nmeasuring a level
      of current drawn by the motor (Fig. 3 of Ranaudo discloses s motor current feedback
      circuity 62 which measures a level of current drawn by the motor -- see Ranaudo,
      Fig. 3 and Fig. 6, step 114; and paragraphs [0023] and [0032], lines 1-3);\\ncomparing
      the level of current to a predetermined level (Fig. 6 of Ranaudo discloses comparing
      the level of current to a predetermined level - see Ranaudo, Fig. 6, step 116;
      and paragraphs [0023] and [0032], lines 1-3);\\nraising the closure panel to
      the open position (see Ranaudo, Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, steps 116, 122, 124, 126,
      128, 130; and paragraphs [0031], [0032] and [0034]);\\n disabling the power
      actuator if the level exceeds the predetermined level (Fig. 6 of Ranaudo discloses

      lines 1-10) whenever the closure panel is open (Figs. 1-2 and Fig. 3, step S4
      of Takahashi disclose ECU 5 which monitors an encoder 4 associated with a motor
      M to detect the position of the closure panel 1 whenever the closure panel 1
      is open \u2013 see Takahashi, Figs. 1-2, Fig. 3, step S4 and paragraphs [0020],
      lines 1-5 and [0023], lines 20-26); and \\nactuating a speed control system
      (Figs. 1-2 of Takahashi disclose the drive controlling means 5 which actuates
      a speed control system including a deceleration mechanism R and clutch C \u2013
      see Takahashi, Figs. 1-2, paragraphs [0016]-[0017]).\\nTakahashi is silent for
      detecting rapid closing of the closure panel based upon a signal from the encoder.
      Furthermore, Takahashi discloses actuating a speed control system which is silent
      to prevent rapid closing of the closure panel.\\nHowever, Ludwig discloses detecting
      rapid closing of the closure panel based upon a signal from the encoder (the
      sole figure of Ludwig discloses the door closing process shown under the abscissa
      from right to left, wherein detecting rapid closing of the closure panel/door
      is shown as speed 2 at VmaxCLOSE and based upon a signal from the encoder \u2013
      see Ludwig, col. 2, lines 39-43 and col. 3, lines 45-54). Furthermore, Takahashi
      discloses actuating a speed control system which is silent to prevent rapid
      closing of the closure panel (the sole figure of Ludwig discloses a speed control
      system including the opening speed of the door plotted above the abscissa and
      the closing speed of the door plotted under the abscissa, wherein Ludwig discloses
      actuating a speed control system to prevent rapid closing of the closure panel/door
      over the deceleration ramp 7 to a creeping movement D at the speed VminCLOSE
      \u2013 see Ludwig, col. 3, lines 45-58).\\n Therefore, it would have been obvious
      to one of ordinary skill in the art before the effective filling date of the
      claimed invention to modify the teaching of Takahashi to incorporate the teaching
      of Ludwig for purpose of preventing a sudden crash of the door.\\nClaims 11
      and 14 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable over Takahashi
      et al. (hereinafter Takahashi, US 2006/0006692 A1) in view of Ludwig et al.
      (hereinafter Ludwig, US 7,960,932 B2), further in view of Bzorgi (US 2009/0084037
      A1).\\nFor claim 11, Takahashi in view of Ludwig disclose all limitations as
      applied to claim 10 above. Takahashi in view of Ludwig disclose the step of
      actuating the speed control system (see previous explanation) which is silent
      for applying a brake. However, Bzorgi discloses the step of actuating the speed
      control system comprises applying a brake (see Bzorgi, Fig. 1 and paragraph
      [0023]. It is noted that \u201Cthe centrifugal clutch acts as a brake when the
      speed of the driven shaft is above a control-limit speed\u201D (emphasis added),
      on paragraph [0023], lines 5-6 of Bzorgi, implies applying a brake). Therefore,
      it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art before the effective
      filling date of the claimed invention to modify the teaching of Takahashi in
      view of Ludwig to incorporate the teaching of Bzorgi for purpose of preventing
      closure panel/gate crashing or other disorderly conduct.\\nFor claim 14 , Takahashi
      in view of Ludwig disclose all limitations as applied to claim 10 above. Takahashi
      in view of Ludwig disclose the step of actuating the speed control system which
      is silent for actuating a catch mechanism. However, Bzorgi discloses the step
      of actuating the speed control system comprises actuating a catch mechanism
      (Figs. 1 and 3 of Bzorgi disclose actuating a catch mechanism 30 in the step
      of actuating the speed control system \u2013 see Bzorgi, Figs. 1, 3 and 4; and
      paragraphs [0025]-[0026] and [0030]). Therefore, it would have been obvious
      to one of ordinary skill in the art before the effective filling date of the
      claimed invention to modify the teaching of Takahashi in view of Ludwig to incorporate
      the teaching of Bzorgi for purpose of controlling described rotation direction.\\nClaims

      et al. (hereinafter Takahashi, US 2006/0006692 A1) in view of Ludwig et al.
      (hereinafter Ludwig, US 7,960,932 B2), further in view of Ranaudo (US 2002/0104266
      A1).\\nFor claim 12, Takahashi in view of Ludwig disclose the method of claim
      10 wherein the step of raising the closure panel further comprises:\\nactuating
      the motor of a power actuator that moves the closure panel (Fig. 1 of Takahashi
      discloses actuating the motor M of a power actuator 3 that moves the closure
      panel 1 \u2013 see Takahashi, Fig. 1, and abstract, lines 1-9).\\nTakahashi
      and Ludwig do not disclose: \\nmeasuring a level of current drawn by the motor;
      \\ncomparing the level of current to a predetermined level; and \\nraising the
      closure panel with the power actuator to the open position if the level of current
      is less than the predetermined level.\\nHowever, Ranaudo discloses:\\nmeasuring
      a level of current drawn by the motor (Fig. 3 of Ranaudo discloses s motor current
      feedback circuity 62 which measures a level of current drawn by the motor --
      see Ranaudo, Fig. 3 and Fig. 6, step 114; and paragraphs [0023] and [0032],
      lines 1-3);\\ncomparing the level of current to a predetermined level (Fig.

      [0034] and [0043]).\\n Therefore, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary
      skill in the art before the effective filling date of the claimed invention
      to modify the teaching of Takahashi in view of Ludwig to incorporate the teaching
      of Ranaudo for purpose of preventing damages of the motor due to overcurrent
      in the event a detected fault due to obstruction.\\nFor claim 13, Takahashi
      in view of Ludwig disclose the method of claim 10 wherein the step of raising
      the closure panel further comprises:\\nactuating the motor of a power actuator
      that moves the closure panel (Fig. 1 of Takahashi discloses actuating the motor
      M of a power actuator 3 that moves the closure panel 1 - see Takahashi, Fig.
      1 and abstract, lines 1-9).\\nTakahashi and Ludwig do not disclose: \\nmeasuring
      a level of current drawn by the motor; \\ncomparing the level of current to
      a predetermined level; \\nraising the closure panel to the open position;\\ndisabling
      the power actuator if the level exceeds the predetermined level; and \\nmanually

      invention to modify the teaching of Takahashi in view of Ludwig to incorporate
      the teaching of Ranaudo for purpose of preventing damages of the motor due to
      overcurrent in the event a detected fault due to obstruction.\\nResponse to
      Arguments\\nApplicant's arguments filed 11/30/2018 with respect to claim 10
      have been fully considered but they are not persuasive. \\nApplicant\u2019s
      argument:\\nIn Remarks, page 4, lines 1-5, the applicant argues that \u201CAmended
      claim 10 clarifies that the method is effective whenever the closure panel is
      in the open position. Amended claim 10 is contrary to Ludwig which is not operational
      when the door is fully open and when no pulses are detected by the encoder.
      The Ludwig method is only effective to shut off the door drive and cannot stop
      a closure member from falling by actuating a speed control system to prevent
      rapid closing of the closure panel.\u201D (emphasis added).\\nExaminer\u2019s
      response:\\nIn response to applicant's argument, Takahashi discloses ECU 5 which
      monitors an encoder 4 associated with a motor M to detect the position of the
      closure panel 1 whenever the closure panel 1 is open \u2013 see Takahashi, Figs.
      1-2, Fig. 3, step S4 and paragraphs [0020], lines 1-5 and [0023], lines 20-26.\\n

      over US 2008/0042618 A1 (\u201CCromer\u201D) in view of US 4149649 (\u201CSzego\u201D).\\nRegarding
      claim 1, Cromer discloses a battery pack (254) (abstract; Fig. 5) comprising:\\nAt
      least one battery cell (262) including a first end defining a closed periphery,
      the cell including a second end defining a closed periphery, the first and second
      ends being spaced from each other and being parallel to each other but not being
      coplanar with each other, the cell including an enclosing wall connecting the
      ends and contiguous to the closed peripheries entirely around the closed peripheries
      (see Figs. 4, 5); and\\nAn outer casing (see Fig. 5) holding the cell.\\nCromer
      does not expressly disclose a mesh disposed along at least a portion of the
      enclosing wall to contain cell parts should the cell explode, the mesh being
      porous to gas emitted by the cell such that the gas can pass through the mesh
      to the casing.\\nSzego discloses an explosive-suppressive mass comprising layers
      of expanded metal of which each layer is arranged in a selected orientation
      so that its mesh strands are inclined with respect to the mesh strands of the
      layers adjacent thereto (abstract).   Szego further discloses a container, the
      interior of which is filled with a coiled segment of the expanded metal (Fig.
      5; col. 5, lines 7-14).  The filler masses may be trimmed to an appropriate
      size or shape for matching the interiors of the containers (col. 4, 67 \u2013
      col. 5, line 3).  The filler masses have the benefit of suppressing explosions
      (col. 1, lines 5-8).  Therefore, it would have been obvious to a person having
      ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to have incorporated
      the concept of an expanded metal filler as taught by Szego in the battery pack
      of Cromer to suppress explosions.  Cromer and Szego are related art as Cromer
      discloses battery short-circuits can cause the battery to overheat, causing
      risk of smoke and/or fire ([0003]).  Moreover, Cromer is interested in preventing
      cascade explosion (Fig. 5).\\nThus, in the combination above the mesh would
      be disposed along at least a portion of the enclosing wall.\\nRegarding claim
      8, modified Cromer discloses the battery of claim 1.  It is the examiner\u2019s
      opinion that \u201Cdisposed in a computer\u201D does not structurally limit
      the battery itself.  However, the battery pack of Cromer is disposed in a notebook
      computer ([0005]).\\nRegarding claim 10, Cromer discloses a battery pack (254)
      (abstract; Fig. 5) comprising:\\nA battery casing (Fig. 5) including a first
      end defining a closed periphery, a second end defining a closed periphery, and
      an enclosing wall connecting the ends and contiguous to the closed peripheries
      entirely around the closed peripheries, wherein the  first and second ends are
      spaced from each other and are parallel to each other but are not coplanar with
      each other (see Figs. 4, 5).\\nCromer does not expressly disclose a mesh overmolded
      or embedded onto at least part of the enclosing wall.\\nSzego discloses an explosive-suppressive
      mass comprising layers of expanded metal of which each layer is arranged in
      a selected orientation so that its mesh strands are inclined with respect to
      the mesh strands of the layers adjacent thereto (abstract).  Szego further discloses
      a container, the interior of which is filled with a coiled segment of the expanded
      metal (Fig. 5; col. 5, lines 7-14).  The filler masses may be trimmed to an
      appropriate size or shape for matching the interiors of the containers (col.
      4, 67 \u2013 col. 5, line 3).  The filler masses have the benefit of suppressing
      explosions (col. 1, lines 5-8).  Therefore, it would have been obvious to a
      person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to have
      incorporated the concept of an expanded metal filler as taught by Szego in the
      battery pack of Cromer to suppress explosions.  Cromer and Szego are related
      art as Cromer discloses battery short-circuits can cause the battery to overheat,
      causing risk of smoke and/or fire ([0003]).  Moreover, Cromer is interested
      in preventing cascade explosion (Fig. 5).\\nThe limitation \u201Covermolded\u201D
      is considered a product-by-process limitation.  In this regard, MPEP 2113 sets
      forth the following: \\\"[E]ven though product-by-process claims are limited
      by and defined by the process, determination of patentability is based on the
      product itself. The patentability of a product does not depend on its method
      of production. If the product in the product-by-process claim is the same as
      or obvious  from a product of the prior art, the claim is unpatentable even
      though the prior product was made by a different process.\\\" In re Thorpe,
      777 F.2d 695, 698, 227 USPQ 964, 966 (Fed. Cir. 1985).  The combination above
      does not appear to differ structurally from the instant claim.\\nRegarding claim
      11, modified Cromer discloses the battery of claim 10.  The mesh surrounds the
      battery cells, therefore, it is wrapped around the cells.\\nRegarding claim
      14, modified Cromer discloses the battery of claim 10.  The structural limitations
      of the instant claim appear to be met by the prior art.\\nRegarding claims 17
      and 18, Cromer discloses a battery pack and method of making comprising:\\nConstraining
      a cell (262) with structure (the container of the individual battery cells)
      in a battery casing (Fig. 5), wherein the battery casing includes a first end
      defining a closed periphery, a second end defining a closed periphery, and an
      enclosing wall connecting the ends and contiguous to the closed peripheries
      entirely around the closed peripheries, wherein the first and second ends are
      spaced from each other and are parallel to each other but are not coplanar with
      each other (see Figs. 4, 5).  The battery cell container is at least partially
      disposed along at least a portion of the enclosing wall.  A vent (303\u2019)
      is provided through the casing (Fig. 5, [0053]).\\nCromer does not disclose
      the cell is constrained within the casing in addition to a housing within the
      casing for the battery cell or the cell is constrained by a mesh.\\nSzego discloses
      an explosive-suppressive mass comprising layers of expanded metal of which each
      layer is arranged in a selected orientation so that its mesh strands  are inclined
      with respect to the mesh strands of the layers adjacent thereto (abstract).
      \ Szego further discloses a container, the interior of which is filled with
      a coiled segment of the expanded metal (Fig. 5; col. 5, lines 7-14).  The filler
      masses may be trimmed to an appropriate size or shape for matching the interiors
      of the containers (col. 4, 67 \u2013 col. 5, line 3).  The filler masses have
      the benefit of suppressing explosions (col. 1, lines 5-8).  Therefore, it would
      have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of
      the invention to have incorporated the concept of an expanded metal filler as
      taught by Szego in the battery pack of Cromer to suppress explosions.  Cromer
      and Szego are related art as Cromer discloses battery short-circuits can cause
      the battery to overheat, causing risk of smoke and/or fire ([0003]).  Moreover,
      Cromer is interested in preventing cascade explosion (Fig. 5).\\nRegarding claim
      32, modified Cromer discloses the battery of claim 1.  The mesh surrounds the
      cells and is therefore disposed along a portion of the enclosing walls.\\nRegarding
      claim 33, modified Cromer discloses the battery of claim 1.  As discussed above,
      the mesh completely surrounds the at least one cell.\\n Claims 2-4 and 15 are
      rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over US 2008/0042618
      A1 (\u201CCromer\u201D) in view of US 4149649 (\u201CSzego\u201D) as applied

      (US 2010/0047673 A1 used as an English translation). \\nRegarding claims 2-4
      and 15, modified Cromer discloses the battery of claims 1 and 10, but does not
      expressly disclose the casing has at least a first portion and a second portion,
      the first portion being structurally weaker than the second portion at least
      in part based on the first portion being thinner than the second portion to
      establish at least one pressure relief feature of the battery arranged to permit
      gas to pass through the casing when pressure in the casing exceeds a threshold
      or at least one pressure relief feature arranged to permit gas to pass through
      the casing when pressure in the casing exceeds a threshold wherein the pressure
      relief feature established by at least one pressure relief valve.\\nHirakawa
      discloses a battery pack having a risk of releasing a gas under abnormal conditions
      (abstract).  The case (2) comprises a pressure valve (5; Figs. 5A, 5B; [0038]-[0039]).
      \ The pressure valve is configured in such a manner that the opening (23) is
      clogged by the pressure-actuated valve (52) when the pressure-actuated valve
      is pressed against the opening by the pressure-actuated spring (53).  With this
      structure, it is possible to prevent air from flowing inside the case from the
      outside.  Therefore, it would have been obvious to a person having ordinary
      skill in the art at the time of the invention to have incorporated the valve
      of Hirakawa in the battery pack of modified Cromer to release gas from the battery
      pack while preventing air from flowing inside the case from the outside.  Regarding
      the thicknesses of claim 2, a portion the pressure-actuated valve (\u201Cthe
      second portion\u201D) is thicker than the spring (\u201Cthe first portion\u201D).
      \ The spring readily compresses and is deemed to be structurally weaker than
      the pressure-actuated valve.  This establishes the \u201Cpressure relief feature.\u201D

      as applied to claim 1 and 10 above, respectively, and further in view of JP
      2005-317455 A (\u201CToya\u201D).\\nRegarding claims 6 and 7, Cromer discloses
      the battery of claims 1 and 10, but does not expressly disclose at least one
      thermal barrier disposed between at least two adjacent cells.\\nToya teaches
      a battery pack (Fig. 2, 3) comprising batteries (1) separated by heat insulation
      spacers (2). The spacers reduce deterioration and prolong the life of the battery
      pack by reducing the temperature gradient across the battery pack (abstact).
      The insulating spacer comprises alumina (a ceramic) ([0024]).  It would have
      been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the
      invention to have incorporated the concept of an insulating spacer as taught
      by Toya to reduce deterioration and prolong the life of the battery pack.\\n
      Claim 9 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over US 2008/0042618

      US 2008/0196956 (\u201CKoenekamp\u201D).\\nRegarding claim 9, modified Cromer
      discloses the battery of claim 3, but does not expressly disclose the battery
      is disclosed in a motor vehicle wherein the pressure  relief feature is connected
      to an engine exhaust system of the motor vehicle, the exhaust system directing
      gas emerging from the pressure relief feature to an intended location.\\nKoenekamp
      discloses a fuel cell system for a hybrid vehicle that includes a high voltage
      battery, where the system uses a cathode exhaust gas airflow from a fuel cell
      stack to draw air through a battery compartment in which the battery is mounted
      to provide battery cooling (abstract; Fig. 1).  The system (10) includes a battery
      system (26) and a fuel cell stack (12) in fluid communication with a common
      pipe (32) (\u201Cthe engine exhaust system\u201D).  It would have been obvious
      to have modified the system of modified Dougherty by disposing the battery in
      a hybrid vehicle and fluidly connecting the battery with the exhaust system
      of the hybrid vehicle as taught by Koenekamp so that air is drawn through the
      battery compartment to cool the battery.\\n Claim 12 is rejected under pre-AIA
      \ 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over US 2008/0042618 A1 (\u201CCromer\u201D)

      further in view of US 5563364 (\u201CAlhamad\u201D).\\nRegarding claim 12, modified
      Cromer discloses the battery of claim 10, but does not expressly disclose the
      mesh is a glass fiber mat or carbon fiber mat.\\nAlhamad discloses a highly
      efficient anti-explosion pad comprising multiple sheets of expanded metal net
      separated by a core layer of porous material such as fiberglass (abstract).
      \ The porous nature of the pad enables them to disperse multidirectional forces
      of confined explosions while keeping effectiveness at deflecting number='10'lateral
      forces of unconfined explosions.  The structure also functions as a flame arrestor
      (col. 6, line 54 - col. 7, line 1).  Therefore, it would have been obvious to
      a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to have
      incorporated the concept of a fiberglass inner layer between two expanded metal
      layers in the battery of modified Cromer to disperse forces of explosions and
      suppress flames.\\n Claims 19, 21-24, 35, and 36 are rejected under pre-AIA

      as an English translation).\\nRegarding claim 19, Cromer discloses the method
      of claim 17 as discussed above and incorporated herein.  Cromer does not disclose
      the gas vent is provided by a pressure relief feature.\\nHirakawa discloses
      a battery pack having a risk of releasing a gas under abnormal conditions (abstract).
      \ The case (2) comprises a pressure valve (5; Figs. 5A, 5B; [0038]-[0039]).
      \ The pressure valve is configured in such a manner that the opening (23) is
      clogged by the pressure-actuated valve (52) when the pressure-actuated valve
      is pressed against the opening by the pressure-actuated spring (53).  With this
      structure, it is possible to prevent air from flowing inside the case from the
      outside.  Therefore, it would have been obvious to a person having ordinary
      skill in the art at the time of the invention to have incorporated the valve
      of Hirakawa in the battery pack of modified Cromer to release gas from the battery
      pack while preventing air from flowing inside the case from the outside.  Regarding
      the thicknesses of claim 2, a portion the pressure-number='11'actuated valve
      (\u201Cthe second portion\u201D) is thicker than the spring (\u201Cthe first
      portion\u201D).  This establishes the \u201Cpressure relief feature.\u201D  \\nRegarding
      claims 21, 23, and 24, Cromer discloses a battery pack comprising:\\nAt least
      two battery cells (Fig. 5; [0043]), each cell defined by opposed cell ends and
      at least one side extending between the cell ends and connecting the cell ends
      (Fig. 5);\\nAn outer casing (Fig. 5) holding the cells, the casing having opposing
      casing ends;\\nAt least one pressure relief feature (303') disposed along respective
      cell sides of each cell to permit gas to pass between the cells and through
      the casing.\\nCromer does not expressly disclose the pressure relief feature
      is a least partially disposed between the at least two battery cells such that
      the portion extends between respective cells sides or that the pressure relief
      feature permits gas to pass through the casing when pressure in the casing exceeds
      a threshold.\\nRegarding the positioning of the pressure relief feature, it
      has been held that if a claimed invention reads on the prior art except with
      regard to the position of a component of a device, the invention is unpatentable
      if switching the position of the component would have not modified the operation
      of the device. In re Japiksenumber='12', 181 F.2d 1019, 86 USPQ 70 (CCPA 1950).
      \ In this case, Cromer is concerned with efficiently exhausting any hot gases
      ([0048], [0053]), thereby providing motivation to rearrange the pressure relief
      feature.\\nHirakawa discloses a battery pack having a risk of releasing a gas
      under abnormal conditions (abstract).  The case (2) comprises a pressure valve
      (5; Figs. 5A, 5B; [0038]-[0039]).  The pressure valve is configured in such
      a manner that the opening (23) is clogged by the pressure-actuated valve (52)
      when the pressure-actuated valve is pressed against the opening by the pressure-actuated
      spring (53).  With this structure, it is possible to prevent air from flowing
      inside the case from the outside.  Therefore, it would have been obvious to
      a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to have
      incorporated the valve of Hirakawa in the battery pack of modified Cromer to
      release gas from the battery pack while preventing air from flowing inside the
      case from the outside.  Regarding the thicknesses of claim 2, a portion the
      pressure-actuated valve (\u201Cthe second portion\u201D) is thicker than the
      spring (\u201Cthe first portion\u201D).  This establishes the \u201Cpressure
      relief feature.\u201D  \\nRegarding claim 22, modified Cromer discloses the
      apparatus of claim 21.  A portion the pressure-actuated valve (\u201Cthe second
      portion\u201D) is thicker than the spring (\u201Cthe first portion\u201D).  The
      spring readily compresses and is deemed to be structurally weaker than the pressure-actuated
      valve.  \\nRegarding claims 35 and 36, modified Cromer discloses the apparatus
      of claim 21.  In an exemplary embodiment, Cromer shows six battery cells.  Air
      gaps (302, 303) extend between each of the cells and therefore the side surfaces
      of each of the cells.\\n Claim 20 is rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a)
      as being unpatentable over US 2008/0042618 A1 (\u201CCromer\u201D) in view of
      US 2008/0196956 (\u201CKoenekamp\u201D).number='13'\\nRegarding claim 20, Cromer
      discloses the method of claim 17 as discussed above and incorporated herein.
      \ Cromer does not disclose the vent is connected to an engine exhaust system
      of the motor vehicle, the exhaust system directing gas emerging from the pressure
      relief feature to an intended location\\nKoenekamp discloses a fuel cell system
      for a hybrid vehicle that includes a high voltage battery, where the system
      uses a cathode exhaust gas airflow from a fuel cell stack to draw air through
      a battery compartment in which the battery is mounted to provide battery cooling
      (abstract; Fig. 1).  The system (10) includes a battery system (26) and a fuel
      cell stack (12) in fluid communication with a common pipe (32) (\u201Cthe engine
      exhaust system\u201D).  It would have been obvious to have modified the system
      of modified Dougherty by disposing the battery in a hybrid vehicle and fluidly
      connecting the battery with the exhaust system of the hybrid vehicle as taught
      by Koenekamp so that air is drawn through the battery compartment to cool the
      battery.\\n Claims 25 and 34 are rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as

      in view of US 4149649 (\u201CSzego\u201D).\\nRegarding claim 25 and 34, modified
      Cromer discloses the apparatus of claim 21, but does not expressly disclose
      a mesh that is fire resistant.\\nSzego discloses an explosive-suppressive mass
      comprising layers of expanded metal of which each layer is arranged in a selected
      orientation so that its mesh strands are inclined with respect to the mesh strands
      of the layers adjacent thereto (abstract).  number='14'Szego further discloses
      a container, the interior of which is filled with a coiled segment of the expanded
      metal (Fig. 5; col. 5, lines 7-14).  The filler masses may be trimmed to an
      appropriate size or shape for matching the interiors of the containers (col.
      4, 67 \u2013 col. 5, line 3).  The filler masses have the benefit of suppressing
      explosions (col. 1, lines 5-8).  Therefore, it would have been obvious to a
      person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to have
      incorporated the concept of an expanded metal filler as taught by Szego in the
      battery pack of Cromer to suppress explosions.  Cromer and Szego are related
      art as Cromer discloses battery short-circuits can cause the battery to overheat,
      causing risk of smoke and/or fire ([0003]).  Moreover, Cromer is interested
      in preventing cascade explosion (Fig. 5).  Metal is deemed to be inherently
      fire resistant.\\n Claims 30 and 31 are rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a)

      of US 2003/0082439 A1 (\u201CSakakibara\u201D).\\nRegarding claims 30 and 31,
      modified Cromer discloses the battery of claim 1 and that the mesh surrounds
      the entire area of the enclosing wall but does not expressly disclose the battery
      comprises only one battery cell.\\nSakakibara discloses a battery pack (99;
      abstract).  Sakakibara further discloses it is well known in the art that battery
      cells may be connected in parallel and/or in series in order to provide the
      desired battery voltage and output current ([0005]).  As one would readily recognize
      from this, if the system for which one is designing requires the voltage and
      output current of only a single cell only a single cell would be used.  number='15'Therefore,
      it would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the

      as being unpatentable over US 2008/0042618 A1 (\u201CCromer\u201D) in view of
      US 4149649 (\u201CSzego\u201D).\\nRegarding claim 1, Cromer discloses a battery
      pack (254) (abstract; Fig. 5) comprising:\\nAt least one battery cell (262)
      including a first end defining a closed periphery, the cell including a second
      end defining a closed periphery, the first and second ends being spaced from
      each other and being parallel to each other but not being coplanar with each
      other, the cell including an enclosing wall connecting the ends and contiguous
      to the closed peripheries entirely around the closed peripheries (see Figs.
      4, 5); and\\nAn outer casing (see Fig. 5) holding the cell.\\nCromer does not
      expressly disclose a mesh disposed along at least a portion of the enclosing
      wall to contain cell parts should the cell explode, the mesh being porous to
      gas emitted by the cell such that the gas can pass through the mesh to the casing.\\nSzego
      discloses an explosive-suppressive mass comprising layers of expanded metal
      of which each layer is arranged in a selected orientation so that its mesh strands
      are inclined with respect to the mesh strands of the layers adjacent thereto
      (abstract).   Szego further discloses a container, the interior of which is
      filled with a coiled segment of the expanded metal (Fig. 5; col. 5, lines 7-14).
      \ The filler masses may be trimmed to an appropriate size or shape for matching
      the interiors of the containers (col. 4, 67 \u2013 col. 5, line 3).  The filler
      masses have the benefit of suppressing explosions (col. 1, lines 5-8).  Therefore,
      it would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the
      time of the invention to have incorporated the concept of an expanded metal
      filler as taught by Szego in the battery pack of Cromer to suppress explosions.
      \ Cromer and Szego are related art as Cromer discloses battery short-circuits
      can cause the battery to overheat, causing risk of smoke and/or fire ([0003]).
      \ Moreover, Cromer is interested in preventing cascade explosion (Fig. 5).\\nThus,
      in the combination above the mesh would be disposed along at least a portion
      of the enclosing wall.\\nRegarding claim 8, modified Cromer discloses the battery
      of claim 1.  It is the examiner\u2019s opinion that \u201Cdisposed in a computer\u201D
      does not structurally limit the battery itself.  However, the battery pack of
      Cromer is disposed in a notebook computer ([0005]).\\nRegarding claim 10, Cromer
      discloses a battery pack (254) (abstract; Fig. 5) comprising:\\nA battery casing
      (Fig. 5) including a first end defining a closed periphery, a second end defining
      a closed periphery, and an enclosing wall connecting the ends and contiguous
      to the closed peripheries entirely around the closed peripheries, wherein the
      \ first and second ends are spaced from each other and are parallel to each
      other but are not coplanar with each other (see Figs. 4, 5).\\nCromer does not
      expressly disclose a mesh overmolded or embedded onto at least part of the enclosing
      wall.\\nSzego discloses an explosive-suppressive mass comprising layers of expanded
      metal of which each layer is arranged in a selected orientation so that its
      mesh strands are inclined with respect to the mesh strands of the layers adjacent
      thereto (abstract).  Szego further discloses a container, the interior of which
      is filled with a coiled segment of the expanded metal (Fig. 5; col. 5, lines
      7-14).  The filler masses may be trimmed to an appropriate size or shape for
      matching the interiors of the containers (col. 4, 67 \u2013 col. 5, line 3).
      \ The filler masses have the benefit of suppressing explosions (col. 1, lines
      5-8).  Therefore, it would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill
      in the art at the time of the invention to have incorporated the concept of
      an expanded metal filler as taught by Szego in the battery pack of Cromer to
      suppress explosions.  Cromer and Szego are related art as Cromer discloses battery
      short-circuits can cause the battery to overheat, causing risk of smoke and/or
      fire ([0003]).  Moreover, Cromer is interested in preventing cascade explosion
      (Fig. 5).\\nThe limitation \u201Covermolded\u201D is considered a product-by-process
      limitation.  In this regard, MPEP 2113 sets forth the following: \\\"[E]ven
      though product-by-process claims are limited by and defined by the process,
      determination of patentability is based on the product itself. The patentability
      of a product does not depend on its method of production. If the product in
      the product-by-process claim is the same as or obvious  from a product of the
      prior art, the claim is unpatentable even though the prior product was made
      by a different process.\\\" In re Thorpe, 777 F.2d 695, 698, 227 USPQ 964, 966
      (Fed. Cir. 1985).  The combination above does not appear to differ structurally
      from the instant claim.\\nRegarding claim 11, modified Cromer discloses the
      battery of claim 10.  The mesh surrounds the battery cells, therefore, it is
      wrapped around the cells.\\nRegarding claim 14, modified Cromer discloses the
      battery of claim 10.  The structural limitations of the instant claim appear
      to be met by the prior art.\\nRegarding claims 17 and 18, Cromer discloses a
      battery pack and method of making comprising:\\nConstraining a cell (262) with
      structure (the container of the individual battery cells) in a battery casing
      (Fig. 5), wherein the battery casing includes a first end defining a closed
      periphery, a second end defining a closed periphery, and an enclosing wall connecting
      the ends and contiguous to the closed peripheries entirely around the closed
      peripheries, wherein the first and second ends are spaced from each other and
      are parallel to each other but are not coplanar with each other (see Figs. 4,
      5).  The battery cell container is at least partially disposed along at least
      a portion of the enclosing wall.  A vent (303\u2019) is provided through the
      casing (Fig. 5, [0053]).\\nCromer does not disclose the cell is constrained
      within the casing in addition to a housing within the casing for the battery
      cell or the cell is constrained by a mesh.\\nSzego discloses an explosive-suppressive
      mass comprising layers of expanded metal of which each layer is arranged in
      a selected orientation so that its mesh strands  are inclined with respect to
      the mesh strands of the layers adjacent thereto (abstract).  Szego further discloses
      a container, the interior of which is filled with a coiled segment of the expanded
      metal (Fig. 5; col. 5, lines 7-14).  The filler masses may be trimmed to an
      appropriate size or shape for matching the interiors of the containers (col.
      4, 67 \u2013 col. 5, line 3).  The filler masses have the benefit of suppressing
      explosions (col. 1, lines 5-8).  Therefore, it would have been obvious to a
      person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to have
      incorporated the concept of an expanded metal filler as taught by Szego in the
      battery pack of Cromer to suppress explosions.  Cromer and Szego are related
      art as Cromer discloses battery short-circuits can cause the battery to overheat,
      causing risk of smoke and/or fire ([0003]).  Moreover, Cromer is interested
      in preventing cascade explosion (Fig. 5).\\nRegarding claim 32, modified Cromer
      discloses the battery of claim 1.  The mesh surrounds the cells and is therefore
      disposed along a portion of the enclosing walls.\\nRegarding claim 33, modified
      Cromer discloses the battery of claim 1.  As discussed above, the mesh completely
      surrounds the at least one cell.\\n\\nClaims 2-4 and 15 are rejected under pre-AIA
      \ 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over US 2008/0042618 A1 (\u201CCromer\u201D)
      in view of US 4149649 (\u201CSzego\u201D) as applied to claim 1 above, and further
      in view of WO 2008/044430 A1 (\u201CHirakawa\u201D) (US 2010/0047673 A1 used
      as an English translation). \\nRegarding claims 2-4 and 15, modified Cromer
      discloses the battery of claims 1 and 10, but does not expressly disclose the
      casing has at least a first portion and a second portion, the first portion
      being structurally weaker than the second portion at least in part based on
      the first portion being thinner than the second portion to establish at least
      one pressure relief feature of the battery arranged to permit gas to pass through
      the casing when pressure in the casing exceeds a threshold or at least one pressure
      relief feature arranged to permit gas to pass through the casing when pressure
      in the casing exceeds a threshold wherein the pressure relief feature established
      by at least one pressure relief valve.\\nHirakawa discloses a battery pack having
      a risk of releasing a gas under abnormal conditions (abstract).  The case (2)
      comprises a pressure valve (5; Figs. 5A, 5B; [0038]-[0039]).  The pressure valve
      is configured in such a manner that the opening (23) is clogged by the pressure-actuated
      valve (52) when the pressure-actuated valve is pressed against the opening by
      the pressure-actuated spring (53).  With this structure, it is possible to prevent
      air from flowing inside the case from the outside.  Therefore, it would have
      been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the
      invention to have incorporated the valve of Hirakawa in the battery pack of
      modified Cromer to release gas from the battery pack while preventing air from
      flowing inside the case from the outside.  Regarding the thicknesses of claim
      2, a portion the pressure-actuated valve (\u201Cthe second portion\u201D) is
      thicker than the spring (\u201Cthe first portion\u201D).  The spring readily
      compresses and is deemed to be structurally weaker than the pressure-actuated
      valve.  This establishes the \u201Cpressure relief feature.\u201D  \\n\\nClaims
      6 and 7 are rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over

      as applied to claim 1 and 10 above, respectively, and further in view of JP
      2005-317455 A (\u201CToya\u201D).\\nRegarding claims 6 and 7, Cromer discloses
      the battery of claims 1 and 10, but does not expressly disclose at least one
      thermal barrier disposed between at least two adjacent cells.\\nToya teaches
      a battery pack (Fig. 2, 3) comprising batteries (1) separated by heat insulation
      spacers (2). The spacers reduce deterioration and prolong the life of the battery
      pack by reducing the temperature gradient across the battery pack (abstact).
      The insulating spacer comprises alumina (a ceramic) ([0024]).  It would have
      been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the
      invention to have incorporated the concept of an insulating spacer as taught
      by Toya to reduce deterioration and prolong the life of the battery pack.\\n\\nClaim
      9 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over US 2008/0042618

      US 2008/0196956 (\u201CKoenekamp\u201D).\\nRegarding claim 9, modified Cromer
      discloses the battery of claim 3, but does not expressly disclose the battery
      is disclosed in a motor vehicle wherein the pressure  relief feature is connected
      to an engine exhaust system of the motor vehicle, the exhaust system directing
      gas emerging from the pressure relief feature to an intended location.\\nKoenekamp
      discloses a fuel cell system for a hybrid vehicle that includes a high voltage
      battery, where the system uses a cathode exhaust gas airflow from a fuel cell
      stack to draw air through a battery compartment in which the battery is mounted
      to provide battery cooling (abstract; Fig. 1).  The system (10) includes a battery
      system (26) and a fuel cell stack (12) in fluid communication with a common
      pipe (32) (\u201Cthe engine exhaust system\u201D).  It would have been obvious
      to have modified the system of modified Dougherty by disposing the battery in
      a hybrid vehicle and fluidly connecting the battery with the exhaust system
      of the hybrid vehicle as taught by Koenekamp so that air is drawn through the
      battery compartment to cool the battery.\\n\\nClaim 12 is rejected under pre-AIA
      \ 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over US 2008/0042618 A1 (\u201CCromer\u201D)

      further in view of US 5563364 (\u201CAlhamad\u201D).\\nRegarding claim 12, modified
      Cromer discloses the battery of claim 10, but does not expressly disclose the
      mesh is a glass fiber mat or carbon fiber mat.\\nAlhamad discloses a highly
      efficient anti-explosion pad comprising multiple sheets of expanded metal net
      separated by a core layer of porous material such as fiberglass (abstract).
      \ The porous nature of the pad enables them to disperse multidirectional forces
      of confined explosions while keeping effectiveness at deflecting number='10'lateral
      forces of unconfined explosions.  The structure also functions as a flame arrestor
      (col. 6, line 54 - col. 7, line 1).  Therefore, it would have been obvious to
      a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to have
      incorporated the concept of a fiberglass inner layer between two expanded metal
      layers in the battery of modified Cromer to disperse forces of explosions and
      suppress flames.\\n\\nClaims 19, 21-24, 35, and 36 are rejected under pre-AIA
      \ 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over US 2008/0042618 A1 (\u201CCromer\u201D)

      as an English translation).\\nRegarding claim 19, Cromer discloses the method
      of claim 17 as discussed above and incorporated herein.  Cromer does not disclose
      the gas vent is provided by a pressure relief feature.\\nHirakawa discloses
      a battery pack having a risk of releasing a gas under abnormal conditions (abstract).
      \ The case (2) comprises a pressure valve (5; Figs. 5A, 5B; [0038]-[0039]).
      \ The pressure valve is configured in such a manner that the opening (23) is
      clogged by the pressure-actuated valve (52) when the pressure-actuated valve
      is pressed against the opening by the pressure-actuated spring (53).  With this
      structure, it is possible to prevent air from flowing inside the case from the
      outside.  Therefore, it would have been obvious to a person having ordinary
      skill in the art at the time of the invention to have incorporated the valve
      of Hirakawa in the battery pack of modified Cromer to release gas from the battery
      pack while preventing air from flowing inside the case from the outside.  Regarding
      the thicknesses of claim 2, a portion the pressure-number='11'actuated valve
      (\u201Cthe second portion\u201D) is thicker than the spring (\u201Cthe first
      portion\u201D).  This establishes the \u201Cpressure relief feature.\u201D  \\nRegarding
      claims 21, 23, and 24, Cromer discloses a battery pack comprising:\\nAt least
      two battery cells (Fig. 5; [0043]), each cell defined by opposed cell ends and
      at least one side extending between the cell ends and connecting the cell ends
      (Fig. 5);\\nAn outer casing (Fig. 5) holding the cells, the casing having opposing
      casing ends;\\nAt least one pressure relief feature (303') disposed along respective
      cell sides of each cell to permit gas to pass between the cells and through
      the casing.\\nCromer does not expressly disclose the pressure relief feature
      is a least partially disposed between the at least two battery cells such that
      the portion extends between respective cells sides or that the pressure relief
      feature permits gas to pass through the casing when pressure in the casing exceeds
      a threshold.\\nRegarding the positioning of the pressure relief feature, it
      has been held that if a claimed invention reads on the prior art except with
      regard to the position of a component of a device, the invention is unpatentable
      if switching the position of the component would have not modified the operation
      of the device. In re Japiksenumber='12', 181 F.2d 1019, 86 USPQ 70 (CCPA 1950).
      \ In this case, Cromer is concerned with efficiently exhausting any hot gases
      ([0048], [0053]), thereby providing motivation to rearrange the pressure relief
      feature.\\nHirakawa discloses a battery pack having a risk of releasing a gas
      under abnormal conditions (abstract).  The case (2) comprises a pressure valve
      (5; Figs. 5A, 5B; [0038]-[0039]).  The pressure valve is configured in such
      a manner that the opening (23) is clogged by the pressure-actuated valve (52)
      when the pressure-actuated valve is pressed against the opening by the pressure-actuated
      spring (53).  With this structure, it is possible to prevent air from flowing
      inside the case from the outside.  Therefore, it would have been obvious to
      a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to have
      incorporated the valve of Hirakawa in the battery pack of modified Cromer to
      release gas from the battery pack while preventing air from flowing inside the
      case from the outside.  Regarding the thicknesses of claim 2, a portion the
      pressure-actuated valve (\u201Cthe second portion\u201D) is thicker than the
      spring (\u201Cthe first portion\u201D).  This establishes the \u201Cpressure
      relief feature.\u201D  \\nRegarding claim 22, modified Cromer discloses the
      apparatus of claim 21.  A portion the pressure-actuated valve (\u201Cthe second
      portion\u201D) is thicker than the spring (\u201Cthe first portion\u201D).  The
      spring readily compresses and is deemed to be structurally weaker than the pressure-actuated
      valve.  \\nRegarding claims 35 and 36, modified Cromer discloses the apparatus
      of claim 21.  In an exemplary embodiment, Cromer shows six battery cells.  Air
      gaps (302, 303) extend between each of the cells and therefore the side surfaces
      of each of the cells.\\n\\nClaim 20 is rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a)
      as being unpatentable over US 2008/0042618 A1 (\u201CCromer\u201D) in view of
      US 2008/0196956 (\u201CKoenekamp\u201D).number='13'\\nRegarding claim 20, Cromer
      discloses the method of claim 17 as discussed above and incorporated herein.
      \ Cromer does not disclose the vent is connected to an engine exhaust system
      of the motor vehicle, the exhaust system directing gas emerging from the pressure
      relief feature to an intended location\\nKoenekamp discloses a fuel cell system
      for a hybrid vehicle that includes a high voltage battery, where the system
      uses a cathode exhaust gas airflow from a fuel cell stack to draw air through
      a battery compartment in which the battery is mounted to provide battery cooling
      (abstract; Fig. 1).  The system (10) includes a battery system (26) and a fuel
      cell stack (12) in fluid communication with a common pipe (32) (\u201Cthe engine
      exhaust system\u201D).  It would have been obvious to have modified the system
      of modified Dougherty by disposing the battery in a hybrid vehicle and fluidly
      connecting the battery with the exhaust system of the hybrid vehicle as taught
      by Koenekamp so that air is drawn through the battery compartment to cool the
      battery.\\n\\nClaims 25 and 34 are rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a)
      as being unpatentable over US 2008/0042618 A1 (\u201CCromer\u201D) in view of
      WO 2008/044430 A1 (\u201CHirakawa\u201D) as applied to claim 21 above, and further
      in view of US 4149649 (\u201CSzego\u201D).\\nRegarding claim 25 and 34, modified
      Cromer discloses the apparatus of claim 21, but does not expressly disclose
      a mesh that is fire resistant.\\nSzego discloses an explosive-suppressive mass
      comprising layers of expanded metal of which each layer is arranged in a selected
      orientation so that its mesh strands are inclined with respect to the mesh strands
      of the layers adjacent thereto (abstract).  number='14'Szego further discloses
      a container, the interior of which is filled with a coiled segment of the expanded
      metal (Fig. 5; col. 5, lines 7-14).  The filler masses may be trimmed to an
      appropriate size or shape for matching the interiors of the containers (col.
      4, 67 \u2013 col. 5, line 3).  The filler masses have the benefit of suppressing
      explosions (col. 1, lines 5-8).  Therefore, it would have been obvious to a
      person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to have
      incorporated the concept of an expanded metal filler as taught by Szego in the
      battery pack of Cromer to suppress explosions.  Cromer and Szego are related
      art as Cromer discloses battery short-circuits can cause the battery to overheat,
      causing risk of smoke and/or fire ([0003]).  Moreover, Cromer is interested
      in preventing cascade explosion (Fig. 5).  Metal is deemed to be inherently
      fire resistant.\\n\\nClaims 30 and 31 are rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C.
      103(a) as being unpatentable over US 2008/0042618 A1 (\u201CCromer\u201D) in
      view of US 4149649 (\u201CSzego\u201D) as applied to claim 1 above, and further
      in view of US 2003/0082439 A1 (\u201CSakakibara\u201D).\\nRegarding claims 30
      and 31, modified Cromer discloses the battery of claim 1 and that the mesh surrounds
      the entire area of the enclosing wall but does not expressly disclose the battery
      comprises only one battery cell.\\nSakakibara discloses a battery pack (99;
      abstract).  Sakakibara further discloses it is well known in the art that battery
      cells may be connected in parallel and/or in series in order to provide the
      desired battery voltage and output current ([0005]).  As one would readily recognize
      from this, if the system for which one is designing requires the voltage and
      output current of only a single cell only a single cell would be used.  number='15'Therefore,
      it would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the
      time of the invention to have optimized the number of cells, including one,
      as taught by Sakakibara based on the voltage and output current requirements
      of the system.\\n\\nResponse to Arguments\\n35 USC 112(a)\\nApplicant's arguments,
      see section (4)A. filed 09/26/2014 have been fully considered but they are not
      persuasive.  Claim 21 recites \u201Cat least one pressure relief feature including
      at least one portion at least partially disposed between at least two battery
      cells such that the portion extends between and along respective cell sides
      of each cell to permit gas to pass between the cells and through the casing
      when pressure in the casing exceeds a threshold\u201D (emphasis added).  It
      is not clear that applicant has support for the specific positioning of the
      pressure relief feature (i.e. \u201Cthe portion extends between and along respective
      cell sides\u201D).  While the examiner acknowledges general support for a pressure
      relief feature disposed between cells (Fig. 3), additional structural limitations
      are claimed which do not appear to be supported by the specification.  In Fig.
      3, applicant shows pressure relief feature 34 disposed near adjacent ends of
      two cells 30, not disposed between and extending between and along respective
      cell sides.  In Fig. 4, pressure relief features 52 are shown, but the figure
      is a schematic top view and no discussion is given regarding their positioning
      between and extending between and along respective cell sides.  The only features
      currently shown extending between and number='16'along respective cells sides
      of each cell are gas channels, which appear to be distinct from pressure relief
      features.  \\n35 USC 103(a)\\nApplicant\u2019s arguments, see section (4)B.iv.,
      filed 09/26/2014, with respect to the rejection(s) of claim(s) 30 under 35 USC
      103(a) have been fully considered and are persuasive.  Therefore, the rejection
      has been withdrawn.  However, upon further consideration, a new ground(s) of
      rejection is made further in view of US 2003/0082439 A1 (\u201CSakakibara\u201D).\\nApplicant's
      remaining arguments filed 09/26/2014 have been fully considered but they are
      not persuasive.\\nApplicant\u2019s principal arguments are the following:\\nSzego
      is non-analogous art (pp. 12-13 and 18).\\nSzego does not disclose the mesh
      material is overmolded or embedded onto at least part of the enclosing wall
      of the battery casing (pp. 14-15).\\nThe examiner incorrectly interpreted \u201Cthe
      mesh is wrapped at least partially around battery cells contained in the battery\u201D
      (pg. 16).\\nSzego\u2019s filler mass is not disclosed in the relied-upon portions
      of the reference as being disposed along the entire outer area. (pg. 17; pg.
      18, section D)\\nThe pressure relief feature of Cromer would not operate as
      claimed if positioned to extend between and along cell sides to permit gas to
      pass between the cells (pp. 17-18).number='17'\\nIn response, please consider
      the following:\\nIn response to applicant's argument that Szego is nonanalogous
      art, it has been held that a prior art reference must either be in the field
      of applicant\u2019s endeavor or, if not, then be reasonably pertinent to the
      particular problem with which the applicant was concerned, in order to be relied
      upon as a basis for rejection of the claimed invention.  See In re Oetiker,
      977 F.2d 1443, 24 USPQ2d 1443 (Fed. Cir. 1992).  In this case, the primary reference
      of Cromer discloses battery short-circuits can cause the battery to overheat,
      causing risk of smoke and/or fire ([0003]).  Moreover, Cromer is interested
      in preventing a cascade explosion (Fig. 5).  This prompts one of ordinary skill
      in the art to consider explosion-suppressive means, such as Szego.\\nOvermolding
      is defined by www.manufacturingterms.com as \u201Cthe process of molding over
      an insert, which becomes integral to the part on cooling.\u201D  Thus, an article
      that is overmolded is an article formed by this method.  Thus, the claimed product
      is formed over at least part of the enclosing wall and therefore, the claimed
      product does not appear to differ structurally from the combination of Cromer
      and Szego.\\nClaim 11 requires \u201Cthe mesh is wrapped at least partially
      around battery cells contained in the container.\u201D  Merriam Webster defines
      wrap as \u201Cto cover especially by winding or folding\u201D or \u201Csurround,
      envelop.\u201D  Surround is defined by Merriam Webster as \u201Cto enclose on
      all sides\u201D or \u201Cto extend around the margin or edge of.\u201D  Therefore,
      the claim is met if the mesh partially covers, surrounds, number='18'envelops,
      etc. the battery cells.  It is the position of the office that this is the case
      with the combination of Cromer and Szego.\\nThe examiner notes it is not required
      for the mesh to be disposed along the entire outer area of the container.  The
      mesh is provided in Szego inside the container.  When the combination is made,
      it follows that the mesh is provided inside the outer casing of Cromer and thus
      meets the limitations of claims 25, 32-34 as claimed (i.e. surrounding battery
      cells, disposed along at least a portion of the enclosing wall, disposed along
      at least one cell side).\\nIn re Japikse, 181 F.2d 1019, 86 USPQ 70 (CCPA 1950)
      is cited as legal support for the office\u2019s position that it would have
      been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the
      invention to dispose the pressure relief feature least partially between the
      at least two battery cells such that the portion extends between respective
      cells sides.  This modification does not appear to modify operation of the pressure
      relief feature as it would still relieve pressure.  Further motivation comes
      from Cromer which is concerned with efficiently exhausting any hot gases ([0048],
      [0053]) motivating one to explore ways of efficiently exhausting any hot gases,
      including rearranging the feature.\\n\\nContact Information\\nAny inquiry concerning

      10, 13-20, 23, 24, and 27 are rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being
      unpatentable over Frater et al (US 2002/0029780), in view of Schegerin (US 5,349,949)
      or, in the alternative, over Frater et al, in view of Schegerin, and further
      in view of Melidis et al (US 7,827,990).\\nAs to claim 10, Frater discloses
      a cushion 30 for a respiratory mask assembly 10 (Fig. 4, Fig. 5, fig. 10) that
      delivers breathable gas in a range of operating pressures to a patient, the
      cushion 30 comprising: a non-face contacting portion (where cushion 30 connects
      to shell 20, see Fig. 4, Fig. 5) connected to a frame 20; a face-contacting
      portion 34 structured to form a contact seal with a patient's face in use (paragraph
      [0044]); and a central portion 32 (Fig. 10) that interconnects the non-face
      contacting portion and the face-contacting portion 34, the central portion 32
      being structured to automatically adjust a component of force applied to the
      patient's face through the face-contacting portion 34 in accordance with operating
      pressure, while maintaining the contact seal throughout the range of operating
      pressures (paragraph [0043],[0045]).\\nFrater further discloses that the central
      portion includes a concertina structure 32 (see Fig. 10, Fig. 15 showing either
      one or three folds in gusset portion 32 providing a concertina structure, paragraphs
      [0043],[0063]) and that the cushion 30 is structured so  that the forces on
      the face from the cushion 30 are a function of mask pressure (paragraph [0045],[0050]-[0053]),
      wherein the concertina structure 32 extends radially outwardly from the face-contacting
      portion 34 to define a projected area (Ag) around the perimeter of the central
      portion 32 (see Fig. 10 or Fig. 15 of Frater, paragraph [0047]), but does not
      disclose that the central portion further includes a spring section with a spring
      constant.  However, Schegerin teaches a cushion 20 for a mask assembly 10 (Fig.
      6) comprising a spring structure 30 (Fig. 5, Fig. 7) provided in a central portion
      26 of the cushion 20 (col. 3, ln. 47-65), wherein the spring structure 30 will
      inherently have a spring constant.  Therefore, it would have been obvious to
      one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to modify
      the cushion of Frater to include the spring structure as taught by Schegerin
      in order to press the cushion uniformly against the face (col. 3, ln. 56-60).
      \ The modified cushion of Frater now discloses that the forces on the face from
      the cushion are also a function of the spring constant of the spring section
      (with the spring 30 of Schegerin applied to Frater\u2019s gusset portion 32,
      the spring constant will contribute to the forces applied to the face as well
      as the mask pressure).\\nAs to the limitation that the projected area of the
      concertina structure is variable around the perimeter of the central portion
      to vary forces applied by the concertina structure around the perimeter of the
      central portion and that the forces applied by the spring section are variable
      around a perimeter of the central portion, it appears that the modified cushion
      of Frater fulfills this limitation since one could simply press down on various
      sections of the mask cushion to increase the force applied by the spring in
      those sections, doing so would also increase the projected area in that section
      since the  gusset portion will be compressed, causing it to spread outward.
      \ Thus the forces and projected area applied by the concertina and spring section
      around a perimeter of the central portion are able to be varied.  Nevertheless,
      even if Frater\u2019s modified mask does not disclose that the forces applied
      by the spring section and the projected area of the concertina structure are
      variable around a perimeter of the central portion, Melidis teaches varying
      the cross-sectional shape/area and therefore forces applied by a concertina
      and spring section of a mask cushion around various portions of a mask cushion
      perimeter (Q1-Q6, Fig. 6, col. 7, ln. 10-23, col. 10, ln. 3-20).  Therefore,
      it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the
      invention was made to modify the cushion of Frater so that the concertina and
      spring section has a varying shape and therefore varies the forces applied around
      the mask perimeter, as taught by Melidis, in order to provide a more comfortable
      cushion shape which contours to the patient's facial anatomy.\\nAs to claim
      13, the modified cushion of Frater discloses the claimed invention including
      that the spring section includes an embedded wire spring (col. 4, ln. 42-44).\\nAs
      to claim 14, the modified cushion of Frater discloses the claimed invention
      including that the spring section includes a T- shaped spring 30 having a first
      anchored end and a second end structured to engage an internal shoulder portion
      of the face contacting portion (see illustrated Fig. 5 of Schegerin below).\\n
      \   PNG    media_image1.png    484    728    media_image1.png    Greyscale\\nAs
      to claim 15, Frater discloses that the central portion 32 includes an inwardly
      projecting gusset portion (Fig. 15, where the middle bellows structure can be
      considered inwardly projecting, for example, see also Fig. 16 as another example
      of an inwardly projecting gusset portion 32).\\nAs to claim 16, Frater discloses
      the claimed invention except for an internal compression spring to follow the
      contour of the inwardly projecting gusset portion. However, Schegerin teaches
      a cushion 20 for a mask assembly 10 (Fig. 6) comprising an internal compression
      spring 30 (Fig. 5) applied to the gusset portion 26 of the cushion 20 (col.
      3, ln. 47-65).  Therefore, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill
      in the art at the time the invention was made to modify the cushion of Frater
      to include the spring as taught by Schegerin in order to press the cushion uniformly
      against the face (col. 3, ln. 56-60).\\nAs to claim 17, Frater discloses the
      claimed invention except for an external tension spring to generally follow
      the contour of the inwardly projecting gusset portion.  However, Schegerin teaches
      a cushion 20 for a mask assembly 10 (Fig. 6) comprising an external compression
      spring 30 (Fig. 7) applied to the gusset portion 26 of the cushion 20 (col.
      3, ln. 47-65).  Therefore, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill
      in the art at the time the invention was made to modify the cushion of Frater
      to include the spring as taught by Schegerin in order to press the cushion uniformly
      against the face (col. 3, ln. 56-60).\\nAs to claim 18, Frater discloses that
      the inwardly projecting gusset portion 32 is constructed to be converted to
      an outwardly extending gusset portion, by everting action (since the gusset
      material is flexible, if enough force is applied to the middle bellows structure
      of gusset 32 in Fig. 16, for example, it can be pushed outward to extend outward
      instead of inward).\\nAs to claim 19, Frater discloses that the central portion
      32 includes an outwardly projecting gusset portion (see Fig. 10).\\nAs to claim
      20, Frater discloses the claimed invention except for a spring positioned on
      an inside of the outwardly projecting gusset portion. However, Schegerin teaches
      a cushion 20 for a mask assembly 10 (Fig. 6) comprising a spring 30 (Fig. 5)
      applied to inside of the gusset portion 26 of the cushion 20 (col. 3, ln. 47-65).
      \ Therefore, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art
      at the time the invention was made to modify the cushion of Frater to include
      the spring as taught by Schegerin in order to press the cushion uniformly against
      the face (col. 3, ln. 56-60).\\n As to claim 23, Frater discloses that the concertina
      structure 32 includes more than one fold (see Fig. 15 where three folds are
      shown forming a double gusset, paragraph [0063]).\\nAs to claim 24, Frater discloses
      that the concertina structure 32 includes four gusset sections or sidewalls
      (see illustrated Fig. 15 below where the arrows are pointing to the four sidewalls).\\n
      \   PNG    media_image2.png    380    673    media_image2.png    Greyscale\\nAs
      to claim 27, Frater discloses that the projected area (Ag, see Frater, Fig.
      10, Fig. 15) extends outside an area of contact (Ac) between the face-contacting
      portion 34 and the patient's face (see Frater Fig. 10, Fig. 15, paragraphs [0046],[0047]).

      the unjustified or improper timewise extension of the \u201Cright to exclude\u201D
      granted by a patent and to prevent possible harassment by multiple assignees.
      A nonstatutory double patenting rejection is appropriate where the claims at
      issue are not identical, but at least one examined application claim is not
      patentably distinct from the reference claim(s) because the examined application
      claim is either anticipated by, or would have been obvious over, the reference
      claim(s). See, e.g., In re Berg, 140 F.3d 1428, 46 USPQ2d 1226 (Fed. Cir. 1998);

      \\nAlthough the claims at issue are not identical, they are not patentably distinct
      from each other because the difference between the patented claims and the instant
      claims are minor and obvious from each other.  For example, the instant claim
      10 is a broader version of the patented claims 1-3 (i.e., the instant claim
      10 does not include the ring-shaped reinforcement portion as in the patented
      claims 1-3).  In the instant claim 10, the structural elements are included
      in the patented claims 1-3 (the second footprint area of the gusset portion
      of the patented claim 1 is defined such that it will extend radially outward
      of the face-contacting portion, such as is claimed in the instant claim 1).
      \ Any infringement over the patented claims would also infringe over the instant
      claims.  Hence, the instant claims 10, 13, 14, 19, and 20 do not differ from
      the scope of the patented claims 1-7.  \\n Claim Rejections - 35 USC \xA7 103\\nThe
      following is a quotation of pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) which forms the basis
      for all obviousness rejections set forth in this Office action:\\n(a) A patent
      may not be obtained though the invention is not identically disclosed or described
      as set forth in section 102, if the differences between the subject matter sought
      to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole
      would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having
      ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains. Patentability
      shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made.\\n\\nClaims
      10, 13-20, 23, 24, and 27 are rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being
      unpatentable over Frater et al (US 2002/0029780), in view of Schegerin (US 5,349,949)
      or, in the alternative, over Frater et al, in view of Schegerin, and further
      in view of Melidis et al (US 7,827,990).\\nAs to claim 10, Frater discloses
      a cushion 30 for a respiratory mask assembly 10 (Fig. 4, Fig. 5, fig. 10) that
      delivers breathable gas in a range of operating pressures to a patient, the
      cushion 30 comprising: a non-face contacting portion (where cushion 30 connects
      to shell 20, see Fig. 4, Fig. 5) connected to a frame 20; a face-contacting
      portion 34 structured to form a contact seal with a patient's face in use (paragraph
      [0044]); and a central portion 32 (Fig. 10) that interconnects the non-face
      contacting portion and the face-contacting portion 34, the central portion 32
      being structured to automatically adjust a component of force applied to the
      patient's face through the face-contacting portion 34 in accordance with operating
      pressure, while maintaining the contact seal throughout the range of operating
      pressures (paragraph [0043],[0045]).\\nFrater further discloses that the central
      portion includes a concertina structure 32 (see Fig. 10, Fig. 15 showing either
      one or three folds in gusset portion 32 providing a concertina structure, paragraphs
      [0043],[0063]) and that the cushion 30 is structured so  that the forces on
      the face from the cushion 30 are a function of mask pressure (paragraph [0045],[0050]-[0053]),
      wherein the concertina structure 32 extends radially outwardly from the face-contacting
      portion 34 to define a projected area (Ag) around the perimeter of the central
      portion 32 (see Fig. 10 or Fig. 15 of Frater, paragraph [0047]), but does not
      disclose that the central portion further includes a spring section with a spring
      constant.  However, Schegerin teaches a cushion 20 for a mask assembly 10 (Fig.
      6) comprising a spring structure 30 (Fig. 5, Fig. 7) provided in a central portion
      26 of the cushion 20 (col. 3, ln. 47-65), wherein the spring structure 30 will
      inherently have a spring constant.  Therefore, it would have been obvious to
      one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to modify
      the cushion of Frater to include the spring structure as taught by Schegerin
      in order to press the cushion uniformly against the face (col. 3, ln. 56-60).
      \ The modified cushion of Frater now discloses that the forces on the face from
      the cushion are also a function of the spring constant of the spring section
      (with the spring 30 of Schegerin applied to Frater\u2019s gusset portion 32,
      the spring constant will contribute to the forces applied to the face as well
      as the mask pressure).\\nAs to the limitation that the projected area of the
      concertina structure is variable around the perimeter of the central portion
      to vary forces applied by the concertina structure around the perimeter of the
      central portion and that the forces applied by the spring section are variable
      around a perimeter of the central portion, it appears that the modified cushion
      of Frater fulfills this limitation since one could simply press down on various
      sections of the mask cushion to increase the force applied by the spring in
      those sections, doing so would also increase the projected area in that section
      since the  gusset portion will be compressed, causing it to spread outward.
      \ Thus the forces and projected area applied by the concertina and spring section
      around a perimeter of the central portion are able to be varied.  Nevertheless,
      even if Frater\u2019s modified mask does not disclose that the forces applied
      by the spring section and the projected area of the concertina structure are
      variable around a perimeter of the central portion, Melidis teaches varying
      the cross-sectional shape/area and therefore forces applied by a concertina
      and spring section of a mask cushion around various portions of a mask cushion
      perimeter (Q1-Q6, Fig. 6, col. 7, ln. 10-23, col. 10, ln. 3-20).  Therefore,
      it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the
      invention was made to modify the cushion of Frater so that the concertina and
      spring section has a varying shape and therefore varies the forces applied around
      the mask perimeter, as taught by Melidis, in order to provide a more comfortable
      cushion shape which contours to the patient's facial anatomy.\\nAs to claim
      13, the modified cushion of Frater discloses the claimed invention including
      that the spring section includes an embedded wire spring (col. 4, ln. 42-44).\\nAs
      to claim 14, the modified cushion of Frater discloses the claimed invention
      including that the spring section includes a T- shaped spring 30 having a first
      anchored end and a second end structured to engage an internal shoulder portion
      of the face contacting portion (see illustrated Fig. 5 of Schegerin below).\\n
      \   PNG    media_image1.png    484    728    media_image1.png    Greyscale\\nAs
      to claim 15, Frater discloses that the central portion 32 includes an inwardly
      projecting gusset portion (Fig. 15, where the middle bellows structure can be
      considered inwardly projecting, for example, see also Fig. 16 as another example
      of an inwardly projecting gusset portion 32).\\nAs to claim 16, Frater discloses
      the claimed invention except for an internal compression spring to follow the
      contour of the inwardly projecting gusset portion. However, Schegerin teaches
      a cushion 20 for a mask assembly 10 (Fig. 6) comprising an internal compression
      spring 30 (Fig. 5) applied to the gusset portion 26 of the cushion 20 (col.
      3, ln. 47-65).  Therefore, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill
      in the art at the time the invention was made to modify the cushion of Frater
      to include the spring as taught by Schegerin in order to press the cushion uniformly
      against the face (col. 3, ln. 56-60).\\nAs to claim 17, Frater discloses the
      claimed invention except for an external tension spring to generally follow
      the contour of the inwardly projecting gusset portion.  However, Schegerin teaches
      a cushion 20 for a mask assembly 10 (Fig. 6) comprising an external compression
      spring 30 (Fig. 7) applied to the gusset portion 26 of the cushion 20 (col.
      3, ln. 47-65).  Therefore, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill
      in the art at the time the invention was made to modify the cushion of Frater
      to include the spring as taught by Schegerin in order to press the cushion uniformly
      against the face (col. 3, ln. 56-60).\\nAs to claim 18, Frater discloses that
      the inwardly projecting gusset portion 32 is constructed to be converted to
      an outwardly extending gusset portion, by everting action (since the gusset
      material is flexible, if enough force is applied to the middle bellows structure
      of gusset 32 in Fig. 16, for example, it can be pushed outward to extend outward
      instead of inward).\\nAs to claim 19, Frater discloses that the central portion
      32 includes an outwardly projecting gusset portion (see Fig. 10).\\nAs to claim
      20, Frater discloses the claimed invention except for a spring positioned on
      an inside of the outwardly projecting gusset portion. However, Schegerin teaches
      a cushion 20 for a mask assembly 10 (Fig. 6) comprising a spring 30 (Fig. 5)
      applied to inside of the gusset portion 26 of the cushion 20 (col. 3, ln. 47-65).
      \ Therefore, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art
      at the time the invention was made to modify the cushion of Frater to include
      the spring as taught by Schegerin in order to press the cushion uniformly against
      the face (col. 3, ln. 56-60).\\n As to claim 23, Frater discloses that the concertina
      structure 32 includes more than one fold (see Fig. 15 where three folds are
      shown forming a double gusset, paragraph [0063]).\\nAs to claim 24, Frater discloses
      that the concertina structure 32 includes four gusset sections or sidewalls
      (see illustrated Fig. 15 below where the arrows are pointing to the four sidewalls).\\n
      \   PNG    media_image2.png    380    673    media_image2.png    Greyscale\\nAs
      to claim 27, Frater discloses that the projected area (Ag, see Frater, Fig.
      10, Fig. 15) extends outside an area of contact (Ac) between the face-contacting
      portion 34 and the patient's face (see Frater Fig. 10, Fig. 15, paragraphs [0046],[0047]).
      \\nAllowable Subject Matter\\nClaims 1-9, 22 and 26 are allowed.\\nClaims 28
      and 29 objected to as being dependent upon a rejected base claim, but would
      be allowable if rewritten in independent form including all of the limitations
      of the base claim and any intervening claims.\\n Response to Arguments\\nApplicant's
      arguments filed August 7, 2017 have been fully considered but they are not persuasive.
      \\nApplicant argues on page 7 of the remarks that Frater, Schegerin, and Melidis
      do not teach or suggest that a concertina structure extends radially outwardly
      from the face-contacting portion to define a projected area that is variable
      around the perimeter of the central portion to vary forces applied by the concertina
      structure around the perimeter.  However, the argument is not well taken because
      Frater clearly discloses a concertina (gusset) structure 32 which extends radially
      outward of the face-contacting portion 34, as shown by the Area Ag vs the smaller
      inwardly disposed area Ac in Fig. 10 and Fig. 15 of Frater.  As to the limitation
      that the projected area of the concertina structure and therefore the forces
      applied by the concertina structure are variable, Frater\u2019s mask is able
      to perform the claimed function, simply by pressing down on various sections
      of the cushion around the perimeter, and even if this does not read on the projected
      area and forces being variable around the perimeter, Melidis teaches this feature,
      as described above, with reference to Fig. 6, by varying the shape of the concertina
      structure at various points around the perimeter of the cushion to vary the
      forces applied in these sections to better conform to the varying topography
      of a user\u2019s face.  Thus, the limitations in question are met by the modified
      Frater mask and the rejection stands.\\nnumber='10'Conclusion\\nApplicant's
      amendment necessitated the new ground(s) of rejection presented in this Office
      action.  Accordingly, THIS ACTION IS MADE FINAL.  See MPEP \xA7 706.07(a).  Applicant

      amendment filed on December 7, 2021 has been fully considered. No request to
      consider the amendment under AFCP2.0 has been filed. The amendment has been
      considered under a pre-pilot practice.\\n\\n2.   The amendment has been fully
      considered, but is not entered given it raises new issues that would require
      further consideration and/or search. With respect to new issues, instant claims
      28 and 30 are improperly dependent on claim 8, which is cancelled. Further,
      the current amendment would change the scope of claim 1, and thereby the scope
      of claims dependent on claim 1, and thereby would require further consideration
      and/or search.\\n\\n3.  With respect to Applicant\u2019s arguments regarding
      the rejection of Claims 1, 4, 11, 13, 14, 18-27, 29 under 35 U.S.C. 103 as obvious
      over Jones et al (US 2004/0092648), as evidenced by Escorez 5600 Tackifying
      resin flyer, ExxonMobil, and Claims 1, 4, 8, 11, 13, 14, 18-30 under  35 U.S.C.
      103 as obvious over  Jones et al (US 2004/0092648) in view of Jacob et al (US
      6,384,138) and Donker et al (US 6,605,680), as evidenced by Escorez 2203LC flyer
      and Escorez 5600 Tackifying resin flyer, ExxonMobil, it is noted that:\\n1)
      Jones et al discloses an air barrier such as tire innerliner (Abstract) comprising
      a composition comprising:\\na) at least one an elastomer comprising butyl rubber
      or halogenated butyl rubber, specifically butyl rubber halogenated with bromine,
      \ styrene-butadiene rubber, styrene-isoprene rubber, styrene-C4-C7 isoolefin
      copolymer, such as p-methylstyrene-isobutylene copolymer, ethylene-propylene
      rubber or EPDM ([0025], [0024], [0037], [0041], [0035], [0046], as to instant
      claim 24) and further nitrile rubber ([0113], as to instant claims 24-25);\\nb)
      \ 2-40 phr, or 2-10 phr ([0059]) of a tackifier hydrocarbon resin selected from
      the group consisting of:\\n   i) a C5 hydrocarbon resin having Tg below 50\xBAC,
      softening point of below 100\xBAC ([0062]), specifically commercial products
      ESCOREZ ([0063]-[0066])  and \\n   ii) oligomers having units of DCPD ([0072];
      [0071], [0083) having molecular weight Mn of 130-500  ([0008], [0021], [0060],
      [0071], [0081]), and polydispersity of 1.5 ([0081]), specifically commercial
      products ESCOREZ, ([0066])  wherein a DCPD resin is obtained by polymerization
      of monomers of DCPD ([0083]), i.e. appears to be a DCPD homopolymer or copolymer
      with aromatic monomers ([0083], as to instant claims 20-21)\\nor a combination
      of i) and ii).\\nThe specifically cited tackifier (corresponding to the tackifier
      b)ii)) comprises a commercial product ESCOREZ 5600 ([0066]). As evidenced by
      ESCOREX 5600 Tackifying resin flyer from ExxonMobil, ESCOREZ 5600 is having
      Mn of 500 g/mol, Tg of 55\xBAC (see Escorez 5600 Tackifying resin flyer).\\n\\n2)
      Though Jones et al recites the hydrocarbon resin preferably having Tg below
      50\xBAC ([0061]), this range is cited as preferable, this does not negate a
      finding of obviousness under 35 USC 103 since a preferred embodiment such as
      an example is not controlling.  Rather, all disclosures \u201Cincluding unpreferred
      embodiments\u201D must be considered.  In re Lamberti 192 USPQ 278, 280 (CCPA
      1976) citing In re Mills 176 USPQ 196 (CCPA 1972).  \\n3) Jones et al clearly
      teaches that use of commercial product ESCOREZ 5600 as the hydrocarbon resin
      ([0066]), which, as evidenced by ESCOREZ 5600 flyer from ExxonMobil is having
      Tg of 55\xBAC (see ESCOREZ 5600 flyer).\\n4) Even assuming the preferred hydrocarbon
      resin of Jones et al is having Tg of lower than 50\xBAC, the term \u201Clower
      than 50\xBAC\u201D includes values of 49.99\xBAC, which value of 49.99\xBAC
      is very close to the value of 50\xBAC as required by instant claim 1. It is
      the examiner\u2019s position that the values are close enough that one of ordinary
      skill in the art would have expected the same properties.  Case law holds that
      a prima facie case of obviousness exists where the claimed ranges and prior
      art ranges do not overlap but are close enough that one skilled in the art would
      have expected them to have the same properties.  Titanium Metals Corp. of America
      v. Banner, 778 F.2d 775, 227 USPQ 773 (Fed. Cir. 1985).  \\n5) Though Jones
      et al discloses the polydispersity of the hydrocarbon resin being 1.5, wherein
      instant claims 1 and 18 recite the polydispersity being 1.4, it is Examiner\u2019s
      position that the polydispersity values of 1.5 of Jones et al and 1.4 of instant
      claims are very close. It is the Examiner\u2019s position that the values are
      close enough that one of ordinary skill in the art would have expected the same
      properties.  Case law holds that a prima facie case of obviousness exists where
      the claimed ranges and prior art ranges do not overlap but are close enough

      Jose et al. (US 20140018002).\\nRegarding Claim 16, Ko teaches an apparatus
      (Figs. 10 and 11, i.e. first device 100), comprising:\\nat least one processor
      (Fig. 11, i.e. processor 1140);\\n at least one memory including computer program
      code (Fig. 11 supported by \xB6 [0186], i.e. memory 1150 may store a program
      and data for performing the application execution method according to an exemplary
      embodiment);\\nthe at least one memory and the computer program code configured
      to, with the at least one processor, cause the apparatus at least to (Figs.
      10 and 11 supported by \xB6 [0186], i.e. the processor 1140 may execute the
      program stored in the memory 1150 and perform the operations of the first device
      100 in accordance with the flowchart shown in Fig. 10):\\n establish pairing
      with the other device to establish a secure relationship with the other device
      over a first wireless carrier (Fig. 10 supported by \xB6 [0010], [0157], and
      [0158], i.e. where the first device 100 [apparatus] sets up a BLE link [first
      wireless carrier] by detecting an occurrence of a first short distance communication
      between at least one external device [other device, e.g. second device 120]
      and the first device [e.g. first device 100], receiving connection information
      which relates to a second short distance communication mode and application
      information which relates to the at least one external device, and performs
      authentication processing S1003 to enable a secure connection); \\nreceive a
      device address of the other device associated with the paired secure relationship
      over the first wireless carrier during establishment of the secure relationship
      with the other device (Fig. 10 supported by \xB6 [0067] and [0157], i.e. information
      sent from the second device (e.g. 120) to the first device (e.g. 100) may include
      \ address of the second device 120), the pairing providing authentication of
      the device address of the other device (Fig. 10 supported by \xB6 [0016], [0023],
      [0067], and [0158], i.e. where the connection information relates to the second
      short distance communication mode may further include authentication information
      which relates to the at least one external device, for example the device address
      of the external apparatus, and where authentication processing may be performed
      by authenticating authentication information which is received from the second
      device 120);\\ntransmit wireless  messages over a second wireless carrier to
      the other wireless device, the wireless  messages being addressed to the other
      device with which the apparatus has established secure relationship, with  the
      device address received by the apparatus over the first wireless carrier during
      pairing (Fig. 10 supported by \xB6 [0067] and [0165], i.e. the first device
      100 requests [transmits wireless message] the second device 120 for connection
      there between by using the received connection information, which may include
      an address of the second device 120 [device address received by the apparatus
      (first device 100) over the first wireless carrier (BLE) during pairing]); and\\nestablishing
      a wireless connection over the second wireless carrier with the other wireless
      device, based on the  device address  received by the apparatus over the first
      wireless carrier during pairing (Fig. 10 supported by \xB6 [0010], [0067], and
      [0165], i.e. establishing a connection by connection acceptance S1009 based
      on the second short distance communication mode (e.g. classic Bluetooth) between
      the at least one external device (e.g. second device 120) and the first device
      (e.g. first device 100) using the received connection information (e.g. address
      of the second device 120) received by the apparatus (first device 100) over
      the first wireless carrier (BLE) during pairing).\\nThat is, there are three
      distinctions between the claimed invention and the teachings of Ko, so that
      Ko cannot be relied upon for an anticipation rejection.\\nFirstly, Ko does not
      explicitly disclose request pairing with another wireless device over a first
      wireless carrier.  That is, Ko does not define the advertisement (not claimed
      here) and request (claimed) functionality of BLE (not claimed here), for example
      as in applicant\u2019s disclosure relating the BLE advertisement 450, BLE connect
      request 452, and BLE connection 454 (see Fig. 4B).\\nSecondly, Ko does not explicitly
      disclose derive the device access code from the device address received over
      the first wireless carrier during pairing, where this device access code is
      used for establishing the wireless connection over the second wireless carrier
      (e.g. Bluetooth BR/EDR, also known as classic Bluetooth).  That is, Ko does
      not define deriving, determining, or extracting the device access code from
      the device address.\\nnumber='10'Thirdly, Ko does not explicitly disclose transmission
      of paging messages (claimed) and reception of paging responses (not claimed
      here).  That is, Ko merely defines transmission and reception of generally named
      messages, and not specifically used for paging.\\nHowever, in the same field
      of endeavor or reasonably pertinent to establishing Bluetooth connections Desai
      teaches the initiator 140 (or scanner 130) [first device] may be operable to
      request establishment of a link layer connection (or send a connection request
      Connect_REQ) [request pairing] with an intended advertiser [second device],
      where the request is performed in the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication
      system, or for example in an advertising channel [BLE channel] (see Fig. 1 supported
      by \xB6 [0014], [0018], and [0022]).  That is, Desai teaches an initiator or
      scanner [first device] requesting a connection [pairing] with an advertiser
      [second or other device] over BLE [first wireless carrier].  Additionally, Desai
      teaches the scanner 130 may be operable to extract an access code from the received
      advertising packet. A device identity of an intended advertiser for the received
      advertising packet may be derived based on the extracted access code (see \xB6
      [0018] and [0020]).  That is, Desai teaches the scanner [first device] extracting
      [derive] the device access code from the device address [extracted access code
      or address] received over the first wireless carrier [BLE] during the connection
      [pairing] establishment.\\nMoreover, in the same field of endeavor or reasonably
      pertinent to establishing Bluetooth connections Jose teaches in order to establish
      a new Bluetooth connection, the paging procedure is used to establish an actual
      connection, where the creating of a number='11'connection between Bluetooth
      devices starts by getting the attention of the device by paging it [send paging
      messages] (see Figs. 1 and 2 supported by \xB6 [0044]).  That is, Jose teaches
      transmission of paging messages are necessary for establishing an actual Bluetooth
      connection.\\nTherefore it would have been obvious to those of ordinary skill
      in the art before the effective filing date of the claimed invention to utilize
      the teachings (1) an advertiser [second or other device] transmitting a BLE
      advertisement (not claimed), as taught by Desai, (2) a initiator or scanner
      [first device] transmits a connection [pairing] request via BLE communication,
      as taught by Desai, (3) receiving a device address of the second device, as
      taught by Ko, (4) where a device address includes a device access code that
      can be extracted for identifying the device, as taught by Desai, (5) using the
      identity of the identified device to establish a wireless connection over the
      second wireless carrier (e.g. classic Bluetooth), as taught by Ko, and (6) using
      paging messages to actually establish the Bluetooth connection, as taught by
      Jose \u2013 therefore arriving at the claimed invention.  The motivation to
      utilize the teachings of Ko, Desai, and Jose in this manner would have been
      to identify the device through the device address, specifically the device access
      code (Ko \xB6 [0016], [0067], [0072], & [0181] and Desai \xB6 [0014], [0018],
      & [0020]), and to utilize the paging message to actually establish the Bluetooth
      connection (Jose \xB6 [0044]).\\nIn summary, Ko sets for the foundation that
      BLE, specifically a device address transmitted via BLE, can be used to quickly
      establish a classic Bluetooth connection.  Whereas Desai and Jose provide supporting
      teachings (i.e. specifically, devices extract number='12'device access codes
      from the device addresses to identify the devices [further specificity than
      discussed within Ko], again see Desai, and specifically, paging messages are
      what are used for actually establishing a Bluetooth connection, again see Jose)
      and motivation (i.e. device access codes provide a means for specifically and/or
      precisely identifying the device, again see Desai, and paging messages provide
      a means for actually establishing the Bluetooth connection, again see Jose).\\nThat
      is, a person of ordinary skill would have been able to fit the teachings of
      multiple patents together like pieces of a puzzle.\\\"Id. at 420, 82 USPQ2d
      at 1397.  Also, the test for obviousness is not whether the features of a secondary
      references may be bodily incorporated into the structure of the primary reference;
      nor is it that the claimed invention must be expressly suggested in any one
      or all of the references.  Rather, the test is what the combined teachings of
      the references would have suggested to those of ordinary skill in the art.  See
      In re Keller, 642 F.2d 413, 208 USPQ 871 (CCPA 1981).  In this case, although
      none of the references individually teach the claimed invention, those of ordinary
      skill in the art would have arrived at the claimed invention when considering
      the teachings, suggestions, and/or motivations of the references in combination,
      as outlined above (i.e. since it was known to (1) use BLE to establish classic
      Bluetooth (quicker than conventional classic Bluetooth setup), (2) use a device
      address, and more specifically a device access code, to identify and address
      a specific device (securer method than broadcasting communication since devices
      are communicating directly), and (3) use paging messages to establish a Bluetooth
      connection (necessity of classic Bluetooth connection to get the attention of
      a device number='13'and respond accordingly)).\\n Regarding Claims 1, 6, 11,
      21, and 22, claims 1, 6, 11, 16, 21, and 22 are rejected for the same reason
      as claim 16, as set forth above, since the claims have similar limitations that
      can be met by the same teachings of Ko, Jose, and Desai.  Claims 1, 11, and
      21 being the counterpart device, external device/second device 120.  Additionally,
      where the processor (1240), memory (1250), computer program product (1250),
      and/or non-transitory storage medium (\xB6 [0029]) elements of claims 11 and
      21 are being mapped to the elements of the second device 120 (being the counterpart
      of the first device 100 already described above).\\nRegarding Claim 2, the combined
      teachings of Ko, Jose, and Desai teach or suggest all the limitations of the
      method of claim 1.\\nJose further teaches wherein the device address of the
      apparatus associated with the secure relationship is a unique address of the
      apparatus (\xB6 [0032]).\\nTherefore it would have been obvious to those of
      ordinary skill in the art before the effective filing date of the claimed invention
      to utilize the unique identification number teachings, as taught by Jose, with
      the dual mode communication teachings, as taught by Ko, to arrive at the claimed
      invention.  The motivation to utilize the teachings of Ko and Jose together
      would have been to provide additional security (Jose \xB6 [0032]).\\n number='14'Regarding
      Claims 7, 12, and 17, claims 7, 12, and 17 are rejected for the same reason
      as claim 2, as set forth above, since the claims have similar limitations that
      can be met by the same teachings of Ko, Jose, and Desai.\\nRegarding Claim 3,
      the combined teachings of Ko, Jose, and Desai teach or suggest all the limitations
      of the method of claim 1.  Ko further teaches wherein the first wireless carrier
      is Bluetooth Low Energy protocol (\xB6 [0221]).\\n Regarding Claims 8, 13, and
      18, claims 8, 13, and 18 are rejected for the same reason as claim 3, as set
      forth above, since the claims have similar limitations that can be met by the
      same teachings of Ko, Jose, and Desai.\\nRegarding Claim 4, the combined teachings
      of Ko, Jose, and Desai teach or suggest all the limitations of the method of
      claim 1.\\nWhile Ko does teach wherein the second wireless carrier is Bluetooth
      basic rate/enhanced data rate protocol (\xB6 [0099] and [0184], i.e. classic
      Bluetooth [also referred in the art as basic rate/enhanced data rate (BR/EDR)]),
      Ko does not explicitly disclose the wireless paging messages are Bluetooth basic
      rate/enhanced data rate paging packets.\\nJose further teaches classic Bluetooth
      [also referred in the art as basic rate/enhanced data rate (BR/EDR)] mode when
      communicating with a hub device (and exchanging paging packets with the at least
      one hub (\xB6 [0009], [0031], and [0044]).  number='15'That is, the paging packets
      in this embodiment are performed through classic Bluetooth [also referred in
      the art as basic rate/enhanced data rate (BR/EDR)].\\nTherefore it would have
      been obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art before the effective filing
      date of the claimed invention to utilize the classic Bluetooth paging packet
      teachings, as taught by Jose, with the dual mode communication teachings, as
      taught by Ko, to arrive at the claimed invention.  The motivation to utilize
      the teachings of Ko and Jose together would have been to establish a Bluetooth
      connection using a paging signals (Jose \xB6 [0044]).\\n Regarding Claims 9,
      14, and 19, claims 9, 14, and 19 are rejected for the same reason as claim 4,
      as set forth above, since the claims have similar limitations that can be met
      by the same teachings of Ko, Jose, and Desai.\\nRegarding Claim 5, the combined
      teachings of Ko, Jose, and Desai teach or suggest all the limitations of the
      method of claim 3.\\nThe difference between the claimed invention and the combination
      of Ko and Jose is that neither Ko nor Jose teach wherein the device address
      of the apparatus associated with the secure relationship is a 48-bit Bluetooth
      device address.\\nHowever Desai further teaches the device identity information
      may comprise non-private device identity such as 48-bit Bluetooth low energy
      device addresses, and/or private device identity information such as Resolvable
      Private Addresses (RPAs) number='16'and/or Identity Root Key (IRK) for concurrent
      support of privacy and white listing (\xB6 [0014]).\\nTherefore it would have
      been obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art before the effective filing
      date of the claimed invention to utilize the 48-bit BLE address teachings, as
      taught by Desai, with the teachings of Ko and Jose to arrive at the claimed
      invention.  The motivation to utilize the teachings of Ko, Jose, and Desai together
      would have been to utilize a well-known BLE address format for identification
      and/or security (Desai \xB6 [0014]).\\n Regarding Claims 10, 15, and 20, claims
      10, 15, and 20 are rejected for the same reason as claim 5, as set forth above,
      since the claims have similar limitations that can be met by the same teachings
      of Ko, Jose, and Desai.\\n\"],\n        \"sections.submissionDate\":\"2017-05-10T04:00:00Z\",\n

      ACTION\\nThis Office Action is in response to the Applicants\u2019 communication
      filed on 27 January 2017. In virtue of this communication, claims 1-22 are currently
      pending in the instant application.\\n\\nNotice of Pre-AIA  or AIA  Status\\nThe
      present application, filed on or after March 16, 2013, is being examined under
      the first inventor to file provisions of the AIA .\\n\\nInformation Disclosure
      Statement\\n2.\\tThe information disclosure statements (IDS) submitted on 3
      March 2017 and 22 March 2017 are in compliance with the provisions of 37 CFR
      1.97.  Accordingly, the examiner has considered the information disclosure statement.\\n\\nResponse
      to Arguments\\nApplicant's arguments filed 27 January 2017 have been fully considered
      but they are not persuasive.\\nAlthough the remarks are of great length, it
      does not seem they address the position presented in the office action.  That
      is, the pertinent parts of the applicant\u2019s remarks do not appear to begin
      until page 17, and first addresses KO individually as not disclosing or suggesting
      the applicant\u2019s claim (which obviously the examiner agrees with as the
      previous office action does not rely solely on KO to meet all the limitations
      \ argued), second addresses Jose individually as not disclosing or suggesting
      the applicant\u2019s claim (which obviously the examiner agrees with as the
      previous office action does not rely solely on Jose to meet all the limitations
      argued), and third addresses Desai individually as not disclosing or suggesting
      the applicant\u2019s claim (which obviously the examiner agrees with as the
      previous office action does not rely solely on Desai to meet all the limitations
      argued).  The differences between the prior art and the claimed invention have
      been explicitly recited by the examiner in the office action, and repeating
      only the difference between the prior art and claimed invention in the applicant\u2019s
      remarks do not address the position taken by the examiner, and actually makes
      the prosecution history harder to understand since nothing more is provided
      beyond generalities (which is really the only part that was needed in the remarks
      and also the only part not included).\\nThe applicant\u2019s remarks then do
      turn to the issue at hand (i.e. obviousness in view of the combined teachings
      of KO, Jose, and Desai).  The applicant generally states that the combination
      of KO, Jose, and Desai does not disclose or suggest the applicant\u2019s claim
      (reciting again what the claim limits with associated examples).  However, the
      applicant does not provide reasons why the obviousness presented is lacking.\\nIn
      brief summary, the examiner\u2019s position is that KO teaches exchanging device
      addresses via BLE (first wireless carrier) for establishment of Bluetooth classic
      (second wireless carrier, Bluetooth BR/EDR, secure relationship) connection
      using the device address of the pairing partner (as received from the partner
      via BLE during procedure of  establishing Bluetooth Classic).  And where KO
      is deficient in discussing the device access code, both Jose and Desai supplement
      the teachings of KO, by each teaching in their own right that device access
      codes are embedded with the device address (BLE and/or Bluetooth Classic).  Therefore
      considering these teachings in light of the teachings of KO, those of ordinary
      skill in the art would have been led to not only exchange a device address (as
      with considering KO individually), but to further exchange device addresses
      that are embedded with a device access code for sending address based communication
      (just as in the address based communication of KO, except with a device access
      code added for further specificity into how the devices address each other in
      communication).  That is, a device sending its device address via BLE (as in
      KO) embedded with a device access code (as in Jose and Desai) to be used to
      establish a Bluetooth Classic connection (as in KO), which is a secure connection,
      where the device access code is extracted from the address (as in Jose) for
      another device to communicate directly with the other device (as in KO).\\nIn
      disproving the obviousness, the applicant arguments would be persuasive by directly
      explaining why those of ordinary skill in the art would not have reached the
      claimed invention, for example by explaining why the device access code (as
      in Jose and Desai) could not or would not be used within the device address
      (as in KO).  That is, KO essentially teaches the same as the claimed invention
      (i.e. exchanging a device address over BLE in the process of establishing a
      direct, device address based, Bluetooth Classic [Bluetooth BR/EDR]), but not
      to the specificity of including a device access code within the device address,
      whereas Jose and Desai provide the specificity  of how a device access code
      is within a paging message to identify the device.  Therefore why wouldn\u2019t
      those of ordinary skill in the art be able to use the teaching of the device
      access code within the paging message of Jose and/or Desai with the teaching
      of exchanging device address via BLE in the process of establishing a Bluetooth
      Classic communication where messages are sent using device identities.\\nThe
      examiner is not able to identify any reason why those of ordinary skill in the
      art would not have arrived at the claimed invention, since the teachings are
      supported by motivation to arrive at such a conclusion.  Furthermore, the applicant
      has not presented the examiner with any actual reasons, but instead general
      statements of allowability or non-obviousness without further explanation.  The
      applicant may be right in their conclusion of allowability/non-obviousness,
      but since the applicant has not given an explanation in their remarks or through
      an interview requested by the examiner, the examiner is unable to agree or disagree
      (and instead is just left to clarify the position as the applicant clarifies
      the claim with amendments).\\nIt is specifically suggested that the applicant,
      in the next response either (1) call the examiner for an interview to expedite
      processing of the application to allowance, (2) amend the claim to provide the
      full detail of the claimed invention (e.g. each step carried out or each element
      of the apparatus), and/or (3) forgo a lengthy or repetitive response, and instead
      focus on simply explaining why those of ordinary skill in the art would not
      have been able to arrive at the claimed invention considering the teachings,
      suggestions, and motivation as well as the guidance that those of ordinary skill
      in the art are skilled and able to put pieces of inventions together like pieces
      of a puzzle where  motivation so leads them.  \\\"A person of ordinary skill
      in the art is also a person of ordinary creativity, not an automaton.\\\"KSR,
      550 U.S. at 421, 82 USPQ2d at 1397. \\\"[I]n many cases a person of ordinary
      skill will be able to fit the teachings of multiple patents together like pieces
      of a puzzle.\\\"Id. at 420, 82 USPQ2d at 1397. Office personnel may also take
      into account \\\"the inferences and creative steps that a person of ordinary
      skill in the art would employ.\\\"Id. at 418, 82 USPQ2d at 1396 \\nSimply stated:
      \ the applicant should provide their reasons for allowance by explanation of
      the differences and why skilled artisans would not have been able to arrive
      at the claimed invention.  Then it may be that the examiner agrees, or if in
      disagreement the examiner may quickly point to some limitation that is argued
      but not claimed and move the application to allowance.\\n\\nWithdrawn Rejections\\nApplicant\u2019s
      arguments, see pg. 10 lines 15-18, filed 27 January 2017, with respect to claims
      1, 6, 11, 16, 21, and 22 have been fully considered and are persuasive.  The
      rejection under 35 U.S.C. 112(b) or 35 U.S.C. 112 (pre-AIA ), second paragraph
      of 30 December 2016 has been withdrawn.\\n\\nClaim Rejections - 35 USC \xA7
      103\\nIn the event the determination of the status of the application as subject
      to AIA  35 U.S.C. 102 and 103 (or as subject to pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 102 and 103)
      is incorrect, any correction of the statutory basis for the rejection will not
      be considered a new ground of  rejection if the prior art relied upon, and the
      rationale supporting the rejection, would be the same under either status.  \\nThe
      following is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 103 which forms the basis for all obviousness
      rejections set forth in this Office action:\\nA patent for a claimed invention
      may not be obtained, notwithstanding that the claimed invention is not identically
      disclosed as set forth in section 102 of this title, if the differences between
      the claimed invention and the prior art are such that the claimed invention
      as a whole would have been obvious before the effective filing date of the claimed
      invention to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which the claimed
      invention pertains.  Patentability shall not be negated by the manner in which
      the invention was made.\\n\\nThe factual inquiries set forth in Graham v. John
      Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 148 USPQ 459 (1966), that are applied for establishing
      a background for determining obviousness under 35 U.S.C. 103 are summarized
      as follows:\\n1. Determining the scope and contents of the prior art.\\n2. Ascertaining
      the differences between the prior art and the claims at issue.\\n3. Resolving
      the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art.\\n4. Considering objective
      evidence present in the application indicating obviousness or nonobviousness.\\nClaims
      1-22 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable over KO et al. (US
      20140073244) in view of Desai et al. (US 20110319020), and further in view of
      Jose et al. (US 20140018002).\\nRegarding Claim 16, Ko teaches an apparatus
      (Figs. 10 and 11, i.e. first device 100), comprising:\\nat least one processor
      (Fig. 11, i.e. processor 1140);\\n at least one memory including computer program
      code (Fig. 11 supported by \xB6 [0186], i.e. memory 1150 may store a program
      and data for performing the application execution method according to an exemplary
      embodiment);\\nthe at least one memory and the computer program code configured
      to, with the at least one processor, cause the apparatus at least to (Figs.
      10 and 11 supported by \xB6 [0186], i.e. the processor 1140 may execute the
      program stored in the memory 1150 and perform the operations of the first device
      100 in accordance with the flowchart shown in Fig. 10):\\n establish pairing
      with the other device to establish a secure relationship with the other device
      over a first wireless carrier (Fig. 10 supported by \xB6 [0010], [0157], and
      [0158], i.e. where the first device 100 [apparatus] sets up a BLE link [first
      wireless carrier] by detecting an occurrence of a first short distance communication
      between at least one external device [other device, e.g. second device 120]
      and the first device [e.g. first device 100], receiving connection information
      which relates to a second short distance communication mode and application
      information which relates to the at least one external device, and performs
      authentication processing S1003 to enable a secure connection); \\nreceive a
      device address of the other device associated with the paired secure relationship
      over the first wireless carrier during establishment of the secure relationship
      with the other device (Fig. 10 supported by \xB6 [0067] and [0157], i.e. information
      sent from the second device (e.g. 120) to the first device (e.g. 100) may include
      \ address of the second device 120), the pairing providing authentication of
      the device address of the other device (Fig. 10 supported by \xB6 [0016], [0023],
      [0067], and [0158], i.e. where the connection information relates to the second
      short distance communication mode may further include authentication information
      which relates to the at least one external device, for example the device address
      of the external apparatus, and where authentication processing may be performed
      by authenticating authentication information which is received from the second
      device 120);\\n\\ntransmit wireless  messages over a second wireless carrier
      to the other wireless device, the wireless  messages being addressed to the
      other device with which the apparatus has established secure relationship, with
      \ the device address received by the apparatus over the first wireless carrier
      during pairing (Fig. 10 supported by \xB6 [0067] and [0165], i.e. the first
      device 100 requests [transmits wireless message] the second device 120 for connection
      there between by using the received connection information, which may include
      an address of the second device 120 [device address received by the apparatus
      (first device 100) over the first wireless carrier (BLE) during pairing]); and\\nestablishing
      a wireless connection over the second wireless carrier with the other wireless
      device, based on the  device address  received by the apparatus over the first
      wireless carrier during pairing (Fig. 10 supported by \xB6 [0010], [0067], and
      [0165], i.e. establishing a connection by connection acceptance S1009 based
      on the second short distance communication mode (e.g. classic Bluetooth) between
      the at least one external device (e.g. second device 120) and the first device
      (e.g. first device 100) using the received connection information (e.g. address
      of the second device 120) received by the apparatus (first device 100) over
      the first wireless carrier (BLE) during pairing).\\nThat is, there are three
      distinctions between the claimed invention and the teachings of Ko, so that
      Ko cannot be relied upon for an anticipation rejection.\\nFirstly, Ko does not
      explicitly disclose request pairing with another wireless device over a first
      wireless carrier.  That is, Ko does not define the advertisement (not claimed
      here) and request (claimed) functionality of BLE (not claimed here), for example
      as in applicant\u2019s disclosure relating the BLE advertisement 450, BLE connect
      request 452, and BLE connection 454 (see Fig. 4B).\\nSecondly, Ko does not explicitly
      disclose derive the device access code from the device address received over
      the first wireless carrier during pairing, where this device access code is
      used for establishing the wireless connection over the second wireless carrier
      (e.g. Bluetooth BR/EDR, also known as classic Bluetooth).  That is, Ko does
      not define deriving, determining, or extracting the device access code from
      the device address.\\nnumber='10'Thirdly, Ko does not explicitly disclose transmission
      of paging messages (claimed) and reception of paging responses (not claimed
      here).  That is, Ko merely defines transmission and reception of generally named
      messages, and not specifically used for paging.\\nHowever, in the same field
      of endeavor or reasonably pertinent to establishing Bluetooth connections Desai
      teaches the initiator 140 (or scanner 130) [first device] may be operable to
      request establishment of a link layer connection (or send a connection request
      Connect_REQ) [request pairing] with an intended advertiser [second device],
      where the request is performed in the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication
      system, or for example in an advertising channel [BLE channel] (see Fig. 1 supported
      by \xB6 [0014], [0018], and [0022]).  That is, Desai teaches an initiator or
      scanner [first device] requesting a connection [pairing] with an advertiser
      [second or other device] over BLE [first wireless carrier].  Additionally, Desai
      teaches the scanner 130 may be operable to extract an access code from the received
      advertising packet. A device identity of an intended advertiser for the received
      advertising packet may be derived based on the extracted access code (see \xB6
      [0018] and [0020]).  That is, Desai teaches the scanner [first device] extracting
      [derive] the device access code from the device address [extracted access code
      or address] received over the first wireless carrier [BLE] during the connection
      [pairing] establishment.\\nMoreover, in the same field of endeavor or reasonably
      pertinent to establishing Bluetooth connections Jose teaches in order to establish
      a new Bluetooth connection, the paging procedure is used to establish an actual
      connection, where the creating of a number='11'connection between Bluetooth
      devices starts by getting the attention of the device by paging it [send paging
      messages] (see Figs. 1 and 2 supported by \xB6 [0044]).  That is, Jose teaches
      transmission of paging messages are necessary for establishing an actual Bluetooth
      connection.\\nTherefore it would have been obvious to those of ordinary skill
      in the art before the effective filing date of the claimed invention to utilize
      the teachings (1) an advertiser [second or other device] transmitting a BLE
      advertisement (not claimed), as taught by Desai, (2) a initiator or scanner
      [first device] transmits a connection [pairing] request via BLE communication,
      as taught by Desai, (3) receiving a device address of the second device, as
      taught by Ko, (4) where a device address includes a device access code that
      can be extracted for identifying the device, as taught by Desai, (5) using the
      identity of the identified device to establish a wireless connection over the
      second wireless carrier (e.g. classic Bluetooth), as taught by Ko, and (6) using
      paging messages to actually establish the Bluetooth connection, as taught by
      Jose \u2013 therefore arriving at the claimed invention.  The motivation to
      utilize the teachings of Ko, Desai, and Jose in this manner would have been
      to identify the device through the device address, specifically the device access
      code (Ko \xB6 [0016], [0067], [0072], & [0181] and Desai \xB6 [0014], [0018],
      & [0020]), and to utilize the paging message to actually establish the Bluetooth
      connection (Jose \xB6 [0044]).\\nIn summary, Ko sets for the foundation that
      BLE, specifically a device address transmitted via BLE, can be used to quickly
      establish a classic Bluetooth connection.  Whereas Desai and Jose provide supporting
      teachings (i.e. specifically, devices extract number='12'device access codes
      from the device addresses to identify the devices [further specificity than
      discussed within Ko], again see Desai, and specifically, paging messages are
      what are used for actually establishing a Bluetooth connection, again see Jose)
      and motivation (i.e. device access codes provide a means for specifically and/or
      precisely identifying the device, again see Desai, and paging messages provide
      a means for actually establishing the Bluetooth connection, again see Jose).\\nThat
      is, a person of ordinary skill would have been able to fit the teachings of
      multiple patents together like pieces of a puzzle.\\\"Id. at 420, 82 USPQ2d
      at 1397.  Also, the test for obviousness is not whether the features of a secondary
      references may be bodily incorporated into the structure of the primary reference;
      nor is it that the claimed invention must be expressly suggested in any one
      or all of the references.  Rather, the test is what the combined teachings of
      the references would have suggested to those of ordinary skill in the art.  See
      In re Keller, 642 F.2d 413, 208 USPQ 871 (CCPA 1981).  In this case, although
      none of the references individually teach the claimed invention, those of ordinary
      skill in the art would have arrived at the claimed invention when considering
      the teachings, suggestions, and/or motivations of the references in combination,
      as outlined above (i.e. since it was known to (1) use BLE to establish classic
      Bluetooth (quicker than conventional classic Bluetooth setup), (2) use a device
      address, and more specifically a device access code, to identify and address
      a specific device (securer method than broadcasting communication since devices
      are communicating directly), and (3) use paging messages to establish a Bluetooth
      connection (necessity of classic Bluetooth connection to get the attention of
      a device number='13'and respond accordingly)).\\n\\nRegarding Claims 1, 6, 11,
      21, and 22, claims 1, 6, 11, 16, 21, and 22 are rejected for the same reason
      as claim 16, as set forth above, since the claims have similar limitations that
      can be met by the same teachings of Ko, Jose, and Desai.  Claims 1, 11, and
      21 being the counterpart device, external device/second device 120.  Additionally,
      where the processor (1240), memory (1250), computer program product (1250),
      and/or non-transitory storage medium (\xB6 [0029]) elements of claims 11 and
      21 are being mapped to the elements of the second device 120 (being the counterpart
      of the first device 100 already described above).\\n\\nRegarding Claim 2, the
      combined teachings of Ko, Jose, and Desai teach or suggest all the limitations
      of the method of claim 1.\\nJose further teaches wherein the device address
      of the apparatus associated with the secure relationship is a unique address
      of the apparatus (\xB6 [0032]).\\nTherefore it would have been obvious to those
      of ordinary skill in the art before the effective filing date of the claimed
      invention to utilize the unique identification number teachings, as taught by
      Jose, with the dual mode communication teachings, as taught by Ko, to arrive
      at the claimed invention.  The motivation to utilize the teachings of Ko and
      Jose together would have been to provide additional security (Jose \xB6 [0032]).\\n\\nnumber='14'Regarding
      Claims 7, 12, and 17, claims 7, 12, and 17 are rejected for the same reason
      as claim 2, as set forth above, since the claims have similar limitations that
      can be met by the same teachings of Ko, Jose, and Desai.\\n\\nRegarding Claim
      3, the combined teachings of Ko, Jose, and Desai teach or suggest all the limitations
      of the method of claim 1.  Ko further teaches wherein the first wireless carrier
      is Bluetooth Low Energy protocol (\xB6 [0221]).\\n\\nRegarding Claims 8, 13,
      and 18, claims 8, 13, and 18 are rejected for the same reason as claim 3, as
      set forth above, since the claims have similar limitations that can be met by
      the same teachings of Ko, Jose, and Desai.\\n\\nRegarding Claim 4, the combined
      teachings of Ko, Jose, and Desai teach or suggest all the limitations of the
      method of claim 1.\\nWhile Ko does teach wherein the second wireless carrier
      is Bluetooth basic rate/enhanced data rate protocol (\xB6 [0099] and [0184],
      i.e. classic Bluetooth [also referred in the art as basic rate/enhanced data
      rate (BR/EDR)]), Ko does not explicitly disclose the wireless paging messages
      are Bluetooth basic rate/enhanced data rate paging packets.\\nJose further teaches
      classic Bluetooth [also referred in the art as basic rate/enhanced data rate
      (BR/EDR)] mode when communicating with a hub device (and exchanging paging packets
      with the at least one hub (\xB6 [0009], [0031], and [0044]).  number='15'That
      is, the paging packets in this embodiment are performed through classic Bluetooth
      [also referred in the art as basic rate/enhanced data rate (BR/EDR)].\\nTherefore
      it would have been obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art before the
      effective filing date of the claimed invention to utilize the classic Bluetooth
      paging packet teachings, as taught by Jose, with the dual mode communication
      teachings, as taught by Ko, to arrive at the claimed invention.  The motivation
      to utilize the teachings of Ko and Jose together would have been to establish
      a Bluetooth connection using a paging signals (Jose \xB6 [0044]).\\n\\nRegarding
      Claims 9, 14, and 19, claims 9, 14, and 19 are rejected for the same reason
      as claim 4, as set forth above, since the claims have similar limitations that
      can be met by the same teachings of Ko, Jose, and Desai.\\n\\nRegarding Claim
      5, the combined teachings of Ko, Jose, and Desai teach or suggest all the limitations
      of the method of claim 3.\\nThe difference between the claimed invention and
      the combination of Ko and Jose is that neither Ko nor Jose teach wherein the
      device address of the apparatus associated with the secure relationship is a
      48-bit Bluetooth device address.\\nHowever Desai further teaches the device
      identity information may comprise non-private device identity such as 48-bit
      Bluetooth low energy device addresses, and/or private device identity information
      such as Resolvable Private Addresses (RPAs) number='16'and/or Identity Root
      Key (IRK) for concurrent support of privacy and white listing (\xB6 [0014]).\\nTherefore
      it would have been obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art before the
      effective filing date of the claimed invention to utilize the 48-bit BLE address
      teachings, as taught by Desai, with the teachings of Ko and Jose to arrive at
      the claimed invention.  The motivation to utilize the teachings of Ko, Jose,
      and Desai together would have been to utilize a well-known BLE address format
      for identification and/or security (Desai \xB6 [0014]).\\n\\nRegarding Claims
      10, 15, and 20, claims 10, 15, and 20 are rejected for the same reason as claim

      statement of reasons for allowance: The closest prior art is by Kim et al (US
      8,901,081 B2) teach a full length or fragment of a GlyRS and nucleic acid encoding
      the same and fragments thereof that have activity to induce apoptosis of cancer
      cells. One of such nucleic acid encodes SEQ ID NO: 3 a sequence that is 136
      amino acids long and comprises the sequence encoded by the nucleic acid of the
      instant invention (SEQ ID NO: 151- a 65 amino acid sequence) but while the instant
      invention is drawn to a nucleic acid  that encodes a polypeptide consisting
      of  SEQ ID NO: 151 (a 65 amino acid sequence) and/or a sequence comprising a
      substitution of 1, 2 or 3 amino acids from SEQ ID NO: 151, SEQ ID NO: 136 of
      Kim et al consists a longer sequence i.e.  a 136 amino acid residue sequence
      that is encoded by a nucleic acid. Therefore a pharmaceutical composition comprising
      a polynucleotide sequence that encodes the polypeptide consisting of SEQ ID
      NO: 151 or a variant with 1, 2 or 3 amino acid substitutions, deletions and/or
      addition where the polynucleotide is a cDNA or a modified  mRNA polynucleotide
      with less that 10EU endotoxin/mg protein is not anticipated or fairly suggested.

      \ The reference teaches a fuel cell comprising a separator comprising a metal
      sheet (18A, 18B) having projections and recesses inverted from each other forming
      the fluid passages (see Fig. 8).   A seal member (40 or 38; see Fig. 5) is provided

      arguments filed August 22, 2011 have been fully considered but they are not
      persuasive.  Regarding the 35 USC 112 rejection, Applicant urges that claim
      1 is definite since it meets threshold requirements of precision and clarity.
      \ However, the position is maintained that it is not clear from the language
      of claim 1 whether it is the seal member that forms the contour of the manifold
      or the edge side of the separator that forms the contour of the manifold.  More
      particularly, after giving the claim its broadest reasonable interpretation,
      it is submitted that the claim can be interpreted in two ways.  The Supplementary
      Examination Guidelines published in the Federal Register (vo. 70, no. 27, February
      9, 2011, page 7164, section II B) state the following: \u201C[f]or example,
      if the language of a claim, given its broadest reasonable interpretation, is
      such that a person of ordinary skill in the relevant art would read it with
      more than one reasonable interpretation, then a rejection under \xA7 112,  \xB6
      2 is appropriate.\u201D  In view of these supplemental guidelines, the metes
      and bounds of the subject matter of claim 1 are not believed to be clear to
      one of ordinary skill in the art and a rejection under 112 second paragraph
      is appropriate.  Amendment of claim 1 to remove ambiguity and precisely define
      that it is the edge side of the separator that forms the contour of the manifold
      is suggested.\\nApplicant\u2019s argument regarding the second rationale applied
      to claim 1 as well as the argument with respect to claim 2 are persuasive and
      these grounds are withdrawn.\\nThe rejection of claim 7, although not specifically
      addressed, has been reconsidered and withdrawn. \\nWith respect to the rejection
      under 35 USC 102, Applicant asserts that \u201C[h]owever, the \u2018edge side
      of the separator\u2019 in JP \u2018270 is not the \u2018edge side of the separator
      forming the contour of the manifold\u2019 as required by the claims.\u201D  However,
      as set forth in the 35 USC 112 rejection, when the claim limitation is read
      in context, it is not clear that the edge side forms the contour of the manifold,
      and the claim can be reasonably interpreted as reciting that the seal member
      forms the contour of the manifold. Accordingly, given this second interpretation,
      the 35 USC 102 rejection is believed to be proper.  \\n\\nConclusion\\nTHIS
      ACTION IS MADE FINAL.  Applicant is reminded of the extension of time policy
      as set forth in 37 CFR 1.136(a).  \\n\\tA shortened statutory period for reply
      to this final action is set to expire THREE MONTHS from the mailing date of
      this action.  In the event a first reply is filed within TWO MONTHS of the mailing
      date of this final action and the advisory action is not mailed until after
      the end of the THREE-MONTH shortened statutory period, then the shortened statutory
      period will expire on the date the advisory action is mailed, and any extension
      fee pursuant to 37 CFR 1.136(a) will be calculated from the mailing date of
      the advisory action.  In no event, however, will the statutory period for reply
      expire later than SIX MONTHS from the mailing date of this final action.\\n\\tAny

      to monitor available disk space and to throttle back or completely stop usage
      of the application after free disk space decreases below a set threshold [detecting
      a health-risk event and deploying a plug-in in response to resolve said event].

      and security compliance validation program or tools reads the configuration
      file to determine which of the health-check plug-ins or modules stored within

      while judiciously determining a fault detection based on priority information
      associated with each failure.  The RAID system determines a priority of each

      1, further comprising generating a notification associated with detection of
      said health-risk event for communication to an end user of said local machine.Durrence

      processes are running, and may be able to notify an administrative user in the
      event such processes stop running.\\nAs per claim 5:  The computer-implemented
      method of claim 1, wherein said plug-in is provided for resolving a health-risk
      event representative of an uptime exceeding desired uptime parameters for optimal
      performance of said local machine.Durrence discloses [0046] the system may provide
      basic capabilities for monitoring the overall health of the computers hosting
      the various server components.  Specifically, it is possible to monitor the
      congestion of network interfaces on these systems and throttle-back usage of

      provided for resolving a health-risk event representative of resource use exceeding
      desired allocation parameters for optimal performance of said local machine.Durrence
      discloses [0046] the system may provide basic capabilities for monitoring the

      said plug-in is provided for resolving a health-risk event representative of
      low disk space on said local machine.Durrence further discloses [0046] it is
      also possible to monitor available disk space and to throttle back or completely
      stop usage of the application after free disk space decreases below a set threshold.\\n
      As per claim 9:  Although claim 9 is directed towards a system claim, it is
      rejected under the same rationale as the method claim 1 above.\\n As per claim

      identifies a required action, and a time period for executing said required
      action, to resolve said detected health-risk event. \\nDurrence, Kline, and
      Tucek disclose notifying a user, but fail to explicitly disclose identifying
      a required action to resolve said health-risk event.  Raghuraman discloses a
      similar method, which further teaches [Fig. 7; 0064-0067] a user alert is generated
      in response to hostile conditions.  Then, a determination is made as to whether
      a user response to the alert is expected [time period set for user to respond].
      \ If no response is received, the operating system can direct the appropriate
      response based upon available policies and information.  If a user response
      is detected, the selected response can be initiated to prevent failure of the
      disk and/or mitigate the loss of data.\\nIt would have been obvious to one of
      ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to modify the teachings
      of Durrence, Kline, and Tucek with that of Raghuraman.  One would have been
      motivated to send a notification that requires an action and a time period for
      executing said action because it allows the system to prevent failure of the
      disk [Raghuraman; 0066].\\nAs per claim 4:  The computer-implemented method
      of claim 3, wherein said plug-in for resolving said detected health-risk event
      is deployed after expiration of said time period forexecuting said required
      action.Raghuraman discloses [Fig. 7; 0064-0067] a user alert is generated in
      response to hostile conditions.  Then, a determination is made as to whether
      a user response to the alert is expected [time period set for user to respond].

      claims 12 and 13 are directed towards a system claim, they are rejected under
      the same rationale as the method claims, 3 and 4, respectively.\\n Claims 8
      and 17 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Durrence
      in view of Kline and further in view of Tucek and further in view of Sample
      (US 2008/0133749 A1).\\nAs per claim 8:  The computer-implemented method of
      claim 1, further comprising reportinginformation associated with detection and
      resolution of said health-risk event to a regional  zone machine communicatively
      coupled to said local machine, said regional zone machine configured to provide
      support to monitoring of said health status of said local machine. \\nDurrence,
      Kline, and Tucek disclose the method of claim 1, but fail to explicitly disclose
      reporting health-risk event to a regional zone machine to provide support for
      monitoring.  Sample discloses a similar method, which further teaches [Fig.
      5 and 6; 0037-0042] a console computer provides support to multiple host computers.
      \ Each of the host components may operate to transmit information relating to
      their generated alerts.  Operators local to console component may view the alert
      information and manage threshold settings for the host components.\\nIt would
      have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention
      to modify the teachings of Durrence, Kline, and Tucek with that of Sample.  One
      would have been motivated to provide support from a regional zone machine because
      it can help alert users about possible attacks [Sample; 0041].\\n As per claim
      17:  Although claim 17 is directed towards a system claim, it is rejected under
      the same rationale as the method claim 8 above.\\n\"],\n        \"sections.submissionDate\":\"2015-12-03T05:00:00Z\",\n

      associated with each failure.  The RAID system determines a priority of each
      detected failure.  Thus, if two  failures occur simultaneously, the RAID system
      performs a recovery based on the determined highest priority failure.\\nIt would
      have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention
      to modify the teachings of Durrence and Kline with that of Tucek.  One would
      have been motivated to determine a priority of said health-risk event because
      it allows the system to perform a recovery based on the highest priority failure
      [Tucek; 0032]. \\n   \\nAs per claim 2:  The computer-implemented method of
      claim 1, further comprising generating a notification associated with detection
      of said health-risk event for communication to an end user of said local machine.Durrence
      discloses [0046] the system can monitor host platforms to ensure that critical
      processes are running, and may be able to notify an administrative user in the
      event such processes stop running.\\n\\nAs per claim 5:  The computer-implemented
      method of claim 1, wherein said plug-in is provided for resolving a health-risk
      event representative of an uptime exceeding desired uptime parameters for optimal
      performance of said local machine.Durrence discloses [0046] the system may provide
      basic capabilities for monitoring the overall health of the computers hosting
      the various server components.  Specifically, it is possible to monitor the
      congestion of network interfaces on these systems and throttle-back usage of
      the system when the network interface passes a defined threshold.\\n\\n As per
      claim 6:  The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein said plug-in is
      provided for resolving a health-risk event representative of resource use exceeding
      desired allocation parameters for optimal performance of said local machine.Durrence
      discloses [0046] the system may provide basic capabilities for monitoring the
      overall health of the computers hosting the various server components.  Specifically,
      it is possible to monitor the congestion of network interfaces on these systems
      and throttle-back usage of the system when the network interface passes a defined
      threshold.\\n\\nAs per claim 7:  The computer-implemented method of claim 1,
      wherein said plug-in is provided for resolving a health-risk event representative
      of low disk space on said local machine.Durrence further discloses [0046] it
      is also possible to monitor available disk space and to throttle back or completely
      stop usage of the application after free disk space decreases below a set threshold.\\n\\nAs
      per claim 9:  Although claim 9 is directed towards a system claim, it is rejected
      under the same rationale as the method claim 1 above.\\n\\nAs per claim 10:
      \ Although claim 10 is directed towards a computer-readable storage medium claim,
      it is rejected under the same rationale as the method claim 1 above.\\n\\n As
      per claims 11 and 14-16:  Although claims 11 and 14-16 are directed towards
      a system claim, they are rejected under the same rationale as method claims,
      2 and 5-7, respectively.\\n\\nClaims 3, 4, 12, and 13 are rejected under 35
      U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Durrence in view of Kline and further
      in view of Tucek and further in view of Raghuraman et al. (US 2008/0189578 A1).\\n\\nAs
      per claim 3:  The computer-implemented method of claim 2, wherein said notification
      identifies a required action, and a time period for executing said required
      action, to resolve said detected health-risk event. \\nDurrence, Kline, and
      Tucek disclose notifying a user, but fail to explicitly disclose identifying
      a required action to resolve said health-risk event.  Raghuraman discloses a
      similar method, which further teaches [Fig. 7; 0064-0067] a user alert is generated
      in response to hostile conditions.  Then, a determination is made as to whether
      a user response to the alert is expected [time period set for user to respond].
      \ If no response is received, the operating system can direct the appropriate
      response based upon available policies and information.  If a user response
      is detected, the selected response can be initiated to prevent failure of the
      disk and/or mitigate the loss of data.\\nIt would have been obvious to one of
      ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to modify the teachings
      of Durrence, Kline, and Tucek with that of Raghuraman.  One would have been
      motivated to send a notification that requires an action and a time period for
      executing said action because it allows the system to prevent failure of the
      disk [Raghuraman; 0066].\\n\\nAs per claim 4:  The computer-implemented method
      of claim 3, wherein said plug-in for resolving said detected health-risk event
      is deployed after expiration of said time period forexecuting said required
      action.Raghuraman discloses [Fig. 7; 0064-0067] a user alert is generated in
      response to hostile conditions.  Then, a determination is made as to whether
      a user response to the alert is expected [time period set for user to respond].
      \ If no response is received, the operating system can direct the appropriate
      response based upon available policies and information.  If a user response
      is detected, the selected response can be initiated to prevent failure of the
      disk and/or mitigate the loss of data.\\n\\nAs per claims 12 and 13:  Although
      claims 12 and 13 are directed towards a system claim, they are rejected under
      the same rationale as the method claims, 3 and 4, respectively.\\n\\nClaims
      8 and 17 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Durrence
      in view of Kline and further in view of Tucek and further in view of Sample
      (US 2008/0133749 A1).\\n\\nAs per claim 8:  The computer-implemented method
      of claim 1, further comprising reportinginformation associated with detection
      and resolution of said health-risk event to a regional  zone machine communicatively
      coupled to said local machine, said regional zone machine configured to provide
      support to monitoring of said health status of said local machine. \\nDurrence,
      Kline, and Tucek disclose the method of claim 1, but fail to explicitly disclose
      reporting health-risk event to a regional zone machine to provide support for
      monitoring.  Sample discloses a similar method, which further teaches [Fig.
      5 and 6; 0037-0042] a console computer provides support to multiple host computers.
      \ Each of the host components may operate to transmit information relating to
      their generated alerts.  Operators local to console component may view the alert
      information and manage threshold settings for the host components.\\nIt would
      have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention
      to modify the teachings of Durrence, Kline, and Tucek with that of Sample.  One
      would have been motivated to provide support from a regional zone machine because
      it can help alert users about possible attacks [Sample; 0041].\\n\\nAs per claim
      17:  Although claim 17 is directed towards a system claim, it is rejected under
      the same rationale as the method claim 8 above.\\n\\nResponse to Arguments\\nIn
      response to applicant\u2019s argument that the combination of Durrence and Kline
      fail to disclose or suggest a \u201Cplug-in\u201D the examiner respectfully
      disagrees.  Kline explicitly discloses a similar method, which further teaches
      [Fig. 2; 0024] in response to the inventory results obtained from the execution,
      the audit and security compliance validation program or tools reads the  configuration
      file to determine which of the health-check plug-ins or modules stored within
      the module library should be executed.  A health-check plug-in or module is
      only executed for an application determined to be installed or running on the
      target system.  In other words, if a particular application is not installed
      or found running on a system, then the corresponding health-check plug-in or
      module for determining compliance is not executed on the system.\\nIn response
      to applicant\u2019s argument that there is no disclosure in either Durrence
      or Kline that \\\"...the plug-ins is identified from a plurality of plug-ins
      based on at least one attribute of the machine...\\\" the examiner respectfully
      disagrees.  Kline discloses [0024] the audit and security compliance validation
      program or tools reads the configuration file to determine which of the health-check
      plug-ins or modules stored within the module library should be executed [identifying
      plug-ins from a plurality of plug-ins].  A health-check plug-in or module is
      only executed for an application determined to be installed or running on the
      target system [health-check plug-in executed based on at least one attribute
      of said system (attribute being that the application is installed or running
      on the target system)].\\nIn response to applicant\u2019s argument that there
      is no disclosure in either Durrence, Kline, and Tucek fail to disclose or suggest
      \\\"...identifying at least one current threshold value associated with operation
      of said machine, wherein said current threshold value is based on at least one
      attribute of said machine...\\\" the examiner respectfully disagrees.  Durrence
      discloses [0046] it is also possible to monitor available disk space and to
      throttle back or completely stop usage of the application after free disk space
      decreases below a set threshold [detecting a health-risk event and deploying
      a plug-in in response to resolve said event].  It is clear that the threshold
      value is  based on at least one attribute of the system [threshold based on
      available disk space of the machine].\\nIn response to applicant's argument
      that the references fail to show certain features of applicant\u2019s invention,
      it is noted that the features upon which applicant relies (i.e., threshold values
      associated with a client machine may be determined based on the regional zone
      of the client machine, desired monitoring requirements for a select group of
      end users, frequently occurring health-risk events, past usage statistics, or
      any combination thereof) are not recited in the rejected claim(s).  Although
      the claims are interpreted in light of the specification, limitations from the
      specification are not read into the claims.  See In re Van Geuns, 988 F.2d 1181,
      26 USPQ2d 1057 (Fed. Cir. 1993).  The examiner recommends explicitly amending
      the claims with features described in the argument to overcome the cited references.\\n\\nConclusion\\nApplicant's
      amendment necessitated the new ground(s) of rejection presented in this Office
      action.  Accordingly, THIS ACTION IS MADE FINAL.  See MPEP \xA7 706.07(a).  Applicant
      is reminded of the extension of time policy as set forth in 37 CFR 1.136(a).
      \ \\nA shortened statutory period for reply to this final action is set to expire

      per claims 1 and 14-16, Dyke teaches a non-transitory storage medium, device,
      system, and method having stored therein an information processing program that
      when executed by at least one processor (abstract and Figs. 1-2, item 54 see
      gaming console), causes the at least one processor to provide execution comprising:
      receive input by a player (Fig. 6C and col. 9, lines 25-41 see game player input
      which is received, via game controllers (Figs. 1-2, items 52a and 52b and col.
      3, lines 7-50 which describes the system and controllers)  to cause a change);
      change an object to serve as an operated object between a first object and a
      second object among objects in a virtual space (Fig. 6C, col. 1, lines 46-67,
      and col. 9, lines 25-41 player is allowed to input a command to possess, or
      take over, an NPC character, which is the second object, to control when the
      player is in ghost form, which is the first object, and to switch back as needed),
      the operated object being operated in response to the input (Figs. 7B-7G, col.
      8, lines 3-23, and col. 10, lines 17-67 describes action, including specific
      and different actions related to the type of character possessed such as a guard
      sprinting or a dog jumping, which a player can carry out while in control of
      the object); control the second object using a first control method while the
      second object does not serve as the operated object (col. 8, line 51 to col.
      9, line 3 describes various actions that a character, or object, is carrying
      out prior to be possessed and having control shift to a player); and control
      the second object using a second control method different from the first control
      method during a period (Figs. 7B-7G, col. 8, lines 3-23, and col. 10, lines
      17-67 describes  action, including specific and different actions related to
      the type of character possessed such as a guard sprinting or a dog jumping,
      which a player can carry out while in control of the object) until a predetermined
      condition is satisfied after an object to serve as the operated object is changed
      from the second object to the first object (Fig. 7B and col. 10, lines 26-30
      see dispossess to switch from the controlled object back to the ghost character).
      \ Dyke does not specifically teach a second control method that includes preventing
      the second object from moving position, until a predetermined condition associated
      with a period of time is satisfied after an object to serve as the operated
      object is changed from the second object to the first object.  However, Messiah
      teaches an electronic game (page 6, see instructions for installing and starting
      game which comprises a computer to operate the game) comprising an avatar controlled
      by the player which moves within the game environment (pages 11-15, see movement
      instructions) wherein the avatar is able to possess a second object within the
      game (page 16, see possession) in order to control the second object (pages
      16-18 see details of possession) wherein the avatar may depossess a second object
      wherein the second object is prevented from moving for a period of time until
      a predetermined time condition is met (page 16, second paragraph the host is
      stunned for a few moments before returning to normal behavior).  Hence, it would
      have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of filing
      to have combined the teachings of Dyke with Messiah, since the action of stunning,
      or preventing movement, of the second object will allow a player controlled
      primary object, such as a player character, time to leave the previously possessed
      object without penalty such as the second object attacking the first object
      (Messiah page 16, second paragraph).\\nAs per claim 2, Dyke teaches a medium
      the information processing program further causing the at least one processor
      to provide execution comprising display the first object while the first object
      serves as the operated object and hide the first object while the second object
      serves as the operated object (Figs. 7A-7B, items 704 and 726 and col. 10, lines
      11-16 and 32-36 displays the character in the  lower portion of the screen depending
      on which object is in control.  Specifically a first object, the ghost, is displayed
      until a second object, the NPC, is possessed).\\nAs per claim 3, Dyke teaches
      a medium the information processing program further causing the at least one
      processor to provide execution arrange the first object in a vicinity of the
      second object when an object to serve as the operated object is changed from
      the second object to the first object (Fig. 6C and col. 9, lines 25-38 when
      the act of possessing occurs the ghost character is within the vicinity of the
      possessed target, as shown by the figure the same room, and it\u2019s clear
      that the ghost is intended to be within the characters after possession (see
      Figs. 7B-7D as examples)).\\nAs per claim 5, Dyke teaches a medium wherein the
      first control method includes control to move the second object such that the
      second object approaches the first object (col. 8, line 51 to col. 9, line 3
      describes various actions that a character, or object, is carrying out prior
      to be possessed and having control shift to a player which would include moving
      towards a player, represented by a ghost, depending where the player positions
      their character).\\nAs per claim 7, Dyke does not specifically teach a medium
      wherein the first control method includes control to cause the second object
      to attack the first object and the second control method includes control to
      stop an attack to the first object by the second object.  However, Messiah teaches
      an electronic game (page 6, see instructions for installing and starting game
      which comprises a computer to operate the game) comprising an avatar controlled
      by the player which moves within the game environment (pages 11-15, see movement
      instructions) wherein the avatar is able to possess a second object within the
      game (page 16, see possession) in order to control the second object (pages
      16-18 see details of possession) wherein the avatar may depossess a second object
      wherein the second object is prevented from moving for a period of time until
      a predetermined time condition is met thereby preventing attack (page 16, second
      paragraph the host is stunned for a few moments before returning to normal behavior).
      \ Hence, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the
      time of  filing to have combined the teachings of Dyke with Messiah, since the
      action of stunning, or preventing movement, of the second object will allow
      a player controlled primary object, such as a player character, time to leave
      the previously possessed object without penalty such as the second object attacking
      the first object (Messiah page 16, second paragraph).\\nAs per claim 8, Dyke
      does not specifically teach a medium wherein the first control method includes
      control to do damage to the first object in a case where the first object makes
      contact with the second object and the second control method includes control
      not to do damage to the first object in a case where the first object makes
      contact with the second object.  However, Messiah teaches an electronic game
      (page 6, see instructions for installing and starting game which comprises a
      computer to operate the game) comprising an avatar controlled by the player
      which moves within the game environment (pages 11-15, see movement instructions)

      16, see possession) in order to control the second object and use the second
      object as defense against other objects including second objects (pages 16-18

      the previously possessed object without penalty such as the second object attacking
      the first object (Messiah page 16, second paragraph).\\nAs per claim 9, Dyke
      teaches a medium wherein the first control method includes control to arrange
      the second object at a predetermined position in the virtual space (col. 8,
      line 51 to col. 9, line 3 object is controlled based on actions within the environment
      such as moving towards a door to escape a  room) and the second control method
      includes control to arrange the second object at a position of the second object
      \ or in a vicinity of the position (Figs. 7B-7G, col. 8, lines 3-23, and col.
      10, lines 17-67 player can move around a second object and the second object
      will be positioned where the second object is at that time) where an object
      to serve as the operated object is changed from the second object to the first
      object (Fig. 7B and col. 10, lines 26-30 see dispossess to switch from the controlled
      object back to the ghost character including when the second object is at a
      location).\\nAs per claim 12, Dyke teaches a medium wherein, the information
      processing program further causes the at least one processor to provide execution
      comprising, while the second object serves as the operated object, place the
      second object into a state visually distinguishable from while not serving as
      the operated object (Figs. 7B-7D see various changes to the screen including
      input guides and the lower screen to display the second object which occur when
      the second object is being controlled).\\nAs per claim 13, Dyke does not specifically
      teach wherein the information processing program further causes the at least
      one processor to provide execution comprising control the second object using
      the first control method after the predetermined condition is satisfied.  However,
      Messiah teaches an electronic game (page 6, see instructions for installing
      and starting game which comprises a computer to operate the game) comprising
      an avatar controlled by the player which moves within the game environment (pages
      11-15, see movement instructions) wherein the avatar is able to possess a second
      object within the game (page 16, see possession) in order to control the second
      object (pages 16-18 see details of possession) wherein the avatar may depossess
      a second object wherein the second object is prevented from moving for a period
      of time until a predetermined time condition is met (page 16, second paragraph
      the host is stunned for a few moments before returning to normal behavior).
      \ Hence, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the
      time of filing to have combined the teachings of Dyke with Messiah, since the
      action of stunning, or preventing movement, of the second object will allow
      a player controlled primary object, such as a player character, time to leave
      \ the previously possessed object without penalty such as the second object
      attacking the first object (Messiah page 16, second paragraph).\\nAs per claim
      17, Dyke does not teach a medium wherein the second control method includes
      disabling movement of the second object for the period of time and then switching
      the second object to the first control method after the period of time elapses.
      \ However, Messiah teaches an electronic game (page 6, see instructions for
      installing and starting game which comprises a computer to operate the game)
      comprising an avatar controlled by the player which moves within the game environment
      (pages 11-15, see movement instructions) wherein the avatar is able to possess
      a second object within the game (page 16, see possession) in order to control
      the second object (pages 16-18 see details of possession) wherein the avatar
      may depossess a second object wherein the second object is prevented from moving
      for a period of time until a predetermined time condition is met wherein normal
      action, see first control method, resumes (page 16, second paragraph the host
      is stunned for a few moments before returning to normal behavior).  Hence, it
      would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of filing
      to have combined the teachings of Dyke with Messiah, since the action of stunning,
      or preventing movement, of the second object will allow a player controlled
      primary object, such as a player character, time to leave the previously possessed
      object without penalty such as the second object attacking the first object
      (Messiah page 16, second paragraph).\\nAs per claim 18, Dyke teaches a medium
      wherein the operated object is operated based on input received by the player
      (Figs. 7B-7G, col. 8, lines 3-23, and col. 10, lines 17-67 describes action,
      including specific and different actions related to the type of character possessed
      such as a guard sprinting or a dog jumping, which a player can carry out while
      in control of the object).\\nAs per claim 19, Dyke teaches a medium wherein
      the second object is controlled, after the second control method, using a third
      control method (examiner interprets this as actions while the operated object
      before player switched to another operated object) based on input received by
      the  player while the second object serves as the operated object (Figs. 7B-7G,
      col. 8, lines 3-23, and col. 10, lines 17-67 describes action, including specific
      and different actions related to the type of character possessed such as a guard
      sprinting or a dog jumping, which a player can carry out while in control of
      the object).\\nAs per claim 20, Dyke teaches a medium wherein the third control
      method includes movement of the second object based on input received by the
      player (Figs. 7B-7G, col. 8, lines 3-23, and col. 10, lines 17-67 describes
      action, including specific and different actions related to the type of character
      possessed such as a guard sprinting or a dog jumping, which a player can carry
      out while in control of the object).  Dyke does not teach a medium when the
      second object changes to the second control method, the second object is prevented
      from moving position for the period of time.  However, Messiah teaches an electronic
      game (page 6, see instructions for installing and starting game which comprises
      a computer to operate the game) comprising an avatar controlled by the player
      which moves within the game environment (pages 11-15, see movement instructions)
      wherein the avatar is able to possess a second object within the game (page
      16, see possession) in order to control the second object (pages 16-18 see details
      of possession) wherein the avatar may depossess a second object wherein the
      second object is prevented from moving for a period of time until a predetermined
      time condition is met wherein normal action, see first control method, resumes
      (page 16, second paragraph the host is stunned for a few moments before returning
      to normal behavior).  Hence, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill
      in the art at the time of filing to have combined the teachings of Dyke with
      Messiah, since the action of stunning, or preventing movement, of the second
      object will allow a player controlled primary object, such as a player character,
      time to leave the previously possessed object without penalty such as the second
      object attacking the first object (Messiah page 16, second paragraph).\\n Claim
      6 and 10-11 is/are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable over Dyke

      in view of \\\"Enemy Mind\\\" Game from Schell Games (Video published 9/25/2014
      see link in notice of references cited for the full video)(hereinafter referred
      to as Enemy Mind).\\nAs per claim 6, Dyke does not specifically teach a medium
      wherein the first control method includes control to move the second object
      such that the second object goes away from the first object.  However, Enemy
      Mind teaches a game (pages 1-2 see game descriptions) wherein players can transfer
      from one object to another by firing upon an attacking enemy object (pages 7-11
      see screen captures from the trailer).  Hence, it would have been obvious to
      one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of effective filing to have combined
      the teachings of Dyke with Messiah and Enemy Mind, since Dyke is modifiable
      to include a plurality of game features regarding the act of possessing an NPC
      character including actions wherein consciousness, see control in Enemy Mind,
      is passed from one object to another in order to allow an attacking object to
      be taken over and abandon a previous object as the player advances which allows
      for a unique way to overcome an enemy and to increase the possible actions of
      a player by allowing them to switch to different objects which are controlled
      in different ways.\\n  As per claim 10, Dyke does not specifically teach a medium
      wherein the information processing program further causes the at least one processor
      to provide execution comprising change an object to serve as the operated object
      from the first object to the second object when a third object discharged from
      the first object serving as the operated object hits the second object.  However,
      Enemy Mind teaches a game (pages 1-2 see game descriptions) wherein players
      can transfer from one object to another by firing upon an attacking enemy object
      (pages 7-11 see screen captures from the trailer).  Hence, it would have been
      obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of effective filing
      to have  combined the teachings of Dyke with Messiah and Enemy Mind, since Dyke
      is modifiable to include a plurality of game features regarding the act of possessing
      an NPC character including actions wherein consciousness, see control in Enemy
      Mind, is passed from one object to another in order to allow an attacking object
      to be taken over, thereby stopping an attack on the first object instead of
      being hit and destroyed, and abandon a previous object as the player advances
      which allows for a unique way to overcome an enemy and to increase the possible
      actions of a player by allowing them to switch to different objects which are
      controlled in different ways.\\nAs per claim 11, Dyke does not specifically
      teach a method wherein the information processing program further causes the
      at least one processor to provide execution comprising allow to change an object
      to serve as the operated object from the first object to the second object during
      a period until a predetermined condition is satisfied after an object to serve
      as the operated object is changed from the second object to the first object.
      \ However, Enemy Mind teaches a game (pages 1-2 see game descriptions) wherein
      players can transfer from one object to another by firing upon an attacking
      enemy object (pages 7-11 see screen captures from the trailer).  Hence, it would
      have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of effective
      filing to have combined the teachings of Dyke with Messiah and Enemy Mind, since
      Dyke is modifiable to include a plurality of game features regarding the act
      of possessing an NPC character including actions wherein consciousness, see
      control in Enemy Mind, is passed from one object to another in order to allow
      an attacking object to be taken over, thereby stopping an attack on the first
      object instead of being hit and destroyed, and abandon a previous object as
      the player advances which allows for a unique way to overcome an enemy and to
      increase the possible actions of a player by allowing them to switch to different
      objects which are controlled in different ways.  Additionally, it is an obvious
      feature to allow for an object to be repossessed if the player finds the action
      useful and the object is still present.\\nResponse to Argumentsnumber='10'\\nApplicant\u2019s
      arguments with respect to claims 1-20 have been considered but are moot because
      the arguments do not apply to any of the references being used in the current
      rejection.  Applicant has amended the independent claims to clarify the feature
      of the second control method upon cessation of control of an operated object
      to include preventing movement.  See Messiah which addresses this feature.  Examiner
      has also modified rejections for dependent claims whose scopes have changed
      accordingly based on the additional features.  Examiner notes that both Dyke
      and Messiah are drawn to games concerning a player object, such as a character
      avatar, taking control of a second object, such as a NPC or enemy, wherein this
      feature is a main focus of the games.  Therefore examiner finds these to be
      related art and therefore the same motivations for actions, such as stunning
      enemy objects on switching control, would apply.  See above.\\n\"],\n        \"sections.submissionDate\":\"2019-10-09T04:00:00Z\",\n

      rejections set forth in this Office action:\\nA patent for a claimed invention
      may not be obtained, notwithstanding that the claimed invention is not identically
      disclosed as set forth in section 102, if the differences between the claimed
      invention and the prior art are such that the claimed invention as a whole would
      have been obvious before the effective filing date of the claimed invention
      to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which the claimed invention
      pertains. Patentability shall not be negated by the manner in which the invention
      was made.\\n\\nThe factual inquiries set forth in Graham v. John Deere Co.,

      per claims 1 and 14-16, Dyke teaches a non-transitory storage medium, device,
      system, and method having stored therein an information processing program that
      when executed by at least one processor (abstract and Figs. 1-2, item 54 see
      gaming console), causes the at least one processor to provide execution comprising:
      receive input by a player (Fig. 6C and col. 9, lines 25-41 see game player input
      which is received, via game controllers (Figs. 1-2, items 52a and 52b and col.
      3, lines 7-50 which describes the system and controllers)  to cause a change);
      change an object to serve as an operated object between a first object and a
      second object among objects in a virtual space (Fig. 6C, col. 1, lines 46-67,
      and col. 9, lines 25-41 player is allowed to input a command to possess, or
      take over, an NPC character, which is the second object, to control when the
      player is in ghost form, which is the first object, and to switch back as needed),
      the operated object being operated in response to the input (Figs. 7B-7G, col.
      8, lines 3-23, and col. 10, lines 17-67 describes action, including specific
      and different actions related to the type of character possessed such as a guard
      sprinting or a dog jumping, which a player can carry out while in control of
      the object); control the second object using a first control method while the
      second object does not serve as the operated object (col. 8, line 51 to col.
      9, line 3 describes various actions that a character, or object, is carrying
      out prior to be possessed and having control shift to a player); and control
      the second object using a second control method different from the first control
      method during a period (Figs. 7B-7G, col. 8, lines 3-23, and col. 10, lines
      17-67 describes  action, including specific and different actions related to
      the type of character possessed such as a guard sprinting or a dog jumping,
      which a player can carry out while in control of the object) until a predetermined
      condition is satisfied after an object to serve as the operated object is changed
      from the second object to the first object (Fig. 7B and col. 10, lines 26-30
      see dispossess to switch from the controlled object back to the ghost character).
      \ Dyke does not specifically teach a second control method that includes preventing
      the second object from moving position, until a predetermined condition associated
      with a period of time is satisfied after an object to serve as the operated
      object is changed from the second object to the first object.  However, Messiah
      teaches an electronic game (page 6, see instructions for installing and starting
      game which comprises a computer to operate the game) comprising an avatar controlled
      by the player which moves within the game environment (pages 11-15, see movement
      instructions) wherein the avatar is able to possess a second object within the
      game (page 16, see possession) in order to control the second object (pages
      16-18 see details of possession) wherein the avatar may depossess a second object
      wherein the second object is prevented from moving for a period of time until
      a predetermined time condition is met (page 16, second paragraph the host is
      stunned for a few moments before returning to normal behavior).  Hence, it would
      have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of filing
      to have combined the teachings of Dyke with Messiah, since the action of stunning,
      or preventing movement, of the second object will allow a player controlled
      primary object, such as a player character, time to leave the previously possessed
      object without penalty such as the second object attacking the first object
      (Messiah page 16, second paragraph).\\nAs per claim 2, Dyke teaches a medium
      the information processing program further causing the at least one processor
      to provide execution comprising display the first object while the first object
      serves as the operated object and hide the first object while the second object
      serves as the operated object (Figs. 7A-7B, items 704 and 726 and col. 10, lines
      11-16 and 32-36 displays the character in the  lower portion of the screen depending
      on which object is in control.  Specifically a first object, the ghost, is displayed
      until a second object, the NPC, is possessed).\\nAs per claim 3, Dyke teaches
      a medium the information processing program further causing the at least one
      processor to provide execution arrange the first object in a vicinity of the
      second object when an object to serve as the operated object is changed from
      the second object to the first object (Fig. 6C and col. 9, lines 25-38 when
      the act of possessing occurs the ghost character is within the vicinity of the
      possessed target, as shown by the figure the same room, and it\u2019s clear
      that the ghost is intended to be within the characters after possession (see
      Figs. 7B-7D as examples)).\\nAs per claim 5, Dyke teaches a medium wherein the
      first control method includes control to move the second object such that the
      second object approaches the first object (col. 8, line 51 to col. 9, line 3
      describes various actions that a character, or object, is carrying out prior
      to be possessed and having control shift to a player which would include moving
      towards a player, represented by a ghost, depending where the player positions
      their character).\\nAs per claim 7, Dyke does not specifically teach a medium
      wherein the first control method includes control to cause the second object
      to attack the first object and the second control method includes control to
      stop an attack to the first object by the second object.  However, Messiah teaches
      an electronic game (page 6, see instructions for installing and starting game
      which comprises a computer to operate the game) comprising an avatar controlled
      by the player which moves within the game environment (pages 11-15, see movement
      instructions) wherein the avatar is able to possess a second object within the
      game (page 16, see possession) in order to control the second object (pages
      16-18 see details of possession) wherein the avatar may depossess a second object
      wherein the second object is prevented from moving for a period of time until
      a predetermined time condition is met thereby preventing attack (page 16, second
      paragraph the host is stunned for a few moments before returning to normal behavior).

      action of stunning, or preventing movement, of the second object will allow
      a player controlled primary object, such as a player character, time to leave
      the previously possessed object without penalty such as the second object attacking
      the first object (Messiah page 16, second paragraph).\\nAs per claim 8, Dyke
      does not specifically teach a medium wherein the first control method includes
      control to do damage to the first object in a case where the first object makes
      contact with the second object and the second control method includes control
      not to do damage to the first object in a case where the first object makes
      contact with the second object.  However, Messiah teaches an electronic game
      (page 6, see instructions for installing and starting game which comprises a
      computer to operate the game) comprising an avatar controlled by the player
      which moves within the game environment (pages 11-15, see movement instructions)
      wherein the avatar is able to possess a second object within the game (page
      16, see possession) in order to control the second object and use the second
      object as defense against other objects including second objects (pages 16-18
      see details of possession) wherein the avatar may depossess a second object
      wherein the second object is prevented from moving for a period of time until
      a predetermined time condition is met thereby preventing attack (page 16, second

      \ Hence, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the
      time of filing to have combined the teachings of Dyke with Messiah, since the
      action of stunning, or preventing movement, of the second object will allow
      a player controlled primary object, such as a player character, time to leave
      the previously possessed object without penalty such as the second object attacking
      the first object (Messiah page 16, second paragraph).\\nAs per claim 9, Dyke
      teaches a medium wherein the first control method includes control to arrange
      the second object at a predetermined position in the virtual space (col. 8,
      line 51 to col. 9, line 3 object is controlled based on actions within the environment
      such as moving towards a door to escape a  room) and the second control method
      includes control to arrange the second object at a position of the second object
      \ or in a vicinity of the position (Figs. 7B-7G, col. 8, lines 3-23, and col.
      10, lines 17-67 player can move around a second object and the second object
      will be positioned where the second object is at that time) where an object
      to serve as the operated object is changed from the second object to the first
      object (Fig. 7B and col. 10, lines 26-30 see dispossess to switch from the controlled
      object back to the ghost character including when the second object is at a
      location).\\nAs per claim 12, Dyke teaches a medium wherein, the information
      processing program further causes the at least one processor to provide execution
      comprising, while the second object serves as the operated object, place the
      second object into a state visually distinguishable from while not serving as
      the operated object (Figs. 7B-7D see various changes to the screen including
      input guides and the lower screen to display the second object which occur when
      the second object is being controlled).\\nAs per claim 13, Dyke does not specifically
      teach wherein the information processing program further causes the at least
      one processor to provide execution comprising control the second object using
      the first control method after the predetermined condition is satisfied.  However,
      Messiah teaches an electronic game (page 6, see instructions for installing
      and starting game which comprises a computer to operate the game) comprising
      an avatar controlled by the player which moves within the game environment (pages
      11-15, see movement instructions) wherein the avatar is able to possess a second
      object within the game (page 16, see possession) in order to control the second
      object (pages 16-18 see details of possession) wherein the avatar may depossess
      a second object wherein the second object is prevented from moving for a period
      of time until a predetermined time condition is met (page 16, second paragraph
      the host is stunned for a few moments before returning to normal behavior).
      \ Hence, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the

      a player controlled primary object, such as a player character, time to leave
      \ the previously possessed object without penalty such as the second object
      attacking the first object (Messiah page 16, second paragraph).\\nAs per claim
      17, Dyke does not teach a medium wherein the second control method includes
      disabling movement of the second object for the period of time and then switching
      the second object to the first control method after the period of time elapses.
      \ However, Messiah teaches an electronic game (page 6, see instructions for
      installing and starting game which comprises a computer to operate the game)
      comprising an avatar controlled by the player which moves within the game environment
      (pages 11-15, see movement instructions) wherein the avatar is able to possess
      a second object within the game (page 16, see possession) in order to control
      the second object (pages 16-18 see details of possession) wherein the avatar
      may depossess a second object wherein the second object is prevented from moving
      for a period of time until a predetermined time condition is met wherein normal
      action, see first control method, resumes (page 16, second paragraph the host
      is stunned for a few moments before returning to normal behavior).  Hence, it

      primary object, such as a player character, time to leave the previously possessed
      object without penalty such as the second object attacking the first object
      (Messiah page 16, second paragraph).\\nAs per claim 18, Dyke teaches a medium
      wherein the operated object is operated based on input received by the player
      (Figs. 7B-7G, col. 8, lines 3-23, and col. 10, lines 17-67 describes action,
      including specific and different actions related to the type of character possessed
      such as a guard sprinting or a dog jumping, which a player can carry out while
      in control of the object).\\nAs per claim 19, Dyke teaches a medium wherein
      the second object is controlled, after the second control method, using a third
      control method (examiner interprets this as actions while the operated object
      before player switched to another operated object) based on input received by
      the  player while the second object serves as the operated object (Figs. 7B-7G,
      col. 8, lines 3-23, and col. 10, lines 17-67 describes action, including specific
      and different actions related to the type of character possessed such as a guard
      sprinting or a dog jumping, which a player can carry out while in control of
      the object).\\nAs per claim 20, Dyke teaches a medium wherein the third control
      method includes movement of the second object based on input received by the
      player (Figs. 7B-7G, col. 8, lines 3-23, and col. 10, lines 17-67 describes
      action, including specific and different actions related to the type of character
      possessed such as a guard sprinting or a dog jumping, which a player can carry
      out while in control of the object).  Dyke does not teach a medium when the
      second object changes to the second control method, the second object is prevented
      from moving position for the period of time.  However, Messiah teaches an electronic
      game (page 6, see instructions for installing and starting game which comprises
      a computer to operate the game) comprising an avatar controlled by the player
      which moves within the game environment (pages 11-15, see movement instructions)
      wherein the avatar is able to possess a second object within the game (page
      16, see possession) in order to control the second object (pages 16-18 see details
      of possession) wherein the avatar may depossess a second object wherein the
      second object is prevented from moving for a period of time until a predetermined
      time condition is met wherein normal action, see first control method, resumes
      (page 16, second paragraph the host is stunned for a few moments before returning
      to normal behavior).  Hence, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill

      in view of \\\"Enemy Mind\\\" Game from Schell Games (Video published 9/25/2014
      see link in notice of references cited for the full video)(hereinafter referred
      to as Enemy Mind).\\nAs per claim 6, Dyke does not specifically teach a medium
      wherein the first control method includes control to move the second object
      such that the second object goes away from the first object.  However, Enemy
      Mind teaches a game (pages 1-2 see game descriptions) wherein players can transfer
      from one object to another by firing upon an attacking enemy object (pages 7-11
      see screen captures from the trailer).  Hence, it would have been obvious to
      one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of effective filing to have combined
      the teachings of Dyke with Messiah and Enemy Mind, since Dyke is modifiable
      to include a plurality of game features regarding the act of possessing an NPC
      character including actions wherein consciousness, see control in Enemy Mind,
      is passed from one object to another in order to allow an attacking object to
      be taken over and abandon a previous object as the player advances which allows
      for a unique way to overcome an enemy and to increase the possible actions of
      a player by allowing them to switch to different objects which are controlled
      in different ways.\\n  As per claim 10, Dyke does not specifically teach a medium
      wherein the information processing program further causes the at least one processor
      to provide execution comprising change an object to serve as the operated object
      from the first object to the second object when a third object discharged from
      the first object serving as the operated object hits the second object.  However,
      Enemy Mind teaches a game (pages 1-2 see game descriptions) wherein players
      can transfer from one object to another by firing upon an attacking enemy object
      (pages 7-11 see screen captures from the trailer).  Hence, it would have been
      obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of effective filing

      is modifiable to include a plurality of game features regarding the act of possessing
      an NPC character including actions wherein consciousness, see control in Enemy
      Mind, is passed from one object to another in order to allow an attacking object
      to be taken over, thereby stopping an attack on the first object instead of
      being hit and destroyed, and abandon a previous object as the player advances
      which allows for a unique way to overcome an enemy and to increase the possible
      actions of a player by allowing them to switch to different objects which are
      controlled in different ways.\\nAs per claim 11, Dyke does not specifically
      teach a method wherein the information processing program further causes the
      at least one processor to provide execution comprising allow to change an object
      to serve as the operated object from the first object to the second object during
      a period until a predetermined condition is satisfied after an object to serve
      as the operated object is changed from the second object to the first object.
      \ However, Enemy Mind teaches a game (pages 1-2 see game descriptions) wherein
      players can transfer from one object to another by firing upon an attacking
      enemy object (pages 7-11 see screen captures from the trailer).  Hence, it would

      the player advances which allows for a unique way to overcome an enemy and to
      increase the possible actions of a player by allowing them to switch to different
      objects which are controlled in different ways.  Additionally, it is an obvious
      feature to allow for an object to be repossessed if the player finds the action
      useful and the object is still present.\\nResponse to Argumentsnumber='10'\\nApplicant\u2019s
      arguments with respect to claims 1-20 have been considered but are moot because
      the arguments do not apply to any of the references being used in the current
      rejection.  Applicant has amended the independent claims to clarify the feature
      of the second control method upon cessation of control of an operated object
      to include preventing movement.  See Messiah which addresses this feature.  Examiner
      has also modified rejections for dependent claims whose scopes have changed
      accordingly based on the additional features.  Examiner notes that both Dyke
      and Messiah are drawn to games concerning a player object, such as a character
      avatar, taking control of a second object, such as a NPC or enemy, wherein this
      feature is a main focus of the games.  Therefore examiner finds these to be
      related art and therefore the same motivations for actions, such as stunning
      enemy objects on switching control, would apply.  See above.\\nConclusion\\nTHIS
      ACTION IS MADE FINAL.  Applicant is reminded of the extension of time policy
      as set forth in 37 CFR 1.136(a).  \\nA shortened statutory period for reply
      to this final action is set to expire THREE MONTHS from the mailing date of
      this action.  In the event a first reply is filed within TWO MONTHS of the mailing

      \u201Ca first and second gate pads.\u201D\\nJang discloses \u201Ca first and
      second gate pads ([0055] discloses that scanning signals are sequentially outputted
      to respective gate pads of the lower substrate 11 by the output signal lines
      of the gate driving unit 12).\u201D\\nIt would have been obvious that a person
      of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made would have known
      to substitute the output terminals GOUT of the gate driver disclosed in Kang
      with the gate pads disclosed in Jang because the only difference between the
      claimed invention and the prior art is that the prior art of Kang and Jang does
      not expressly disclose gate pads extending from gate line terminals.  As [0055]
      of Jang teaches that scan signals may be outputted to gate pads and Fig. 8 of
      Kang shows that the output terminals of a gate driver are connected to the terminals
      of gate lines, the substitution would have produced predictable results at the
      time that the invention was made.   \\nAs to claim 2, it is analyzed with regard
      to claim 1.\\nKang (Fig. 8) discloses wherein the first delay compensating transistor
      is responsive to a gate driving voltage that is applied to the second gate line
      (Fig. 8 and [0092] disclose that a first scan signal G1 is transferred through
      a first gate line is discharged to a third voltage VSS2 based on a scan signal
      G2  transferred through the second gate line G2 and applied to QE1), and the
      first delay compensating transistor is configured to apply a delay compensating
      voltage from the delay compensating line to the first gate line (Fig. 8 and
      [0090] disclose that the transistor QE1 defines a discharging path of the scan
      signal that is transferred through G1 by applying VSS2 to G1).\\nAs to claim
      3, it is analyzed with regard to claims 1 and 2.\\nKang (Fig. 8) discloses wherein
      the first delay compensating transistor comprises:\\na first control electrode
      electrically connected to the second gate line (Fig. 8 shows a control electrode
      of QE1 that is electrically connected to G2);\\na first input electrode electrically
      connected to the delay compensating line (Fig. 8 shows an electrode of QE1 that
      is electrically connected to the line with VSS2 to input VSS2); and\\na first
      output electrode electrically connected to the first gate line (Fig. 8 shows
      an electrode of QE1 that is electrically connected to G1 to output VSS2).\\nAs
      to claim 5, it is analyzed with regard to claims 1 and 2.\\nKang (Figs. 1 and
      8) discloses wherein the delay compensating voltage is substantially the same
      as a low-level voltage of the gate driving voltage ([0092] discloses that the
      third voltage VSS2 is smaller than or equal to the first voltage VSS1; [0048]
      discloses that when the second clock signal CKVB is at a high level, the output
      terminal GOUT of the register is at a low level, i.e., the low  level voltage,
      that is the first voltage source VSS, i.e., VSS1; thus, VSS2 may be substantially
      the same as VSS1).\\nAs to claim 6, it is analyzed with regard to claim 1.\\nKang
      (Fig. 8) discloses wherein the display panel further comprises:\\na dummy gate
      line (GD) substantially parallel with the first and second gate lines (Fig.
      8 shows that GD is parallel with G1 and G2); and\\na second delay compensating
      transistor (QEN) electrically connected to the second gate line (the examiner
      notes that GN may be the second gate line of claim 1 and GN-1 may be the first
      gate line of claim 1), the dummy gate line and the delay compensating line (Fig.
      8 shows that QEN is connected to GD, GN, and the line with VSS2).\\nAs to claim
      7, it is analyzed with regard to claims 1 and 6.\\nKang (Fig. 8) discloses \u201Cwherein
      the display panel further comprises a dummy gate\u201D terminal \u201Cextending
      from a first terminal of the dummy gate line ([0089] discloses that each of
      the stages is electrically connected to first terminals of gate lines of the
      cell array circuit 500; Fig. 8 shows that the output terminal of the dummy stage
      is attached to the dummy gate line; thus, the output terminal of the dummy stage
      extends from the dummy gate line).\u201D\\nKang does not expressly disclose
      \u201Ca dummy gate pad.\u201D\\nJang discloses \u201Ca gate pad ([0055] discloses
      that scanning signals are sequentially outputted to respective gate pads of
      the lower substrate 11 by the output signal lines of the gate driving unit 12).\u201D\\n
      \ The combination of Kang and Jang results in the dummy stage outputting the
      gate signal to the dummy gate line GD through the pad disclosed in Jang because
      [0055] of Jang discloses that each output of the gate driving unit is connected
      to a pad.  Thus, the combination of Kang and Jang discloses \u201Ca dummy gate
      pad,\u201D as recited in claim 7.\\nIt would have been obvious that a person
      of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made would have known
      to modify Kang with the features disclosed in Jang for reasons similar to those
      discussed in regard to claim 1.\\nAs to claim 13, it is analyzed with regard
      to claim 1.\\nKang (Fig. 8) discloses wherein a second delay compensating transistor
      (QE2) is electrically connected to a second terminal of the second gate line
      (Fig. 8 shows that QE2 is electrically connected to the end terminal of G2),
      a third gate line (G3) and the delay compensating line (Fig. 8 shows that QE2
      is electrically connected to G3, G2, and the line with VSS2 when a gate pulse
      is sent on G3 for reasons similar to those discussed in regard to claim 1).\\nAs
      to claim 15, it is analyzed with regard to claim 14.\\n Claim 15 recites limitations
      similar to those rejected in regard to claim 1.  Claim 15 differs from claim
      1 in that this claim is directed to the display device depending from claim
      14 and claim 1 is directed to a display panel.  Claim 15 also differs in that
      this claim requires the gate pads to be electrically connected to the gate driving
      part.  However, [0055] of Jang discloses that scanning signals  are sequentially
      outputted to respective gate pads of the lower substrate 11 by the output signal
      lines of the gate driving unit 12.  Thus, Jang teaches gate pads that are electrically
      connected to the gate driving unit 12.  Therefore, claim 15 is rejected for
      the aforementioned reasons and reasons similar to those discussed in regard
      to claims 1 and 14. \\nAs to claim 17, it is analyzed with regard to claim 14.\\n
      Claim 17 recites limitations similar to those rejected in regard to claims 6
      and 7.  Claim 17 differs from claims 6 and 7 in that this claim is directed
      to the display device depending from claim 14 and claims 6 and 7 are directed
      to a display panel.  Claim 17 also differs in that this claim states \u201Cwherein
      the gate driving part is electrically connected to the dummy gate pad and applies
      a dummy gate driving signal to the dummy gate pad.\u201D  As discussed in regard
      to claim 7, Fig. 8 of Kang shows a dummy gate driving part STG-d. Further, [0089]
      of Kang discloses a dummy gate output signal.  Therefore, because Jang discloses
      gate signals output through gate pads, the combination of Kang and  Jang results
      in the gate driving part STG-d being connected to a dummy gate pad.  Therefore,
      claim 17 is rejected for the aforementioned reasons and reasons similar to those
      discussed in regard to claims 1 and 14. \\n Claim 4 is rejected under 35 U.S.C.
      103(a) as being unpatentable over Kang in view of Jang in further view of Lee
      et al. (U.S. Publ. 2010/0039363 A1).\\nAs to claim 4, it is analyzed with regard
      to claims 1 and 2.\\n The combination of Kang and Jang does not expressly disclose
      wherein the gate driving voltage applied to the second gate line is synchronized
      with a falling edge of the gate driving voltage applied to the first gate line.\\nLee
      (Figs. 4 and 6) discloses wherein the gate driving voltage applied to the second
      gate line is synchronized with a falling edge of the gate driving voltage applied
      to the first gate line (Fig. 6 shows that Gout(j+1) applied to G(j+1) is synchronized
      with Gout(j) applied to G(j)).\\nIt would have been obvious that a person of
      ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made would have been
      motivated to modify Kang, as modified by Jang, with the features of Lee for
      reasons similar to those discussed in regard to claim 20.\\n Claim 8 is rejected
      under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Kang in view of Jang in further
      view of Lee in further view of Chang et al. (U.S. Publ. 2011/0316833 A1).\\nAs
      to claim 8, it is analyzed with regard to claim 1.\\nThe combination of Kang
      and Jang does not expressly disclose wherein the delay compensating transistor
      comprises at least one transistor selected from the group consisting of an oxide
      transistor, a low-temperature polycrystalline silicone transistor and a u-crystalline
      transistor.\\nnumber='10'Lee discloses \u201Cwherein the delay compensating

      a u-crystalline transistor ([0048] discloses that T14 may be a polycrystalline
      silicon TFT).\u201D\\nIt would have been obvious that a person of ordinary skill
      in the art at the time the invention was made would have been motivated to modify
      Kang, as modified by Jang, with the features of Lee for reasons similar to those
      discussed in regard to claim 20.\\nLee does not expressly disclose \u201Ca low-temperature
      polycrystalline silicone transistor.\u201D\\nChang discloses \u201Ca low-temperature
      polycrystalline silicone transistor ([0003] discloses using low temperature
      polycrystalline silicon TFTs in the shift register of a gate driver).\u201D\\nIt
      would have been obvious that a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time
      the invention was made would have been motivated to use a low-temperature polycrystalline
      silicone transistors disclosed in Chang for the first and second scan driving
      circuits 510 and 520 of Kang, as modified by Jang and Lee, because [0003] of
      Chang discloses that low temperature polycrystalline silicon TFTs may be used
      in a the gate driver on array (GOA) arrangement such as that described in [0088]
      of Kang to lower costs.  In addition, Lee discloses that at least one transistor
      of the first scan driving circuit, i.e., T2 and the transistor of the second
      scan driving circuit, i.e., T14 may both be polycrystalline silicon TFTs.\\n
      Claim 20 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Kang
      in view of Lee.\\nAs to claim 20, Kang (Fig. 8) discloses an apparatus for compensating
      gate line RC delay in a first gate line (G1) of a pair of gate lines (G1, G2)
      of a display device (Fig. 8; [0093] discloses that an additional discharging
      path using the line with VSS2 is formed at end portions of each of the gate
      lines by QE1, so that a negative influence may be eliminated for the next stage
      because of a delay of scan signal; thus, QE1 is for compensating the delay in
      G1 of the device shown in Fig. 8), the apparatus comprising:\\na delay compensating
      line (Fig. 8 shows a line with VSS2 as a voltage source) configured to provide
      a delay compensating voltage (VSS2; [0093] discloses that an additional discharging
      path using the line with VSS2 is formed at end portions of each of the gate
      lines, so that a negative influence may be eliminated for the next stage because
      of a delay of scan signal); and\\na delay compensating transistor (QE1; QE1
      compensates for delay for the reasons discussed in regard to [0093]) having
      its control electrode coupled to a second gate line of the pair of gate lines,
      its input electrode coupled to the delay compensating line, and its drain electrode
      coupled to the first gate line ([0091] discloses that the transistor QE1 includes
      a source that is electrically connected to an end portion of the first gate
      line, a drain that is electrically connected to a third voltage VSS2 and a gate
      that is electrically number='11'connected to an end portion of the second or
      next gate line; [0091] discloses that QE1 defines a discharging path of the
      scan signal; thus, the drain of QE1 is electrically coupled to G1 and the source
      of QE1 is electrically coupled to VSS2 when the scan signal G2 is applied to
      the gate of QE1),\\nwherein \u201Ca gate driving voltage applied to a second

      through a first gate line, and that the first scan signal G1 is discharged to
      a third voltage VSS2 based on a scan signal G2; thus, G2 and G1 are synchronized),\u201D
      and  \u201Cthe delay compensating transistor applies the delay compensating
      voltage to the first gate line in response to the gate driving voltage being
      applied to the second gate line ([0090] and [0093] disclose that QE1 defines
      a discharging path of the scan signal of G1 using VSS2 based on the scan signal
      G2).\u201D\\nKang does not expressly disclose and\\n\u201Cwherein a rising edge
      of a gate driving voltage applied to a second gate line is synchronized with
      a falling edge of a gate driving voltage applied to the first gate line, such
      that a falling time of the gate driving voltage applied to the first gate line
      is reduced when the delay compensating transistor applies the delay compensating
      voltage.\u201D \\nLee (Figs. 4 and 6) discloses a delay compensating transistor
      (T14) having its control electrode coupled to a second gate line (G(j+1)) of
      the number='12'pair of gate lines (Fig. 4 shows that the gate of T14 is connected
      to G(j+1) of the pair G(j) and G(j+1)), its input electrode coupled to the delay
      compensating line, and its drain electrode coupled to the first gate line ([0048]
      discloses that a source electrode of the fourteenth transistor T14 is connected
      to the power supply terminal GV, and a drain electrode of the fourteenth transistor
      T14 is connected to the j-th gate line Gj), \\nwherein a rising edge of a gate
      driving voltage (Gout(j+1)) applied to a second gate line (Fig. 6 shows a rising
      edge of Gout(j+1) applied to the gate line G(j+1)) is synchronized with a falling
      edge of a gate driving voltage (Gout(j)) applied to the first gate line (Fig.
      6 shows a falling edge of Gout(j) applied to the gate line G(j) and that the
      edges are synchronized), such that a falling time of the gate driving voltage
      applied to the first gate line is reduced when the delay compensating transistor
      applies the delay compensating voltage to the first gate line in response to
      the gate driving voltage being applied to the second gate line ([0068] discloses
      that the pull-down unit 440, i.e., T14, drops the voltage of the gate signal
      Gout(j) to the gate-off voltage Voff, such that the voltage of the gate signal
      Gout(j) may be rapidly pulled down to the gate-off voltage Voff; thus, the falling
      time of Gout(j) is reduced because it is rapidly pulled down to Voff).\\nIt
      would have been obvious that a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time
      the invention was made would have been motivated to modify the scan signals
      of the current gate line and next gate line of Fig. 8 of Kang to be number='13'synchronized
      according to the rising and falling edges of the respective signals as taught
      in Fig. 6 of Lee because [0068] of Lee discloses that the voltage of the current
      gate signal may be rapidly pulled down to the gate-off voltage Voff so as to
      avoid overlap with the next gate signal on the next gate line.\\n\"],\n        \"sections.specificationTitleText\":[\"The

      September 22, 2014 is acknowledged.  The traversal appears to be on the ground(s)
      that claims 1, 9, 14, 15, 17, 18, and 20 are generic.  In response, the Office
      notes that claims 1, 14, and 20 were listed as generic in the Office action

      to withdraw claims 9 and 18 for being directed to a non-elected species, as
      communicated to the Office by Applicants' representative on October 15, 2014.
      In regard to claim 17, the Office disagrees that this claim is generic to all
      species because Species C, as shown in Fig. 8, requires no dummy gate lines.
      \ In regard to claim 15, the Office agrees that this claim is generic to all
      species.  Thus, claims 9-12, 16, 18, and 19 are withdrawn as being directed

      limitations similar to those rejected in regard to claim 1.  Claim 14 differs
      from claim 1 in that this claim is directed to a display device and claim 1
      is directed to display panel.  In addition, claim 14 does not require the first
      and second gate pads of claim 1.  Thus, as claim 14 requires only the features
      disclosed in Kang, as discussed in regard to claim 1, and none of the features
      disclosed in Jang, claim 14 is rejected for reasons similar to those discussed
      in regard to claim 1, as applied to Kang.\\n Further, Kang (Fig. 8) discloses
      a display device (Fig. 8) comprising: \\na gate driving part (510) electrically

      disclosed or described as set forth in section 102 of this title, if the differences
      between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such
      that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention
      was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject
      matter pertains.  Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which
      the invention was made.\\n\\nClaims 1, 2, 5-7, 13, 15, and 17 are rejected under

      (500, 520, and shift register of 510) comprises:\\na base substrate ([0088]
      discloses that the first and second scan driving circuits 510 and 520 are formed
      on the same substrate that is the cell array circuit 500 is formed on);\\na
      first gate line (G1) extending in a first direction on the base substrate (Fig.
      8 shows that G1 extends in a horizontal direction and is formed on the substrate
      described in [0088] because Fig. 8 shows that G1 extends over the cell array
      circuit 500);\\n a second gate line (G2) substantially parallel with the first
      gate line (Fig. 8 shows that G2 is parallel with G1);\\n\u201Ca first and second
      gate\u201D terminals (Gout; [0137] discloses an output terminal GOUT of the
      driving section 130 of a stage of a shift register) \u201Cextending from respective
      first terminals of the first and second gate lines ([0089] discloses that each
      of the stages is electrically connected to first terminals of gate lines of
      the cell array circuit 500; Fig. 8 shows that the output terminals of each stage
      is attached to a gate line; thus, the output terminals of each stage, i.e.,
      Gout, extend from the terminals of each gate line, respectively);\u201D\\na
      data line (D1) extending in a second direction different from the first direction
      (Fig. 8 shows that D1 extends in a vertical direction);\\na delay compensating

      an additional discharging path using the line with VSS2 is formed at end portions
      of each of the gate lines, so that a negative influence may be eliminated for
      the next stage because of a delay of scan signal; thus, the line with VSS2 is
      a delay compensating line) substantially parallel with the data line (Fig. 8
      shows that the line with VSS2 as its voltage source is parallel with D1); and\\na
      first delay compensating transistor (QE1) electrically connected to the first

      portion of the second or next gate line; QE1 is a delay compensating transistor
      for reasons similar to those discussed in regard to the line with VSS).\\nKang
      does not expressly disclose \u201Ca first and second gate pads.\u201D\\nJang
      discloses \u201Ca first and second gate pads ([0055] discloses that scanning
      signals are sequentially outputted to respective gate pads of the lower substrate
      11 by the output signal lines of the gate driving unit 12).\u201D\\nIt would
      have been obvious that a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time the
      invention was made would have known to substitute the output terminals GOUT
      of the gate driver disclosed in Kang with the gate pads disclosed in Jang because
      the only difference between the claimed invention and the prior art is that
      the prior art of Kang and Jang does not expressly disclose gate pads extending
      from gate line terminals.  As [0055] of Jang teaches that scan signals may be
      outputted to gate pads and Fig. 8 of Kang shows that the output terminals of
      a gate driver are connected to the terminals of gate lines, the substitution
      would have produced predictable results at the time that the invention was made.
      \  \\nAs to claim 2, it is analyzed with regard to claim 1.\\nKang (Fig. 8)
      discloses wherein the first delay compensating transistor is responsive to a
      gate driving voltage that is applied to the second gate line (Fig. 8 and [0092]
      disclose that a first scan signal G1 is transferred through a first gate line
      is discharged to a third voltage VSS2 based on a scan signal G2  transferred
      through the second gate line G2 and applied to QE1), and the first delay compensating
      transistor is configured to apply a delay compensating voltage from the delay
      compensating line to the first gate line (Fig. 8 and [0090] disclose that the
      transistor QE1 defines a discharging path of the scan signal that is transferred
      through G1 by applying VSS2 to G1).\\nAs to claim 3, it is analyzed with regard
      to claims 1 and 2.\\nKang (Fig. 8) discloses wherein the first delay compensating
      transistor comprises:\\na first control electrode electrically connected to
      the second gate line (Fig. 8 shows a control electrode of QE1 that is electrically
      connected to G2);\\na first input electrode electrically connected to the delay
      compensating line (Fig. 8 shows an electrode of QE1 that is electrically connected
      to the line with VSS2 to input VSS2); and\\na first output electrode electrically
      connected to the first gate line (Fig. 8 shows an electrode of QE1 that is electrically
      connected to G1 to output VSS2).\\nAs to claim 5, it is analyzed with regard
      to claims 1 and 2.\\nKang (Figs. 1 and 8) discloses wherein the delay compensating
      voltage is substantially the same as a low-level voltage of the gate driving
      voltage ([0092] discloses that the third voltage VSS2 is smaller than or equal
      to the first voltage VSS1; [0048] discloses that when the second clock signal
      CKVB is at a high level, the output terminal GOUT of the register is at a low
      level, i.e., the low  level voltage, that is the first voltage source VSS, i.e.,
      VSS1; thus, VSS2 may be substantially the same as VSS1).\\nAs to claim 6, it
      is analyzed with regard to claim 1.\\nKang (Fig. 8) discloses wherein the display
      panel further comprises:\\na dummy gate line (GD) substantially parallel with
      the first and second gate lines (Fig. 8 shows that GD is parallel with G1 and
      G2); and\\na second delay compensating transistor (QEN) electrically connected
      to the second gate line (the examiner notes that GN may be the second gate line
      of claim 1 and GN-1 may be the first gate line of claim 1), the dummy gate line
      and the delay compensating line (Fig. 8 shows that QEN is connected to GD, GN,
      and the line with VSS2).\\nAs to claim 7, it is analyzed with regard to claims
      1 and 6.\\nKang (Fig. 8) discloses \u201Cwherein the display panel further comprises
      a dummy gate\u201D terminal \u201Cextending from a first terminal of the dummy
      gate line ([0089] discloses that each of the stages is electrically connected
      to first terminals of gate lines of the cell array circuit 500; Fig. 8 shows
      that the output terminal of the dummy stage is attached to the dummy gate line;
      thus, the output terminal of the dummy stage extends from the dummy gate line).\u201D\\nKang
      does not expressly disclose \u201Ca dummy gate pad.\u201D\\nJang discloses \u201Ca
      gate pad ([0055] discloses that scanning signals are sequentially outputted
      to respective gate pads of the lower substrate 11 by the output signal lines
      of the gate driving unit 12).\u201D\\n The combination of Kang and Jang results
      in the dummy stage outputting the gate signal to the dummy gate line GD through
      the pad disclosed in Jang because [0055] of Jang discloses that each output
      of the gate driving unit is connected to a pad.  Thus, the combination of Kang
      and Jang discloses \u201Ca dummy gate pad,\u201D as recited in claim 7.\\nIt
      would have been obvious that a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time
      the invention was made would have known to modify Kang with the features disclosed
      in Jang for reasons similar to those discussed in regard to claim 1.\\nAs to
      claim 13, it is analyzed with regard to claim 1.\\nKang (Fig. 8) discloses wherein
      a second delay compensating transistor (QE2) is electrically connected to a
      second terminal of the second gate line (Fig. 8 shows that QE2 is electrically
      connected to the end terminal of G2), a third gate line (G3) and the delay compensating
      line (Fig. 8 shows that QE2 is electrically connected to G3, G2, and the line
      with VSS2 when a gate pulse is sent on G3 for reasons similar to those discussed
      in regard to claim 1).\\nAs to claim 15, it is analyzed with regard to claim
      14.\\nClaim 15 recites limitations similar to those rejected in regard to claim
      1.  Claim 15 differs from claim 1 in that this claim is directed to the display
      device depending from claim 14 and claim 1 is directed to a display panel.  Claim
      15 also differs in that this claim requires the gate pads to be electrically
      connected to the gate driving part.  However, [0055] of Jang discloses that
      scanning signals  are sequentially outputted to respective gate pads of the
      lower substrate 11 by the output signal lines of the gate driving unit 12.  Thus,
      Jang teaches gate pads that are electrically connected to the gate driving unit
      12.  Therefore, claim 15 is rejected for the aforementioned reasons and reasons
      similar to those discussed in regard to claims 1 and 14. \\nAs to claim 17,
      it is analyzed with regard to claim 14.\\nClaim 17 recites limitations similar
      to those rejected in regard to claims 6 and 7.  Claim 17 differs from claims
      6 and 7 in that this claim is directed to the display device depending from
      claim 14 and claims 6 and 7 are directed to a display panel.  Claim 17 also
      differs in that this claim states \u201Cwherein the gate driving part is electrically
      connected to the dummy gate pad and applies a dummy gate driving signal to the
      dummy gate pad.\u201D  As discussed in regard to claim 7, Fig. 8 of Kang shows
      a dummy gate driving part STG-d. Further, [0089] of Kang discloses a dummy gate
      output signal.  Therefore, because Jang discloses gate signals output through
      gate pads, the combination of Kang and  Jang results in the gate driving part
      STG-d being connected to a dummy gate pad.  Therefore, claim 17 is rejected
      for the aforementioned reasons and reasons similar to those discussed in regard
      to claims 1 and 14. \\n\\nClaim 4 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being
      unpatentable over Kang in view of Jang in further view of Lee et al. (U.S. Publ.
      2010/0039363 A1).\\nAs to claim 4, it is analyzed with regard to claims 1 and
      2.\\n The combination of Kang and Jang does not expressly disclose wherein the
      gate driving voltage applied to the second gate line is synchronized with a
      falling edge of the gate driving voltage applied to the first gate line.\\nLee
      (Figs. 4 and 6) discloses wherein the gate driving voltage applied to the second
      gate line is synchronized with a falling edge of the gate driving voltage applied
      to the first gate line (Fig. 6 shows that Gout(j+1) applied to G(j+1) is synchronized
      with Gout(j) applied to G(j)).\\nIt would have been obvious that a person of
      ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made would have been
      motivated to modify Kang, as modified by Jang, with the features of Lee for
      reasons similar to those discussed in regard to claim 20.\\n\\nClaim 8 is rejected
      under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Kang in view of Jang in further
      view of Lee in further view of Chang et al. (U.S. Publ. 2011/0316833 A1).\\nAs
      to claim 8, it is analyzed with regard to claim 1.\\nThe combination of Kang
      and Jang does not expressly disclose wherein the delay compensating transistor
      comprises at least one transistor selected from the group consisting of an oxide
      transistor, a low-temperature polycrystalline silicone transistor and a u-crystalline
      transistor.\\nnumber='10'Lee discloses \u201Cwherein the delay compensating
      transistor comprises at least one transistor selected from the group consisting
      of an oxide transistor, a\u201D \u201Cpolycrystalline silicone transistor and
      a u-crystalline transistor ([0048] discloses that T14 may be a polycrystalline
      silicon TFT).\u201D\\nIt would have been obvious that a person of ordinary skill
      in the art at the time the invention was made would have been motivated to modify
      Kang, as modified by Jang, with the features of Lee for reasons similar to those
      discussed in regard to claim 20.\\nLee does not expressly disclose \u201Ca low-temperature
      polycrystalline silicone transistor.\u201D\\nChang discloses \u201Ca low-temperature
      polycrystalline silicone transistor ([0003] discloses using low temperature
      polycrystalline silicon TFTs in the shift register of a gate driver).\u201D\\nIt
      would have been obvious that a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time
      the invention was made would have been motivated to use a low-temperature polycrystalline
      silicone transistors disclosed in Chang for the first and second scan driving
      circuits 510 and 520 of Kang, as modified by Jang and Lee, because [0003] of
      Chang discloses that low temperature polycrystalline silicon TFTs may be used
      in a the gate driver on array (GOA) arrangement such as that described in [0088]
      of Kang to lower costs.  In addition, Lee discloses that at least one transistor
      of the first scan driving circuit, i.e., T2 and the transistor of the second
      scan driving circuit, i.e., T14 may both be polycrystalline silicon TFTs.\\n\\nClaim
      20 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Kang in view
      of Lee.\\nAs to claim 20, Kang (Fig. 8) discloses an apparatus for compensating
      gate line RC delay in a first gate line (G1) of a pair of gate lines (G1, G2)
      of a display device (Fig. 8; [0093] discloses that an additional discharging
      path using the line with VSS2 is formed at end portions of each of the gate
      lines by QE1, so that a negative influence may be eliminated for the next stage
      because of a delay of scan signal; thus, QE1 is for compensating the delay in
      G1 of the device shown in Fig. 8), the apparatus comprising:\\na delay compensating
      line (Fig. 8 shows a line with VSS2 as a voltage source) configured to provide
      a delay compensating voltage (VSS2; [0093] discloses that an additional discharging
      path using the line with VSS2 is formed at end portions of each of the gate
      lines, so that a negative influence may be eliminated for the next stage because
      of a delay of scan signal); and\\na delay compensating transistor (QE1; QE1
      compensates for delay for the reasons discussed in regard to [0093]) having
      its control electrode coupled to a second gate line of the pair of gate lines,
      its input electrode coupled to the delay compensating line, and its drain electrode
      coupled to the first gate line ([0091] discloses that the transistor QE1 includes
      a source that is electrically connected to an end portion of the first gate
      line, a drain that is electrically connected to a third voltage VSS2 and a gate
      that is electrically number='11'connected to an end portion of the second or
      next gate line; [0091] discloses that QE1 defines a discharging path of the
      scan signal; thus, the drain of QE1 is electrically coupled to G1 and the source
      of QE1 is electrically coupled to VSS2 when the scan signal G2 is applied to
      the gate of QE1),\\nwherein \u201Ca gate driving voltage applied to a second
      gate line ([0092] discloses a scan signal G2 transferred through the second
      gate line G2) is synchronized with\u201D \u201Ca gate driving voltage applied
      to the first gate line ([0092] discloses a first scan signal G1 transferred
      through a first gate line, and that the first scan signal G1 is discharged to
      a third voltage VSS2 based on a scan signal G2; thus, G2 and G1 are synchronized),\u201D
      and  \u201Cthe delay compensating transistor applies the delay compensating
      voltage to the first gate line in response to the gate driving voltage being
      applied to the second gate line ([0090] and [0093] disclose that QE1 defines
      a discharging path of the scan signal of G1 using VSS2 based on the scan signal
      G2).\u201D\\nKang does not expressly disclose and\\n\u201Cwherein a rising edge
      of a gate driving voltage applied to a second gate line is synchronized with
      a falling edge of a gate driving voltage applied to the first gate line, such
      that a falling time of the gate driving voltage applied to the first gate line
      is reduced when the delay compensating transistor applies the delay compensating
      voltage.\u201D \\nLee (Figs. 4 and 6) discloses a delay compensating transistor
      (T14) having its control electrode coupled to a second gate line (G(j+1)) of
      the number='12'pair of gate lines (Fig. 4 shows that the gate of T14 is connected
      to G(j+1) of the pair G(j) and G(j+1)), its input electrode coupled to the delay
      compensating line, and its drain electrode coupled to the first gate line ([0048]
      discloses that a source electrode of the fourteenth transistor T14 is connected
      to the power supply terminal GV, and a drain electrode of the fourteenth transistor
      T14 is connected to the j-th gate line Gj), \\nwherein a rising edge of a gate
      driving voltage (Gout(j+1)) applied to a second gate line (Fig. 6 shows a rising
      edge of Gout(j+1) applied to the gate line G(j+1)) is synchronized with a falling
      edge of a gate driving voltage (Gout(j)) applied to the first gate line (Fig.
      6 shows a falling edge of Gout(j) applied to the gate line G(j) and that the
      edges are synchronized), such that a falling time of the gate driving voltage
      applied to the first gate line is reduced when the delay compensating transistor
      applies the delay compensating voltage to the first gate line in response to
      the gate driving voltage being applied to the second gate line ([0068] discloses
      that the pull-down unit 440, i.e., T14, drops the voltage of the gate signal
      Gout(j) to the gate-off voltage Voff, such that the voltage of the gate signal
      Gout(j) may be rapidly pulled down to the gate-off voltage Voff; thus, the falling
      time of Gout(j) is reduced because it is rapidly pulled down to Voff).\\nIt
      would have been obvious that a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time
      the invention was made would have been motivated to modify the scan signals
      of the current gate line and next gate line of Fig. 8 of Kang to be number='13'synchronized
      according to the rising and falling edges of the respective signals as taught
      in Fig. 6 of Lee because [0068] of Lee discloses that the voltage of the current
      gate signal may be rapidly pulled down to the gate-off voltage Voff so as to
      avoid overlap with the next gate signal on the next gate line.\\n\\nInquiry\\nAny

      term, and using a plurality of purchases in the purchase history to determine
      a plurality of purchase history search results that include at least some of
      the plurality of web pages are related to the at least one of the plurality
      of purchases (a search is performed using the user search, web index and transaction
      history, see Para. 0166 \u2013 0169, and the transaction history comprises a
      purchase history, see Para. 0116,  and  search results are returned based on
      the user\u2019s transaction history, see Para. 0142).\\nRamer and Kotas are
      analogous due to their disclosure of searching/filtering purchase history.\\nTherefore,
      it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of
      Applicant\u2019s invention to modify Kotas\u2019 use of a searchable purchase
      history database with Ramer\u2019s use of searching a web index using a user
      provided search along with a purchase history in order to provide improved search
      capabilities adapted for use with mobile-communication devices.\\nAs to claim
      2, Kotas modified by Ramer discloses more recent purchases in the plurality
      of purchases are provided more weight in the determining the plurality of purchase
      history search results relative to less recent purchases in the plurality of
      purchases (the user may specify a filter for purchases made in the \\\"last
      X months\\\", which would limit the results to the specified time frame, see
      Para. 0094, purchases outside of the time frame are less recent than those within,
      thereby giving the recent purchases a higher weight than those less recent,
      i.e. outside the timeframe).\\n As to claim 3, Kotas modified by Ramer discloses
      the purchase history is accessed over the network from a plurality of different
      purchase history databases through a plurality of different devices (as the
      result of partnership arrangements with other merchants, the purchase history
      may reflect purchases made from third parties, e.g., from other web sites, online
      stores, physical stores, or other marketplace sellers, see Kotas: Para. 0094,

      a marketplace web site system 515 over a communication network 520, such as
      the Internet 525).\\nAs to claim 5, Kotas modified by Ramer discloses the purchase
      history includes a first purchase and the determining the plurality of purchase
      history search results further comprises:\\ndetermining a superset of search
      term search results, each associated with a web page indexed by the web index,
      using the at least one search term (the user purchase history is maintained
      in a database indexed by ASINs, see Para. 0063 \u2013 0064); and\\ndetermining
      the plurality of purchase history search results using the first purchase, wherein
      the plurality of purchase history search results comprise a subset of the superset
      of search term search results that are related to the first purchase (the user
      may specify a filter for purchases made in the \\\"last X months\\\", which
      would limit the results to the specified time frame, see Para. 0094, the results
      would comprise a first purchase and other purchases made within the specified
      timeframe, which are a subset of all purchases made).\\n As to claim 6, Kotas
      modified by Ramer discloses the purchase history includes a first purchase associated
      with an item, and the determining the plurality of purchase history search results
      further comprises:\\naccessing a search database over the network (the marketplace
      system includes databases for product details and purchase histories that may
      be searched, see Para. 0051 and 0065);\\ndetermining a plurality of previous
      searches associated with the item (related products may be determined by analyzing
      browsing histories to determine other products viewed within the same browsing
      session, see Para. 0105);\\ndetermining the plurality of purchase history search
      results through the association of the item with the plurality of previous searches
      (displayed related products are determined using previous search/browsing histories
      as well as user purchase histories, see Para. 0104 \u2013 0106).\\n Claims 8

      of U.S. Patent No. 8,355,955 issued to Jeetendra Mirchandani et al (hereinafter
      referred to as Mirchandani).\\nAs to claim 4, Kotas modified by Ramer discloses
      the limitations of claim 1 substantially as claimed; however, Kotas modified
      by Ramer does not explicitly disclose providing a plurality of search term search
      results for display on the display device adjacent the plurality of purchase
      history search results, wherein the plurality of search term search results
      include the plurality of web pages that are indexed by the web index and related
      to the at least one search term.\\nMirchandani teaches providing a plurality
      of search term search results for display on the display device adjacent the
      plurality of purchase history search results, wherein the plurality of search
      term search results include the plurality of web pages that are indexed by the
      web index and related to the at least one search term (previous purchases are
      returned adjacent to search results, see Fig. 2A, Customers Who bought this

      ACTION\\nThe present application is being examined under the pre-AIA  first
      to invent provisions. \\nClaims 1 \u2013 20 are pending.\\n\\nResponse to Arguments\\nApplicant
      presents the following arguments in the May 14, 2013 amendment:\\nThe Office
      Action combines the above disclosure in Kotas with Ramer, which teaches user
      transaction history influenced search results (Title.) Para. [0142] teaches
      how a search function may be adapted based on items purchased, with \\\"search
      results retrieved, sorted, presented, or routed based on items purchased by
      a user.\\\" However, there is no disclosure in Ramer of providing a plurality
      of purchase history search results that include the links to the web pages that
      are related to more recent purchases having a prioritized display position relative
      to the links to the web pages that are related to less recent purchases. The
      Office Action states that \\\"Kotas modified by Ramer discloses...wherein more
      recent purchases in the plurality of purchases are provided more weight in the
      determining the plurality of search results relative to less recent purchases
      in the plurality of purchases (the user may specify a filter for purchases made
      in the \\\"last X months\\\", which would limit the results to a specified time
      frame, see para. 8894, purchases outside of the time frame are less recent than
      those within, thereby giving the recent purchases a higher  weight than those
      less recent, i.e., outside the timeframe).\\\" (emphasis in original). The Applicants
      submit that the filtering out of older purchases, while possibly teaching the
      weighing of those purchases differently than newer purchases, would still not
      result in the provision of each of a plurality of purchase history search results
      for display such that links to web pages that are related to more recent purchases
      have a prioritized display position relative to links to web pages that are
      related to less recent purchases (i.e., both links related to more recent purchases
      and links related to less recent purchases are displayed, rather than filtering
      out and not displaying older purchases.)\\nFurthermore, the Applicants also
      submit that no combination of the references teaches providing a plurality of
      search term search results for display adjacent a plurality of purchase history
      search results, as recited by dependent claims 4, 11, and 18. Fig. 6 of the
      present disclosure illustrates the side-by-side display of search term search
      results and purchase history search results, and as stated in para. [0042] of
      the present disclosure, \\\"the web search server 210 is operable to provide
      search results using standard methods as well as using the purchase history
      of the user (and/or other user-specific information), and those search results
      may be displayed separately such that a user may direct their attention to the
      standard search results section 606 when the at least one search term provided
      in block 102 of the method 100 is not related to a purchase, while directing
      attention to the purchase history search results section 608 when the at least
      one search term is related to a purchase.\\\" There simply is no teaching in
      \ either of the references of providing search term search results and purchase
      history search results in such a manner.\\nFurther still, the Office Action
      admits that \\\"Kotas modified by Ramer does not explicitly disclose retrieving
      a calendar of the user from at least one calendar database, wherein the determining
      the plurality of search results includes using the at least one search term,
      the purchase history, and the calendar\\\", but argues that Kurple teaches this
      claim recitation by \\\"(a calendar function records and maintains the consumption
      and purchase of foods over time, see Para. 0013, and keyword searches are used
      with the consumption databases to determine the total foods purchased and consumed
      over a given time, see Para. 0095)\\\", OA at pg. 10. However, amended dependent
      claims 7, 14, and 20 recite that the plurality of search results are determined
      using the at least one search term, the purchase history, and a location included
      in the calendar. Paras. [0038] and [0039] of the present disclosure discuss
      how, for example, a vacation location in a user calendar may be used along with
      a search term and a purchase history to provide search results, and there simply
      is no teaching in any of the references that discusses the use of a location
      in a calendar to provide such a search result.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Examiner presents
      the following responses to Applicant\u2019s arguments:\\nWith respect to applicant\u2019s
      argument A, Applicant's arguments have been fully considered but they are not
      persuasive. Kotas displays in Fig. 4A that the purchase history results are
      sorted by categories (books, music, etc.) and then within the category, they
      purchases are presented by a chronological order (March 2005 then June 2005).
      Applicant\u2019s claim language directed to a \u201Cprioritized display position\u201D
      does not disclose whether the more recent purchases are of a higher priority
      or lower priority, nor does the language clarify whether the top of the screen
      is of higher priority or lower priority or whether priority is sorted left to
      right. Therefore, Fig 4A of Kotas substantially discloses the current claim
      language.\\nWith respect to applicant\u2019s argument B, Applicant\u2019s arguments
      have been considered but are moot because the arguments do not apply to the
      combination of references being used in the current rejection. See rejection
      below.\\nWith respect to applicant\u2019s argument C, Applicant\u2019s arguments
      have been fully considered and are persuasive.  The rejection of claims 7, 14
      and 20 has been withdrawn.  Claims 7, 14 and 20 are objected to as being allowable
      if rewritten in independent form including all of the limitations of the base
      claim and any intervening claims.\\n\\n\\n Allowable Subject Matter\\nClaims
      7, 14 and 20 are objected to as being dependent upon a rejected base claim,
      but would be allowable if rewritten in independent form including all of the
      limitations of the base claim and any intervening claims.\\n\\n\\nClaim Rejections
      - 35 USC \xA7 103\\nThe following is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 103(a) which forms
      the basis for all obviousness rejections set forth in this Office action:\\n(a)
      A patent may not be obtained though the invention is not identically disclosed
      or described as set forth in section 102 of this title, if the differences between
      the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the
      subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention
      was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject
      matter pertains.  Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which
      the invention was made.\\n\\nClaims 1 \u2013 3, 5 - 6, 8 \u2013 10, 12 \u2013
      13, 15 \u2013 17 and 19 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable
      over U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0204449 issued to Paul Kotas
      et al (hereinafter referred to as Kotas) in view of U.S. Patent Application
      Publication No. 2007/0061333 issued to Jorey Ramer et al (hereinafter referred
      to as Ramer).\\nAs to claim 1, Kotas discloses receiving at least one search
      term from a user through an input device (the user specifies filters to limit
      the listed purchases of the purchase history page, see Para. 0094);\\naccessing
      a purchase history for the user from at least one purchase history database
      over a network (the user accesses the purchase history page and specifies filters,
      see Para. 0094); \\n accessing a web index that is located on at least one storage
      device (the information in the various databases of the online marketplace system
      are indexed using ASINs,  the online marketplace system comprises a purchase
      history database, see Para. 0063 \u2013 0064);\\nwherein each of the plurality
      of purchase history search results includes a link to one of the plurality of
      web pages that is related to the at least one of the plurality of purchases
      (the user may specify a filter to limit purchases listed on the purchase history
      page, the results comprise hypertext links to the product pages, see Para. 0094
      \u2013 0095); and \\nproviding the plurality of purchase history search results
      for display on a display device (a list of past purchase are displayed, see
      Para. 0094 - 0095), wherein links to web pages that are related to more recent
      purchases in the plurality of purchases are provided a prioritized display position
      relative to links to web pages that are related to less recent purchases in
      the plurality  of purchases (the purchase history past purchases are listed
      by category (books, music, etc.) and then by chronological order, see Para.
      0094 - 0096 and Fig. 4a, the books are listed in order by order date).\\nHowever,
      Kotas does not explicitly disclose determining a plurality of web pages that
      are indexed by the web index and related to the at least one search term, and
      using a plurality of purchases in the purchase history to determine a plurality
      of purchase history search results that include at least some of the plurality
      of web pages are related to the at least one of the plurality of purchases.\\n
      Ramer teaches determining a plurality of web pages that are indexed by the web
      index and related to the at least one search term, and using a plurality of
      purchases in the purchase history to determine a plurality of purchase history
      search results that include at least some of the plurality of web pages are
      related to the at least one of the plurality of purchases (a search is performed
      using the user search, web index and transaction history, see Para. 0166 \u2013
      0169, and the transaction history comprises a purchase history, see Para. 0116,
      \ and  search results are returned based on the user\u2019s transaction history,
      see Para. 0142).\\nRamer and Kotas are analogous due to their disclosure of
      searching/filtering purchase history.\\nTherefore, it would have been obvious
      to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of Applicant\u2019s invention
      to modify Kotas\u2019 use of a searchable purchase history database with Ramer\u2019s
      use of searching a web index using a user provided search along with a purchase
      history in order to provide improved search capabilities adapted for use with
      mobile-communication devices.\\nAs to claim 2, Kotas modified by Ramer discloses
      more recent purchases in the plurality of purchases are provided more weight
      in the determining the plurality of purchase history search results relative
      to less recent purchases in the plurality of purchases (the user may specify
      a filter for purchases made in the \\\"last X months\\\", which would limit
      the results to the specified time frame, see Para. 0094, purchases outside of
      the time frame are less recent than those within, thereby giving the recent
      purchases a higher weight than those less recent, i.e. outside the timeframe).\\n
      As to claim 3, Kotas modified by Ramer discloses the purchase history is accessed
      over the network from a plurality of different purchase history databases through
      a plurality of different devices (as the result of partnership arrangements
      with other merchants, the purchase history may reflect purchases made from third
      parties, e.g., from other web sites, online stores, physical stores, or other
      marketplace sellers, see Kotas: Para. 0094, and One or more user devices or
      systems 505 (one shown) allow users to access a marketplace web site system
      515 over a communication network 520, such as the Internet 525).\\nAs to claim
      5, Kotas modified by Ramer discloses the purchase history includes a first purchase
      and the determining the plurality of purchase history search results further
      comprises:\\ndetermining a superset of search term search results, each associated
      with a web page indexed by the web index, using the at least one search term
      (the user purchase history is maintained in a database indexed by ASINs, see
      Para. 0063 \u2013 0064); and\\ndetermining the plurality of purchase history
      search results using the first purchase, wherein the plurality of purchase history
      search results comprise a subset of the superset of search term search results
      that are related to the first purchase (the user may specify a filter for purchases
      made in the \\\"last X months\\\", which would limit the results to the specified
      time frame, see Para. 0094, the results would comprise a first purchase and
      other purchases made within the specified timeframe, which are a subset of all
      purchases made).\\n As to claim 6, Kotas modified by Ramer discloses the purchase
      history includes a first purchase associated with an item, and the determining
      the plurality of purchase history search results further comprises:\\naccessing
      a search database over the network (the marketplace system includes databases
      for product details and purchase histories that may be searched, see Para. 0051
      and 0065);\\ndetermining a plurality of previous searches associated with the
      item (related products may be determined by analyzing browsing histories to
      determine other products viewed within the same browsing session, see Para.
      0105);\\ndetermining the plurality of purchase history search results through
      the association of the item with the plurality of previous searches (displayed
      related products are determined using previous search/browsing histories as
      well as user purchase histories, see Para. 0104 \u2013 0106).\\n\\nClaims 8
      \u2013 10 and 12 - 13 are rejected using similar rationale to the rejection
      of claims 1 \u2013 3 and 5 - 6 above.\\nClaims 15 \u2013 17 are rejected using
      similar rationale to the rejection of claim 1 \u2013 3 above.\\nClaim 19 is
      rejected using similar rationale to the rejection of claim 5 above.\\n\\n\\nClaims
      4, 11 and 18 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over
      Kotas and Ramer as applied to claims 1, 8 and 19 above, and in further view
      of U.S. Patent No. 8,355,955 issued to Jeetendra Mirchandani et al (hereinafter
      referred to as Mirchandani).\\nAs to claim 4, Kotas modified by Ramer discloses
      the limitations of claim 1 substantially as claimed; however, Kotas modified
      by Ramer does not explicitly disclose providing a plurality of search term search
      results for display on the display device adjacent the plurality of purchase
      history search results, wherein the plurality of search term search results
      include the plurality of web pages that are indexed by the web index and related
      to the at least one search term.\\nMirchandani teaches providing a plurality
      of search term search results for display on the display device adjacent the
      plurality of purchase history search results, wherein the plurality of search
      term search results include the plurality of web pages that are indexed by the

      \       \"bodyText\":[\"DETAILED ACTION\\nElection/Restriction\\nREQUIREMENT
      FOR UNITY OF INVENTION\\nAs provided in 37 CFR 1.475(a), a national stage application
      shall relate to one invention only or to a group of inventions so linked as
      to form a single general inventive concept (\u201Crequirement of unity of invention\u201D).
      Where a group of inventions is claimed in a national stage application, the
      requirement of unity of invention shall be fulfilled only when there is a technical
      relationship among those inventions involving one or more of the same or corresponding
      special technical features. The expression \u201Cspecial technical features\u201D
      shall mean those technical features that define a contribution which each of
      the claimed inventions, considered as a whole, makes over the prior art.\\nThe
      determination whether a group of inventions is so linked as to form a single
      general inventive concept shall be made without regard to whether the inventions
      are claimed in separate claims or as alternatives within a single claim. See
      37 CFR 1.475(e).\\nWhen Claims Are Directed to Multiple Categories of Inventions:\\nAs
      provided in 37 CFR 1.475 (b), a national stage application containing claims
      to different categories of invention will be considered to have unity of invention
      if the claims are drawn only to one of the following combinations of categories:\\n(1)
      A product and a process specially adapted for the manufacture of said product;
      or\\n(2) A product and a process of use of said product; or\\n(3) A product,
      a process specially adapted for the manufacture of the said product, and a use
      of the said product; or\\n (4) A process and an apparatus or means specifically
      designed for carrying out the said process; or\\n(5) A product, a process specially
      adapted for the manufacture of the said product, and an apparatus or means specifically
      designed for carrying out the said process.\\nOtherwise, unity of invention
      might not be present. See 37 CFR 1.475 (c).\\nRestriction is required under
      35 U.S.C. 121 and 372.\\nThis application contains the following inventions
      or groups of inventions which are not so linked as to form a single general
      inventive concept under PCT Rule 13.1. \\nIn accordance with 37 CFR 1.499, applicant
      is required, in reply to this action, to elect a single invention to which the
      claims must be restricted.\\nGroup I, claim(s) 1 and 3-11, drawn to a method
      of purifying peptides and/or polypeptides.\\nGroup II, claim(s) 2, drawn to
      a method of purifying peptides and/or polypeptides bound to mixed-phase SPE
      material.\\nGroup III, claim(s) 12 and 14, drawn to use of an organic solvent.\\nGroup
      IV, claim(s) 13 and 15, drawn to a kit.\\nThe groups of inventions listed above
      do not relate to a single general inventive concept under PCT Rule 13.1 because,
      under PCT Rule 13.2, they lack the same or corresponding special technical features
      for the following reasons:\\nGroups I, II, and III lack unity of invention because
      even though the inventions of these groups require the technical feature of
      a method of purifying peptides and/or polypeptides bound to a mixed phase SPE
      material comprising washing with an acidic or neutral composition comprising
      at least 50% (v/v) organic solvent; and/or an acidic or neutral aqueous solution;
      and , this technical feature is not a special technical feature as it does not
      make a contribution over the prior art in view of WO2014/200346 by Van Noort.
      \ \\nGroups I, II, III, and IV lack unity of invention because even though the
      inventions of these groups require the technical feature of a mixed SPE material
      and a alcohol, acetonitrile, and/or an acidic or neutral aqueous solution, this
      technical feature is not a special technical feature as it does not make a contribution
      over the prior art in view of WO2014/200346 by Van Noort.  \\nThis application
      contains claims directed to more than one species of the generic invention.
      These species are deemed to lack unity of invention because they are not so
      linked as to form a single general inventive concept under PCT Rule 13.1. \\nThe
      species are as follows: \\nSpecies A: Composition of mixed phase SPE material\\nA1:
      DVB\\nA2: SDB\\nSpecies B: Organic solvent for washing\\nB1: alcohols\\nB2:
      alkanes\\nB3: halogenated hydrocarbons\\nB4: ethers\\nB5: ketones\\nB6: nitriles\\nB7:
      sulfoxides\\n B8: esters\\nSpecies C: Organic solvent for eluting\\nC1: alcohols\\nC2:
      alkanes\\nC3: halogenated hydrocarbons\\nC4: ethers\\nC5: ketones\\nC6: nitriles\\nC7:
      sulfoxides\\nC8: esters\\n\\nApplicant is required, in reply to this action,
      to elect a single species to which the claims shall be restricted if no generic
      claim is finally held to be allowable. The reply must also identify the claims
      readable on the elected species, including any claims subsequently added. An
      argument that a claim is allowable or that all claims are generic is considered
      non-responsive unless accompanied by an election.  The applicant is required
      to elect one species from each group of species. \\nUpon the allowance of a
      generic claim, applicant will be entitled to consideration of claims to additional
      species which are written in dependent form or otherwise require all the limitations
      of an allowed generic claim. Currently, the following claim(s) are generic:
      none. \\nApplicant is reminded that upon the cancellation of claims to a non-elected
      invention, the inventorship must be corrected in compliance with  37 CFR 1.48(a)
      if one or more of the  currently named inventors is no longer an inventor of
      at least one claim remaining in the application. A request to correct inventorship
      under 37 CFR 1.48(a) must be accompanied by an application data sheet in accordance
      with 37 CFR 1.76 that identifies each inventor by his or her legal name and
      by the processing fee required under 37 CFR 1.17(i).\\nThe examiner has required
      restriction between product or apparatus claims and process claims. Where applicant
      elects claims directed to the product/apparatus, and all product/apparatus claims
      are subsequently found allowable, withdrawn process claims that include all
      the limitations of the allowable product/apparatus claims should be considered
      for rejoinder. All claims directed to a nonelected process invention must include
      all the limitations of an allowable product/apparatus claim for that process
      invention to be rejoined. \\nIn the event of rejoinder, the requirement for
      restriction between the product/apparatus claims and the rejoined process claims
      will be withdrawn, and the rejoined process claims will be fully examined for
      patentability in accordance with 37 CFR 1.104. Thus, to be allowable, the rejoined
      claims must meet all criteria for patentability including the requirements of
      35 U.S.C. 101, 102, 103 and 112. Until all claims to the elected product/apparatus
      are found allowable, an otherwise proper restriction requirement between product/apparatus
      claims and process claims may be maintained. Withdrawn process claims that are
      not commensurate in scope with an allowable product/apparatus claim will not
      be rejoined. See MPEP \xA7 821.04. Additionally, in order for rejoinder to occur,
      applicant is advised that the process claims should be amended during prosecution
      to require the limitations of the product/apparatus claims. Failure to do so
      may result in no rejoinder. Further, note that the prohibition against double
      patenting rejections of 35 U.S.C. 121 does not apply where the  restriction
      requirement is withdrawn by the examiner before the patent issues. See MPEP
      \xA7 804.01.\\nAny inquiry concerning this communication or earlier communications

      2013, is being examined under the first inventor to file provisions of the AIA
      .\\nDETAILED ACTION\\nEntry Amendment\\n1.\\tThe amendment filed December 27,
      2016 has been entered. Claims 1 and 15-16 have been amended. Claims 3-5, 7-8
      and 10 are cancelled. Therefore, claims 1-2, 6, 9 and 11-18 are under consideration
      in this office action.\\n\\n\\nMaintained Grounds of Rejection\\nClaim Rejections
      - 35 USC \xA7 101\\n35 U.S.C. 101 reads as follows:\\nWhoever invents or discovers
      any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter,
      or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject
      to the conditions and requirements of this title.\\n\\n2. \\t Claims 1-2, 6,
      9, and 11-18 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 101 because the claimed invention
      is not directed to patent eligible subject matter. Based upon an analysis with
      respect to the claim as a whole, claims 1-2 are determined to be directed to
      natural products. The rationale for this determination is explained below.\\nThe
      claims are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 101 because the claimed invention is not
      directed to patent eligible subject matter. Based upon an analysis with respect
      to the claims as a whole, the claims are determined to be directed to a natural
      product and do not recite something \u201Csignificantly different\u201D than
      the natural product. Natural products  are \u201Cjudicial exemptions\u201D.
      The claims now recite \u201Cseparate\u201D however an isolated separate polypeptide
      is not significantly different from the naturally occurring polypeptide.  Furthermore
      SEQ ID NO: 6 and 10 are naturally occurring peptides. \\nThe claims also now
      recite the composition comprises a nucleic acid sequences expressed by a suitable
      expression system wherein said expression system is a DNA plasmid or replicating
      or non-replicating viral vector.  However the expression system is not a part
      of the composition. Instead the claim merely recite that the naturally occurring
      sequence was expressed by an expression system. The means of expressing a naturally
      occurring product do not recite something \u201Csignificantly different\u201D
      than the naturally occurring product. \\nThe claims are drawn to compositions
      comprising isolated Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite and liver stage antigens
      as recited by amino acid sequences SEQ ID NO:, 6 and 10 and further comprising
      SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 8, 12 and 14. These antigen sequences are not \u201Cmarkedly
      different\u201D in structure than naturally occurring Plasmodium falciparum
      sporozoite and liver stage antigens. See Felgner et al., (US Patent Publication
      \ 2008/0260763). Thus, the instantly claimed polypeptides appear to simply be
      separate proteins isolated from Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite and liver stage
      antigens are therefore not markedly different from the Plasmodium falciparum
      sporozoite and liver stage antigens polypeptides found in nature. These claims
      fail to satisfy the non-naturally occurring requirement. Furthermore, there
      is no structural difference because of the mere aggregation of natural occurring
      proteins together as a composition; the composition does not change the structure
      of the polypeptides. \\n The broadest reasonable interpretation (BRI) of the
      claim is a sufficient amount of the Peptide to produce an immunogenic response
      in a typical patient, which is mixed with a pharmaceutically sufficient amount
      of a carrier such as water. Thus, one embodiment within the BRI is a mixture
      of the Peptides and water. Because the peptide and carrier are composed of matter,
      the claim is directed to a statutory category, e.g., a composition of matter.
      \\nThe claim is then analyzed to determine whether it is directed to any judicial
      exception. The recited mixture of Peptides and water is a nature-based product
      that must be compared to its closest naturally occurring counterpart to determine
      if it has markedly different characteristics than the counterpart. Because the
      Peptides and water do not occur together in nature, there is no naturally occurring
      counterpart mixture for comparison, and so the claimed mixture is compared to
      its naturally occurring components, i.e., Peptides, and water. The peptides
      are naturally occurring, along with water, so neither would be eligible as claimed
      on their own.\\nWith regard to regard, to Chilton et al., (Infect. Immunol.
      2013. Vol. 81(9): 3317-25) teach that two naturally produced forms of monophosphorylated
      LPS, from the mucosa-associated bacteria Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Prevotella
      intermedia, function as immunological adjuvants for antigen-specific immune
      responses. Therefore, the peptides, adjuvant and pharmaceutically acceptable
      carrier are all naturally occurring, so none would be eligible as claimed on
      their own. Thus, the claims as a whole does not amount to significantly more
      than each \u201Cproduct of nature\u201D by itself. The claims do not qualify
      as eligible subject matter.\\n If the applicant chooses to amend the instant
      claims, the examiner recommends that applicant consider the U.S. Supreme Court
      ruling that the additional steps should consist of more than well-understood,
      routine, conventional activity already engaged in by the scientific community.
      Such putative additional steps, when viewed as a whole, might add nothing significant
      beyond the sum of their parts taken separately. The Court has made clear that
      to transform an unpatentable law of nature into a patent-eligible application
      of such a law, one must do more than simply state the law of nature while adding
      the words \u201Capply it.\u201D Essentially, appending conventional steps, specified
      at a high level of generality, to laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract
      ideas cannot make those laws, phenomena, and ideas patent-eligible.\\nThe patentability
      of laws of nature was confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in Mayo Collaborative
      Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., No. 10-1150 (March 20, 2012). The
      unpatentability of natural products was confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court
      in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., 569 U. S. (June
      13, 2013).  Also see the December, 2014 Guidance for Determining Subject Matter
      Eligibility of Claims Reciting or Involving Laws of Nature, Natural Phenomena,
      & Natural Products (the Guidance). \\nBased upon consideration of all of the
      relevant factors with respect to the claim as a whole, the claims are held to
      claim a law of nature and natural products, and are therefore rejected as ineligible
      subject matter under 35 U.S.C. 101.  \\n\\n\\n Response to Arguments\\n3.\\tApplicant's
      arguments filed December 27, 2016 have been fully considered but they are not
      persuasive. Applicants argue that the amended claims include an expression system
      which meets the definition of an exception.  However, the claim is drawn to
      a composition comprising nucleic acid sequences. The composition does not include
      the expression system. The claim only includes the isolated polypeptides and
      adjuvant, all of which are naturally occurring products. \\nWhile the mixture
      of these three naturally occurring components is novel and does not occur in
      nature, there is no indication that expressing the nucleic acids  changes the
      structure, function, or other properties of the polypeptides. For example, the
      claim encompasses a mixture where the polypeptides are heterogeneously dispersed
      in the carrier and adjuvant, but such heterogeneous mixing does not change the
      structure, function, or other properties of the peptides, carrier or adjuvant
      in any marked way. Similarly, expression does not change the polypeptide. Instead,
      the polypeptides, carrier and adjuvant retain their naturally occurring structures
      and functions, and is merely dispersed in the carrier and adjuvant, which also
      retain their naturally occurring structure and function. Thus, for at least
      one embodiment within the broadest reasonable interpretation, the claimed mixture
      as a whole does not display markedly different characteristics compared to the
      naturally occurring counterparts. Accordingly, each component is a \u201Cproduct
      of nature\u201D exception, and the claim is directed to at least one exception.
      \\n Next, the claim as a whole is analyzed to determine whether any additional
      element, or combination of elements, is sufficient to ensure that the claim
      amounts to significantly more than the exceptions. Because the component elements
      (the \u201Cproduct of nature\u201D exceptions) do not occur together in nature
      and are not markedly changed by their combination into a mixture, each is considered
      as an additional element to the other. This consideration provides an opportunity
      to explore whether this combination of \u201Cproducts of nature\u201D amounts
      to significantly more than the products themselves. As discussed above, mixing
      the peptides with a carrier and adjuvant does not markedly change the characteristics
      of any component, because each component continues to have the same properties
      in the mixture as it had alone. Furthermore, mere expression of the polypeptides
      does not markedly change the characteristics of any component, because each
      component continues to have the same properties. \\nIn addition, using an expression
      system was well-understood, routine & conventional prior to applicant\u2019s
      invention and at the time of filing the application, so expressing the polypeptides,
      , when recited at this high level of generality, does not meaningfully limit
      the claim. Thus, the claims as a whole does not amount to significantly more
      than each \u201Cproduct of nature\u201D and a product made using an expression
      system.  The claims do not qualify as eligible subject matter. \\n\\n\\nConclusion\\n4.\\tNo
      claims allowed.\\n 5.\\tTHIS ACTION IS MADE FINAL.  Applicant is reminded of
      the extension of time policy as set forth in 37 CFR 1.136(a).  \\nA shortened
      statutory period for reply to this final action is set to expire THREE MONTHS

      then the shortened statutory period will expire on the date the advisory action
      is mailed, and any extension fee pursuant to 37 CFR 1.136(a) will be calculated
      from the mailing date of the advisory action.  In no event, however, will the
      statutory period for reply expire later than SIX MONTHS from the mailing date
      of this final action. \\n\\n6.\\tAny inquiry concerning this communication or

      2-5 and 19 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)/(a)(2) as anticipated by or,
      in the alternative, under 35 U.S.C. 103 as obvious over U.S. 2018/0192702 LI,
      hereinafter LI.\\n\\tAs for claims 1-5 and 19, LI discloses an electronic cigarette
      [0003] with a battery [0003], a main control circuit (5) [0006] and an atomizer
      [0003].  The atomizer comprises a core and chamber [0003, Figure 1].  The Examiner
      interprets the chamber of the atomizer as the body of the atomizer.  The control
      circuit acquires operating information (sense unit) and compares it to a preset
      threshold [Figure 2].  If the preset threshold is exceeded the device it interrupts
      (204) the operation of the device [0018 and Figure 2].\\nLI discloses that the
      atomizer consists of an atomization chamber and a core [0003] the core of the
      atomizer can be replaced [0042] therefore the examiner interprets it as implicitly
      being detachably mounted sufficient for anticipation.\\n\\tIn the alternative
      it would be obvious to make the core detachable.  It is prima facie obvious
      to make two components separable [see e.g. MPEP 2144.04 (V)(C)].  The person
      of ordinary skill in the art would be motivated to do so such that the core
      could be replaced as needed without replacing the remaining chamber of the atomizer.\\n\\tThe
      atomizer comprises a recording chip that is connected thereto [0034].  The recording
      chip is connected via a third poll to the e-cigarette controller [0034] which
      is a first electrical interface.  The recording chip identifies the core [0017]
      it is therefore an ID chip.  The recording chip also comprises a life remaining
      element [0016].  The recording chip stores information therefore it is a memory.
      \ The memory of the chip is readable by the control chip [Figure 1 and 2].  The
      memory is writable because information can be \u201Crecorded\u201D on the chip
      [0014].\\nThe recording chip is connected to the atomizer core [0034] which
      the examiner interprets as being mounted to the core.  The applicant never defines
      what is required to be considered mounted.  An electrical connection could be
      considered mounting.\\n In the alternative, the recording chip is part of the
      atomizer which has the core and the chamber (body).  There are only two places
      from which the recording chip can be mounted the core or the chamber (body).
      \  Therefore the limitation is anticipated based on there only being two species
      for where the recording chip can be mounted that are at once envisaged by the
      disclosure [see e.g. MPEP 2132.02 (III)].\\nIn the further alternative there
      are a small number of places that the recording chip can be mounted within the
      atomizer.  It can be mounted to the chamber or the core.  As there are a small
      number of choices it would be obvious to try both location to the person of
      ordinary skill in the art.  The person of ordinary skill in the art would further
      look to mount the chip with the core as it is the core being identified and
      being replaced.  If the chip was mounted on the chamber it would no longer have
      identification information on the new core.\\n\\tThe atomizer core is also connected
      to a second electrical interface to provide energy to the heater [0003 \u201CThe
      heating wires may be equipped with positive and negative poles respectively
      connected to the positive and negative poles of the electric power supply via
      conductive wires and conductive columns\u201D].\\nAs for claim 7, the main control
      unit can send out a reminder that the core needs to be replaced soon [0042].\\n
      Claim 8 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as obvious over U.S. 2018/0192702 LI,
      hereinafter LI., in view of U.S. 2017/0000192 LI, hereinafter LI II.\\n*nota
      bene: although the inventors of both publications have they are different people
      based upon their first name.\\n\\tLI discloses an atomizer, a battery, and a
      controller.  LI does not disclose that the controller is located with the battery
      assembly.  LI II in the same art of electronic cigarettes disclose an electronic
      cigarette with a battery, controller, atomizer, and identification chip.  LI
      II discloses that the battery and controller chip can be part of the reusable
      cigarette rod (10) while the atomizer and chip is part of a cartridge (20) [Figure
      1].  At the time of the invention it would be obvious to arrange the atomizer,
      battery and controller of LI like the e-cigarette of LI II.  It is prima facie
      obvious to apply one known technique of arranging an e-cigarette parts to another
      e-cigarette with the same parts.  The person of ordinary skill in the art would
      be motivated to use this arrangement as it prevents a mismatch of the cigarette
      rod/battery with the atomizer [0027]. The person of ordinary skill in the art
      would expect success as this part arrangement is shown to work in e-cigarettes
      and in e-cigarettes with identification chips which both LI and LI II have.
      \   Furthermore, rearrangement of parts is typically prima facie obvious [see
      e.g. MPEP 2144.04 (VI)(C)].\\n\"],\n        \"sections.submissionDate\":\"2022-07-06T04:00:00Z\",\n

      argues that the rejection towards LI should be withdrawn because of the claimed

      that is electrically connected to the atomizing core, the second electrical
      interface is electrically connected to the main control circuit\u201D.    The

      is different from the feature \u201Cthe atomizer is provided with a second electrical
      interface\u201D.\\n\\tIn response the core is part of the atomizing body and
      therefore the heating wires of the core is part of the atomizing body.  Consequently,
      the atomizer body is provided with a second electrical interface.\\nApplicant
      argues against the mounting of the recording chip.  The applicant argues that
      barcode may be read.  As such the location of the recording chip could be on
      the aromatic liquid cartridge.\\n\\tIn response, the barcode limitations are
      only a single embodiment.  The barcode embodiment does not relieve the fact
      that the recording chip must be with the actual atomizer that is removable (if
      it wasn\u2019t an the atomizing core was moved to another vaporizer then it
      would not have a record of how many uses).  The LI publication explicitly states
      that the recording chip is connected which the Examiner interpreted as \u201Cmounted\u201D
      or obvious.  Finally, a change of location of a component is prima facie obvious
      absence of unexpected results.\\n\\nClaim Rejections - 35 USC \xA7 102\\nThe
      following is a quotation of the appropriate paragraphs of 35 U.S.C. 102 that
      form the basis for the rejections under this section made in this Office action:\\nA
      person shall be entitled to a patent unless \u2013\\n\\n(a)(1) the claimed invention
      was patented, described in a printed publication, or in public use, on sale,
      or otherwise available to the public before the effective filing date of the
      claimed invention.\\n\\n\\n(a)(2) the claimed invention was described in a patent
      issued under section 151, or in an application for patent published or deemed
      published under section 122(b), in which the patent or application, as the case
      may be, names another inventor and was effectively filed before the effective
      filing date of the claimed invention.\\n\\n\\nClaim Rejections - 35 USC \xA7
      103\\nThe following is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 103 which forms the basis for
      all obviousness rejections set forth in this Office action:\\nA patent for a
      claimed invention may not be obtained, notwithstanding that the claimed invention
      is not identically disclosed as set forth in section 102, if the differences
      between the claimed invention and the prior art are such that the claimed invention
      as a whole would have been obvious before the effective filing date of the claimed
      invention to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which the claimed
      invention pertains. Patentability shall not be negated by the manner in which
      the invention was made.\\n\\nThe factual inquiries for establishing a background
      for determining obviousness under 35 U.S.C. 103 are summarized as follows:\\n1.
      Determining the scope and contents of the prior art.\\n2. Ascertaining the differences
      between the prior art and the claims at issue.\\n3. Resolving the level of ordinary
      skill in the pertinent art.\\n4. Considering objective evidence present in the
      application indicating obviousness or nonobviousness.\\nClaims 2-5 and 19 are
      rejected under 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)/(a)(2) as anticipated by or, in the alternative,
      under 35 U.S.C. 103 as obvious over U.S. 2018/0192702 LI, hereinafter LI.\\n\\tAs
      for claims 1-5 and 19, LI discloses an electronic cigarette [0003] with a battery
      [0003], a main control circuit (5) [0006] and an atomizer [0003].  The atomizer
      comprises a core and chamber [0003, Figure 1].  The Examiner interprets the
      chamber of the atomizer as the body of the atomizer.  The control circuit acquires
      operating information (sense unit) and compares it to a preset threshold [Figure
      2].  If the preset threshold is exceeded the device it interrupts (204) the
      operation of the device [0018 and Figure 2].\\nLI discloses that the atomizer
      consists of an atomization chamber and a core [0003] the core of the atomizer
      can be replaced [0042] therefore the examiner interprets it as implicitly being
      detachably mounted sufficient for anticipation.\\n\\tIn the alternative it would
      be obvious to make the core detachable.  It is prima facie obvious to make two
      components separable [see e.g. MPEP 2144.04 (V)(C)].  The person of ordinary
      skill in the art would be motivated to do so such that the core could be replaced
      as needed without replacing the remaining chamber of the atomizer.\\n\\tThe
      atomizer comprises a recording chip that is connected thereto [0034].  The recording
      chip is connected via a third poll to the e-cigarette controller [0034] which
      is a first electrical interface.  The recording chip identifies the core [0017]
      it is therefore an ID chip.  The recording chip also comprises a life remaining
      element [0016].  The recording chip stores information therefore it is a memory.
      \ The memory of the chip is readable by the control chip [Figure 1 and 2].  The
      memory is writable because information can be \u201Crecorded\u201D on the chip
      [0014].\\nThe recording chip is connected to the atomizer core [0034] which
      the examiner interprets as being mounted to the core.  The applicant never defines
      what is required to be considered mounted.  An electrical connection could be
      considered mounting.\\n In the alternative, the recording chip is part of the
      atomizer which has the core and the chamber (body).  There are only two places
      from which the recording chip can be mounted the core or the chamber (body).
      \  Therefore the limitation is anticipated based on there only being two species
      for where the recording chip can be mounted that are at once envisaged by the
      disclosure [see e.g. MPEP 2132.02 (III)].\\nIn the further alternative there
      are a small number of places that the recording chip can be mounted within the
      atomizer.  It can be mounted to the chamber or the core.  As there are a small
      number of choices it would be obvious to try both location to the person of
      ordinary skill in the art.  The person of ordinary skill in the art would further
      look to mount the chip with the core as it is the core being identified and
      being replaced.  If the chip was mounted on the chamber it would no longer have
      identification information on the new core.\\n\\tThe atomizer core is also connected
      to a second electrical interface to provide energy to the heater [0003 \u201CThe
      heating wires may be equipped with positive and negative poles respectively
      connected to the positive and negative poles of the electric power supply via
      conductive wires and conductive columns\u201D].\\nAs for claim 7, the main control
      unit can send out a reminder that the core needs to be replaced soon [0042].\\nClaim
      8 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as obvious over U.S. 2018/0192702 LI, hereinafter
      LI., in view of U.S. 2017/0000192 LI, hereinafter LI II.\\n*nota bene: although
      the inventors of both publications have they are different people based upon
      their first name.\\n\\tLI discloses an atomizer, a battery, and a controller.
      \ LI does not disclose that the controller is located with the battery assembly.
      \ LI II in the same art of electronic cigarettes disclose an electronic cigarette
      with a battery, controller, atomizer, and identification chip.  LI II discloses
      that the battery and controller chip can be part of the reusable cigarette rod
      (10) while the atomizer and chip is part of a cartridge (20) [Figure 1].  At
      the time of the invention it would be obvious to arrange the atomizer, battery
      and controller of LI like the e-cigarette of LI II.  It is prima facie obvious
      to apply one known technique of arranging an e-cigarette parts to another e-cigarette
      with the same parts.  The person of ordinary skill in the art would be motivated
      to use this arrangement as it prevents a mismatch of the cigarette rod/battery
      with the atomizer [0027]. The person of ordinary skill in the art would expect
      success as this part arrangement is shown to work in e-cigarettes and in e-cigarettes
      with identification chips which both LI and LI II have.    Furthermore, rearrangement
      of parts is typically prima facie obvious [see e.g. MPEP 2144.04 (VI)(C)].\\nConclusion\\nApplicant's
      amendment necessitated the new ground(s) of rejection presented in this Office
      action.  Accordingly, THIS ACTION IS MADE FINAL.  See MPEP \xA7 706.07(a).  Applicant

      unpatentable over one embodiment of Hotelling et al. (US 20080062148) in view
      of another embodiment of Hotelling et al. (US 20080062148).\\nAs to claim 1,
      Hotelling discloses a touch display panel, comprising: \\na display module (Fig.
      34: includes CF, LC, TFT, Bottom glass) comprising a color filter substrate
      (Fig. 34: CF), a TFT substrate (Fig. 34: TFT), and a liquid crystal layer (Fig.
      34: LC), \\nwherein the liquid crystal layer (Fig. 34: LC) is disposed between
      the color filter substrate (Fig. 34: CF) and the TFT substrate (Fig. 34: TFT);\\n
      a polarizer (Fig. 34: Polarizer) disposed opposite to the display module (Fig.
      34: CF, LC, TFT, Bottom glass); \\na first touch electrode structure (Fig. 34:
      ITO1); and \\na second touch electrode structure (Fig. 34: ITO2), wherein the
      first touch electrode structure and the second touch electrode structure are
      electrically insulated from each other (Fig. 34: top glass (Note: glass is well-known
      as insulator)) and are disposed between the polarizer (Fig. 34: Polarizer) and
      the color filter substrate (Fig. 34: CF) of the display module (Fig. 34: includes
      CF, LC, TFT, Bottom glass). \\nIn this embodiment, Hotelling does not teach
      the liquid crystal layer is in direct contact with the color filter substrate.
      \\nIn another embodiment, Hotelling teaches the liquid crystal layer (Fig. 88:
      liquid crystal) is in direct contact with the color filter substrate (Fig. 88:
      CF including CF plate, [0014]). \\nTherefore, it would have been obvious to
      one of ordinary skill in the art before the effective filing date of the claimed
      invention to modify Hotelling\u2019s one embodiment (Fig. 13) by adapting Hotelling\u2019s
      idea of having liquid crystal layer in direct contact with the color filter
      substrate of another embodiment (Fig. 88) in order to improve visual effect.
      \\nAs to claim 2, Hotelling\u2019s one embodiment (as modified by Hotelling\u2019s
      another embodiment) teach the touch display panel of claim 1, wherein the first
      touch electrode structure (Fig. 34(3401): ITO1) is in direct contact with a
      bottom surface of the polarizer (Fig. 34(3404): Polarizer), and \\n the second

      (as modified by Hotelling\u2019s another embodiment) teach the touch display
      panel of claim 1, further comprising a transparent substrate (Fig. 34: Top glass)
      disposed between the display module (Fig. 34: includes CF, LC, TFT, Bottom glass)
      and the polarizer (Fig. 34: Polarizer). \\nAs to claim 5, Hotelling\u2019s one
      embodiment (as modified by Hotelling\u2019s another embodiment) teach the touch
      display panel of claim 3, wherein the first touch electrode structure (Fig.

      (Fig. 34: Top glass) is located between the first touch electrode structure
      (Fig. 34: ITO1) and the second touch electrode structure (Fig. 34: ITO2). \\nAs
      to claim 6, Hotelling\u2019s one embodiment (as modified by Hotelling\u2019s
      another embodiment) teach the touch display panel of claim 3, wherein the first
      touch electrode structure (Fig. 34: ITO1) is disposed below the polarizer (Fig.
      34: Polarizer) and is located between the polarizer (Fig. 34: Polarizer) and
      the transparent substrate (Fig. 34: Top glass). \\n As to claim 7, Hotelling\u2019s
      one embodiment (as modified by Hotelling\u2019s another embodiment) teach the
      touch display panel of claim 6, wherein the second touch electrode structure
      (Fig. 34: ITO2) is disposed below the transparent substrate (Fig. 34: Top glass)
      and is located between the transparent substrate (Fig. 34: Top glass) and the
      color filter substrate (Fig. 34: CF, Fig. 88: CF including CF plate). \\nAs
      to claim 8, Hotelling\u2019s one embodiment (as modified by Hotelling\u2019s
      another embodiment) teach the touch display panel of claim 6, wherein the second
      touch electrode structure (Fig. 13: ITO2) is in direct contact with the top

      glass) (as best understood). \\nAs to claim 12, Hotelling\u2019s one embodiment
      (as modified by Hotelling\u2019s another embodiment) teach the touch display
      panel of claim 2, wherein an adhesive layer ([0351]: electrodes or sense lines
      can be adhered together) is disposed between the first touch electrode structure
      (Fig. 34: ITO1) and the second touch electrode structure (Fig. 34: ITO2) (as
      best understood). \\nAs to claim 13, Hotelling\u2019s one embodiment (as modified
      by Hotelling\u2019s another embodiment) teach the touch display panel of claim
      7, wherein an adhesive layer ([0351]: electrodes or sense lines can be adhered
      together) is disposed between the transparent substrate (Fig. 34: Top glass)
      and the color filter substrate (Fig. 34: CF, Fig. 88: CF including CF plate,
      Note: ITO2 is between Top glass and CF, therefore, it is obvious to adhesive
      layer between Top glass and CF). \\nAs to claim 14, Hotelling\u2019s one embodiment
      (as modified by Hotelling\u2019s another embodiment) teach the touch display
      panel of claim 8, wherein an adhesive layer ([0351]: electrodes or sense lines

      13: Top glass) and the color filter substrate (Fig. 13: CF, Fig. 88: CF including
      CF plate, Note: ITO2 is between Top glass and CF, therefore, it is obvious to
      adhesive layer between Top glass and CF) (as best understood).\\nAs to claim
      15, it is different than the apparatus of claim 1 such that Hotelling\u2019s
      one embodiment (as modified by Hotelling\u2019s another embodiment) teach a
      display module (Fig. 34: includes CF, LC, TFT, Bottom glass) comprising a substrate

      ([0351]: electrodes or sense lines can be adhered together) is disposed between
      the first touch electrode structure (Fig. 34: ITO1) and the second touch electrode
      structure (Fig. 34: ITO2). Please see claim 1 for detail analysis. \\nAs to

      layer may be formed such that up to about 10% of the touch sensing area is covered
      by an electrode material. Widths and spacings to provide coverage in the exemplary
      range allow for good transparency of the sensing panel. Configuring the line
      pattern to reduce the coverage  percentage toward the lower end of the range,

      to Arguments\\n14.\\tApplicant's arguments filed April 3, 2017 have been fully
      considered but they are not persuasive. \\n\\n\\tOn the 2nd page of Remarks,
      Applicant asserts that Hotelling does not teach \u201Cthe color filter substrate\u201D
      (claim 1). The Examiner respectfully disagrees to this assertion. \\n\\tHotelling
      clearly teaches the color filter substrate (Fig. 34: CF, Fig. 88: CF including
      CF plate, [0014]).\\n\\nOn the 3rd page of Remarks, Applicant states that Hotelling
      does not teach \u201Cthe liquid crystal layer is in direct contact with the
      color filter substrate\u201D (claim 1). The Examiner respectfully disagrees
      to this statement. \\n\\tHotelling teaches the liquid crystal layer (Fig. 88:
      liquid crystal) is in direct contact with the color filter substrate (Fig. 88:
      CF including CF plate).\\n\\nOn the 4th page of Remarks, Applicant recites that
      Hotelling does not teach \u201Can adhesive layer is disposed between the first
      touch electrode structure and the second touch electrode structure\u201D (claim
      15). The Examiner respectfully disagrees to this argument. \\n\\tHotelling teaches
      an adhesive layer ([0351]: electrodes or sense lines can be adhered together)
      is disposed between the first touch electrode structure (Fig. 34: ITO1) and
      the second touch electrode structure (Fig. 34: ITO2).\\n\\t\\nAs per Applicant's
      argument (3rd - 5th pages of Remarks) about \\\"an adhesive layer is disposed
      between the transparent substrate and the color filter substrate\\\" (claims
      13, 14, and 27), Hotelling teaches an adhesive layer ([0351]: electrodes or
      sense lines can be adhered together) is disposed between the transparent substrate
      (Fig. 34: Top glass) and the color filter substrate (Fig. 34: CF, Fig. 88: CF
      including CF plate, Note: ITO2 is between Top glass and CF, therefore, it is
      obvious to adhesive layer between Top glass and CF).\\n\\nOn the 5th page of
      Remarks, Applicant argues that the cited references do not teach \u201Cthe first
      touch electrode structure is in direct contact with a bottom surface of the
      transparent substrate, and the first touch electrode structure is located between
      the transparent substrate and the display module\u201D (claims 4 and 18). The
      Examiner again respectfully disagrees to this argument. \\nKim teaches the first
      touch electrode structure (Fig. 3(322), [0043]: \u201Cthe first and second conductive
      polymer layers 320 and 330 may include respective first regions 322 and 332
      used as sensing electrodes\u201D) in direct contact with a bottom surface of
      the transparent substrate (Fig. 3(340): cover glass), and the first touch electrode

      plant part includes seed, therefore a maize seed/plant produced by crossing

      issued under section 151, or in an application for patent published or deemed
      published under section 122(b), in which the patent or application, as the case
      may be, names another inventor and was effectively filed before the effective
      filing date of the claimed invention.\\nClaims 3-8 are rejected under 35 U.S.C.
      102(a)(1)/(a)(2) as being anticipated by Johnson et al. (US Patent Number 8,466,355).\\nInstant
      claims 3-5 are drawn to An F1 hybrid maize seed/plant produced by crossing the
      plant part of claim1. Instant claims 6-8 are drawn to a method to producing
      a second maize plant by applying breeding technique to the plant part of claims
      5 or a method for producing commodity product using the plant part of claims
      5.\\nAs shown in definition on page 25, plant part includes seed, therefore
      a maize seed/plant produced by crossing the plant part of claim1 with a different
      maize plant reads on F2 seed/plant. Without knowing the other parent for the
      crossing, the F2 seed/plant of claims 3-5 reads on any maize seed/plant, which
      was taught by Johnson et al. (claims 1-39).   Although claim 3 has a limitation
      of \u201CF1 hybrid maize seed\u201D, as discussed above in the rejection under
      35 U.S.C. 112(b), it is unclear if it refers F1 hybrid maize seed of AN1082.
      As a result, an F1 hybrid maize seed of a F1 seed of AN1082 could still reads
      on F2 seeds of AN1082.  Therefore claims 6-8 read on a method of producing any
      maize plant by apply any breeding technique to any maize plant or a method for
      producing commodity product using any maize plant, which was taught by Johnson
      et al. in claims 6, 16-17.\\n To overcome the rejection, it is suggested to
      clearly refer \u201CF1 hybrid maize seed\u201D in claim 3 as -- F1 hybrid maize
      seed of AN1082--, and to specify in claim 5 that the plant part comprises a
      somatic cell of the F1 hybrid maize plant of AN1082.\\nRequest for Information

      et al. (US 2009/0140053, hereinafter Yamazaki (\u2018053)), and Lin (US Patent
      No. 6,177,336). \\nWith respect to Claims 2 and 3, Yamazaki discloses a method
      for manufacturing a semiconductor device (Yamazaki, Figs. 41A, 41B, 11A-11C,
      \xB60309, \xB60173-\xB60179, \xB60064-\xB60072, \xB60103-\xB60107) comprising

      are added to the semiconductor layer using the gate electrode as a mask (Yamazaki,
      Figs. 4C, 11C, \xB60109, \xB60177). Further, Iwasaki discloses a field effect
      transistor having oxide semiconductor (amorphous oxide including In, Ga, Zn,
      and O) as a channel layer (11) (Iwasaki, Figs. 2, 7A-7C, \xB60091-\xB60093);
      and adding dopant (Iwasaki, Figs. 2, \xB60093) to the oxide semiconductor layer
      using the gate electrode (15) as a mask.\\nIt would have been obvious to a person
      of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to modify the
      method of Yamazaki by forming source and drain regions using teachings of Yamazaki
      and Iwasaki and forming an oxide semiconductor as a channel layer as taught

      as a mask in order to provide stable electric connection  of channel region
      by forming source/drain regions with higher electric conductivity and from an
      oxide number='11'semiconductor material of the channel region, and thus to improve
      the uniformity and reliability of the elements (Iwasaki, \xB60025, \xB60095).\\nRegarding

      (silicon nitride oxide) (Yamazaki (\u2018053), Fig. 9B, \xB60042, \xB60045,
      \xB60106) having a projection portion over a substrate (101) (Yamazaki (\u2018053),
      Fig. 9B, \xB60058, \xB60106); a semiconductor film (106) (Yamazaki (\u2018053),
      Fig. 9B, \xB60039, \xB60064, \xB60106) over a top surface of the projection
      portion.\\nIt would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art
      at the time the invention was made to modify the method of Yamazaki by forming
      an insulating film having a projection portion as taught by Yamazaki (\u2018053)
      to have a second insulating film with a projection portion from the first insulating
      film; and an oxide semiconductor layer on the projection portion in order to
      provide a reinforcement film arranged to reinforce the semiconductor film (Yamazaki
      (\u2018053), \xB60039).\\nRegarding (3)-(5), Lin teaches a planarization process
      performed to planarize the insulating layer (224) (Lin, Figs. 2C, 2D, Col. 4,
      lines 17-26) so that the cap layer (20) is exposed and the insulating layer
      (224, silicon oxide) becomes an insulating layer (224a); and then removing the
      cap layer by etching so that a top surface of the semiconductor layer (208)
      is exposed; the planarization includes chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process
      (Lin, Figs. 2D, Col. 4, lines 24-26); adding dopant to the semiconductor layer
      using the gate electrode as a mask (forming a lightly doped region 218) (Lin,
      Figs. 2A, Col. 3, lines 47-56); and forming a sidewall insulating layer (212)
      (Lin, Figs. 2A, Col. 3, lines 57-60) in contact with the gate electrode after
      adding the dopant to the oxide semiconductor layer.\\nIt would have been obvious
      to a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made
      to modify the method of Yamazaki by forming source and drain regions using teachings
      of Yamazaki and Lin and performing a planarization treatment on silicon oxide
      insulating layer as taught by Lin to have planarization treatment on the fourth
      insulating film until part of the third insulating film overlapping with the
      oxide semiconductor layer is exposed; wherein the planarization treatment is
      performed by chemical mechanical polish treatment (as claimed in Claim 3); and
      adding dopant to the semiconductor layer using the gate electrode as a mask;
      and forming a sidewall insulating layer in contact number='12'with the gate
      electrode after adding the dopant to the oxide semiconductor layer in order
      to provide an improved method for fabricating MOS transistor to avoid an extra
      mask for performing a selective local implantation and using a conventional
      planarization process (Lin, Col. 2, lines 37-41; lines 48-63).\\nRegarding Claim
      6, Yamazaki in view of Iwasaki, Yamazaki (\u2018053)), and Lin discloses the
      method for manufacturing a semiconductor device according to claim 2. Further,
      Yamazaki does not specifically disclose in embodiment of Figs. 41A-41B adding
      dopant to the oxide semiconductor layer using the sidewall insulating layer
      and the gate electrode as a mask. However, Yamazaki teaches an embodiment of
      Fig. 14A, wherein dopant is to be added to the semiconductor layer using the
      sidewall insulating layer (35) (Yamazaki, Figs. 14A, \xB60196) and the gate
      electrode (34) as a mask.\\nIt would have been obvious to a person of ordinary
      skill in the art at the time the invention was made to further modify the method
      of Yamazaki by forming high concentration impurity regions and low concentration
      impurity regions as taught by Yamazaki to have adding dopant to the oxide semiconductor
      layer using the sidewall insulating layer and the gate electrode as a mask in
      order to provide low concentration regions to lower electric field in the drain
      (Yamazaki, \xB60196).\\nRegarding Claim 7, Yamazaki in view of Iwasaki, Yamazaki
      (\u2018053)), and Lin discloses the method for manufacturing a semiconductor
      device according to claim 2. Further, Yamazaki does not specifically disclose
      that the oxide semiconductor layer contains indium, gallium and zinc. However,
      Iwasaki discloses a field effect transistor having oxide semiconductor, specifically,
      amorphous oxide including In, Ga, Zn, and O) as a channel layer (11) (Iwasaki,
      Figs. 2, 7A-7C, \xB60091-\xB60093).\\nIt would have been obvious to a person
      of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to modify the
      method of Yamazaki by forming an oxide semiconductor as a channel layer as taught
      by Iwasaki so that the oxide semiconductor layer contains indium, gallium and
      zinc in order to provide stable electric connection  of channel region by forming
      source/drain regions with higher electric conductivity and from an oxide semiconductor
      material of the channel region, and thus to improve the uniformity and reliability
      of the elements (Iwasaki, \xB60025, \xB60095).number='13'\\nWith respect to
      Claims 14 and 16, Yamazaki discloses a method for manufacturing a semiconductor
      device (Yamazaki, Figs. 41A, 41B, 11A-11C, \xB60309, \xB60173-\xB60179, \xB60064-\xB60072,

      the semiconductor layer using the gate electrode as a mask (Yamazaki, Figs.

      Iwasaki and forming an oxide semiconductor as a channel layer as taught by Iwasaki
      to have a semiconductor device comprising an oxide semiconductor film; and adding

      discloses a semiconductor device (Yamazaki, Fig. 9B, \xB60007, \xB60010, \xB60106)
      comprising: a first insulating film (103) (silicon nitride oxide) (Yamazaki
      (\u2018053), Fig. 9B, \xB60042, \xB60045, \xB60106) having a projection portion

      projection portion as taught by Yamazaki (\u2018053) to have a second insulating
      film with a projection portion from the first insulating film; and an oxide
      semiconductor layer on the projection portion in order to provide a reinforcement
      film arranged to reinforce the semiconductor film (Yamazaki (\u2018053), \xB60039).\\nRegarding
      (3)-(5), Lin teaches planarization process performed to planarize the insulating
      layer (224) (Lin, Figs. 2C, 2D, Col. 4, lines 17-26) so that the cap layer (20)
      is exposed and the insulating layer (224, silicon oxide) becomes an insulating
      layer (224a); and then removing the cap layer by etching so that a top surface
      of the semiconductor layer (208) is exposed; the planarization includes chemical
      mechanical polishing (CMP) process (Lin, Figs. 2D, Col. 4, lines 24-26); adding
      dopant to the semiconductor layer using the gate electrode as a mask (forming
      a lightly doped region 218) (Lin, Figs. 2A, Col. 3, lines 47-56); and forming
      a sidewall insulating layer (212) (Lin, Figs. 2A, Col. 3, lines 57-60) in contact
      with the gate electrode after adding the dopant to the oxide semiconductor layer.\\nIt
      would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time
      the invention was made to modify the method of Yamazaki by forming source and
      drain regions using teachings of Yamazaki and Lin and performing a planarization
      treatment on silicon oxide insulating layer as taught by Lin to have planarization
      treatment on the fourth insulating film until part of the third insulating film

      an extra mask for performing a selective local implantation and using a conventional
      planarization process (Lin, Col. 2, lines 37-41; lines 48-63).\\nRegarding (6),
      Yamazaki teaches embodiments of Fig. 27C, wherein an electrode (164) comprising
      a first conductive layer in contact with the semiconductor layer (Yamazaki,
      Fig. 27C, \xB60259, \xB60263) is formed. Further, Ishikawa teaches forming a
      transistor having an electrode (source/drain electrodes 622/624) (Ishikawa,
      Figs. 3A-3E, 4A-4E, \xB60081-\xB60100) comprising a first conductive layer (622)
      (Ishikawa, Figs. 3E, 4D, \xB60096-\xB60100) in contact with the semiconductor
      layer (615/613/614) (Ishikawa, Figs. 3E, 4D, \xB60093)  and the sidewall insulating
      layer (612) (Ishikawa, Figs. 3E, 4D, \xB60093) and a second conductive layer
      (624) (Ishikawa, Figs. 3E, 4D, \xB60100) on the first conductive layer (622),
      and wherein width of the first conductive layer (622) is larger than width of
      the second conductive layer (portion of the electrode 624 in the insulating
      layer (623).\\nIt would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the
      art at the time the invention was made to modify the method of Yamazaki by forming
      conductive layers on sidewall insulating layer as taught by Ishikawa to have
      forming an electrode comprising a first conductive layer in contact with the
      oxide semiconductor layer and the sidewall insulating layer and a second conductive
      layer on the first conductive layer, and wherein width of the first conductive
      layer is larger than width of the second conductive layer in order to provide
      thin film transistor that occupies a smaller area, and thus to mount more TFTs
      per unit area of one substrate for high integration (Ishikawa, \xB60099).\\nRegarding
      Claim 12, Yamazaki in view of Iwasaki, Yamazaki (\u2018053)), Lin, and Ishikawa
      discloses the method for manufacturing a semiconductor device according to claim
      8. Further, Yamazaki does not specifically disclose in embodiment of Figs. 41A-41B
      adding dopant to the oxide semiconductor layer using the sidewall insulating
      layer and the gate electrode as a mask. However, Yamazaki teaches an embodiment
      of Fig. 14A, wherein dopant is to be added to the semiconductor layer using
      the sidewall insulating layer (35) (Yamazaki, Figs. 14A, \xB60196) and the gate
      electrode (34) as a mask.\\nIt would have been obvious to a person of ordinary
      skill in the art at the time the invention was made to further modify the method
      of Yamazaki by forming high concentration impurity regions and low number='26'concentration
      impurity regions as taught by Yamazaki to have adding dopant to the oxide semiconductor
      layer using the sidewall insulating layer and the gate electrode as a mask in
      order to provide low concentration regions to lower electric field in the drain
      (Yamazaki, \xB60196).\\nRegarding Claim 13, Yamazaki in view of Iwasaki, Yamazaki
      (\u2018053)), Lin, and Ishikawa discloses the method for manufacturing a semiconductor
      device according to claim 8. Further, Yamazaki does not specifically disclose
      that the oxide semiconductor layer contains indium, gallium and zinc. However,
      Iwasaki discloses a field effect transistor having oxide semiconductor, specifically,
      amorphous oxide including In, Ga, Zn, and O) as a channel layer (11) (Iwasaki,
      Figs. 2, 7A-7C, \xB60091-\xB60093).\\nIt would have been obvious to a person
      of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to further modify
      the method of Yamazaki by forming an oxide semiconductor as a channel layer
      as taught by Iwasaki so that the oxide semiconductor layer contains indium,
      gallium and zinc in order to provide stable electric connection  of channel
      region by forming source/drain regions with higher electric conductivity and
      from an oxide semiconductor material of the channel region, and thus to improve
      the uniformity and reliability of the elements (Iwasaki, \xB60025, \xB60095).\\n
      Regarding Claim 22, Yamazaki in view of Iwasaki, Yamazaki (\u2018053)), Lin,
      and Ishikawa discloses the method for manufacturing a semiconductor device according
      to claim 8. Further, Yamazaki discloses that the second insulating film (depressions
      37 are formed in the first insulating film 31; thus, modified first insulating
      film 31 is interpreted as second insulating film) (Yamazaki, Fig. 41A, \xB60309)
      is formed over a substrate (30) (Yamazaki, Fig. 41A, \xB60063), but does not
      specifically disclose that the projection portion comprises a first flat top
      surface, wherein the depression portion comprises a second flat top surface,
      and wherein the second flat top surface covers a greater area of the substrate
      than the first flat top surface. However, Yamazaki (\u2018053) teaches the method,
      wherein the reinforcement film (103) (Yamazaki (\u2018053), Fig. 4A, \xB60057-\xB60061)
      having a projection portion is formed on the substrate (120), and forming the
      insulating film (104) (Yamazaki (\u2018053), Fig. 4B, \xB60062, \xB60063) so
      as to cover the reinforcement film (103) so that the insulating film (104) includes
      the projection portion and the depression portion, and that the projection portion
      comprises a first flat top surface (a surface adjacent to the island-like semiconductor
      region 106) (Yamazaki (\u2018053), Fig. 4B, \xB60063, \xB60064), wherein the
      depression portion comprises a number='27'second flat top surface (a surface
      between the island-like semiconductor regions 106), and wherein the second flat
      top surface covers a greater area of the substrate than the first flat top surface;
      the insulating film (104) on the reinforcement film (103) serves as the base
      layer functions as a blocking film for preventing impurities from entering from
      the substrate (120) (Yamazaki (\u2018053), Fig. 4B, \xB60063).\\nIt would have
      been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention
      was made to further modify the method of Yamazaki/Iwasaki/Yamazaki (\u2018053))/Lin/Ishikawa
      by forming an insulating film having a projection portion and a depression portion
      as taught by Yamazaki (\u2018053) to have the projection portion that comprises
      a first flat top surface, wherein the depression portion comprises a second
      flat top surface, and wherein the second flat top surface covers a greater area
      of the substrate than the first flat top surface in order to provide a reinforcement
      film arranged to reinforce the semiconductor film and the base layer functions
      as a blocking film for preventing impurities from entering the substrate (Yamazaki
      (\u2018053), \xB60039, \xB60063).\\nRegarding Claim 23, Yamazaki in view of
      Iwasaki, Yamazaki (\u2018053)), Lin, and Ishikawa discloses the method for manufacturing
      a semiconductor device according to claim 8. Further, Yamazaki discloses the
      fourth insulating film (top portions of the insulating layer 36 on sidewalls
      of the semiconductor layer 32) (Yamazaki, Figs. 41B, \xB60310) has a constant
      thickness except for a portion adjacent to the depression portion, but does
      not specifically disclose that after the planarization treatment, the fourth
      insulating film has a constant thickness except for a portion adjacent to the
      projection portion, and wherein the constant thickness is greater than a thickness
      of the portion of the fourth insulating film adjacent to the projection portion.
      However, Yamazaki teaches in embodiments of Figs. 9D, 9E, 9I, 10C, 10D, and
      10F, and 10G, that the insulating layers (62 in Figs. 9D/9I or 63 in Fig. 9E
      or 55 in Figs. 10C or 56 in Figs. 10D/10G) (Yamazaki, \xB600156, \xB60167) adjacent
      to the sidewall portion of the semiconductor layer (32) have convex upward portion
      (62 or 55) with respect to the substrate surface or convex downward portion
      (63 or 56); and that the shapes of the insulating layers are appropriately selected
      depending on concentration, viscosity, composition of the insulating layers.
      Thus, a person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that forming the
      insulating film to cover the sloped sidewalls of the semiconductor layer would
      result in forming the insulating film of a particular shape with a thickness
      that number='28'is greater at the depression portion than a thickness of the
      portion of the insulating film adjacent to the projection portion.\\nIt would
      have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention
      was made to further modify the method of Yamazaki/Iwasaki/Yamazaki (\u2018053))/Lin/Ishikawa
      by forming an insulating film of a particular shape to cover the sloped sidewalls
      of the semiconductor layer as taught by Yamazaki to have after the planarization
      treatment, the fourth insulating film has a constant thickness except for a
      portion adjacent to the projection portion, and wherein the constant thickness
      is greater than a thickness of the portion of the fourth insulating film adjacent
      to the projection portion in order to provide insulating film having appropriately
      selected shape covering end portions of the semiconductor layer, and thus suppress
      a leak current between the semiconductor layer and the gate electrode (Yamazaki,
      \xB60156, \xB60162).\\n Claims 10 and 11 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a)
      as being unpatentable over US 2007/0281400 to Yamazaki in view Iwasaki (US 2010/0084655),
      Yamazaki (\u2018053) (US 2009/0140053), Lin (US Patent No. 6,177,336), and Ishikawa
      (US 2005/0017303) as applied to Claim 8, and further in view of Yamazaki (\u2018949)
      (US 2010/0051949).\\nRegarding Claims 10 and 11, Yamazaki in view of Iwasaki,
      Yamazaki (\u2018053)), Lin, and Ishikawa discloses the semiconductor device
      according to Claim 8. Further, Yamazaki (\u2018053) does not specifically disclose
      that at least one of the first insulating film and the third insulating film
      contains oxygen at a proportion exceeding stoichiometric proportion (as claimed
      in Claim 10); and wherein the third insulating film is a silicon oxide film,
      and wherein the fourth insulating film is an aluminum oxide film (as claimed
      in Claim 11). However, Yamazaki (\u2018949) teaches forming gate insulating
      layer (Yamazaki (\u2018949), \xB60152, \xB60156) subjected to oxygen treatment
      and modified into an oxygen-excess region and in contact with oxide semiconductor
      film; and forming a protective film in a similar manner to the gate insulating
      film as a stack layer comprising silicon oxide film and aluminum oxide film
      \ (Yamazaki (\u2018949), \xB60184).\\nIt would have been obvious to a person
      of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to further modify
      the method of Yamazaki by performing oxygen treatment on the first/third insulating
      layers as taught by Yamazaki (\u2018949) and forming the third/fourth insulating
      film as a protective number='29'film of Yamazaki (\u2018949) so that at least
      one of the first insulating film and the third insulating film contains oxygen
      at a proportion exceeding stoichiometric proportion (as claimed in Claim 10);
      and wherein the third insulating film is a silicon oxide film, and wherein the
      fourth insulating film is an aluminum oxide film (as claimed in Claim 11) in
      order to provide oxygen-excess region in direct contact with oxide semiconductor
      to suppress reduction in reliability and to provide a protective film to prevent
      entry of a contaminant impurity (Yamazaki (\u2018949), \xB60156, \xB60184).\\n
      Claim 15 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over US 2007/0281400
      to Yamazaki in view of Iwasaki (US 2010/0084655), Yamazaki (\u2018053) (US 2009/0140053),
      and Lin (US Patent No. 6,177,336) as applied to Claim 14, and further in view
      of Ishikawa (US 2005/0017303).\\nRegarding Claim 15, Yamazaki in view of Iwasaki,
      Yamazaki (\u2018053)), and Lin discloses the method for manufacturing a semiconductor
      device according to claim 14. Further, Yamazaki does not specifically disclose
      forming an electrode comprising a first conductive layer in contact with the
      oxide semiconductor layer and the sidewall insulating layer and a second conductive
      layer on the first conductive layer, and wherein width of the first conductive
      layer is larger than width of the second conductive layer.\\nHowever, Yamazaki
      teaches embodiments of Fig. 27C, wherein an electrode (164) comprising a first
      conductive layer in contact with the semiconductor layer (Yamazaki, Fig. 27C,
      \xB60259, \xB60263) is formed. Further, Ishikawa teaches forming a transistor
      having an electrode (source/drain electrodes 622/624) (Ishikawa, Figs. 3A-3E,
      4A-4E, \xB60081-\xB60100) comprising a first conductive layer (622) (Ishikawa,
      Figs. 3E, 4D, \xB60096-\xB60100) in contact with the semiconductor layer (615/613/614)
      (Ishikawa, Figs. 3E, 4D, \xB60093)  and the sidewall insulating layer (612)
      (Ishikawa, Figs. 3E, 4D, \xB60093) and a second conductive layer (624) (Ishikawa,
      Figs. 3E, 4D, \xB60100) on the first conductive layer (622), and wherein width
      of the first conductive layer (622) is larger than width of the second conductive
      layer (portion of the electrode 624 in the insulating layer (623).\\nIt would
      have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention
      was made to further modify the method of Yamazaki by forming conductive layers
      on sidewall insulating layer as taught by Ishikawa to have forming an electrode

      (a policy reflected in the statute) so as to prevent the unjustified or improper
      timewise extension of the \u201Cright to exclude\u201D granted by a patent and
      to prevent possible harassment by multiple assignees. A nonstatutory double
      patenting rejection is appropriate where the claims at issue are not identical,
      but at least one examined application claim is not patentably distinct from
      the reference claim(s) because the examined application claim is either anticipated
      by, or would have been obvious over, the reference claim(s). See, e.g., In re
      Berg, 140 F.3d 1428, 46 USPQ2d 1226 (Fed. Cir. 1998); In re Goodman, 11 F.3d
      1046, 29 USPQ2d 2010 (Fed. Cir. 1993); In re Longi, 759 F.2d 887, 225 USPQ 645

      layer 36 on sidewalls of the semiconductor layer 32) (Yamazaki, Figs. 41B, \xB60310)
      has a constant thickness except for a portion adjacent to the depression portion,
      but does not specifically disclose that after the planarization treatment, the
      fourth insulating film has a constant thickness except for a portion adjacent
      to the projection portion, and wherein the constant thickness is greater than
      a thickness of the portion of the fourth insulating film adjacent to the projection
      portion. However, Yamazaki teaches in embodiments of Figs. 9D, 9E, 9I, 10C,
      10D, and 10F, and 10G, that the insulating layers (62 in Figs. 9D/9I or 63 in
      Fig. 9E or 55 in Figs. 10C or 56 in Figs. 10D/10G) (Yamazaki, \xB600156, \xB60167)
      adjacent to the sidewall portion of the semiconductor layer (32) have convex
      upward portion (62 or 55) with respect to the substrate surface or convex downward
      portion (63 or 56); and that the shapes of the insulating layers are appropriately
      selected depending on concentration, viscosity, composition of the insulating
      layers. Thus, a person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that forming
      the insulating film to cover the sloped sidewalls of the semiconductor layer
      would result in forming the insulating film of a particular shape with a thickness
      that is greater at the depression portion than a thickness of the portion of
      the insulating film adjacent to the projection portion.\\nIt would have been
      obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was
      made to further modify the method of Yamazaki/Iwasaki/Yamazaki (\u2018053))/Lin
      by forming an insulating film of a particular shape to cover the sloped sidewalls
      of the semiconductor layer as taught by Yamazaki to number='20'have after the
      planarization treatment, the fourth insulating film has a constant thickness
      except for a portion adjacent to the projection portion, and wherein the constant
      thickness is greater than a thickness of the portion of the fourth insulating
      film adjacent to the projection portion in order to provide insulating film
      having appropriately selected shape covering end portions of the semiconductor
      layer, and thus suppress a leak current between the semiconductor layer and
      the gate electrode (Yamazaki, \xB60156, \xB60162).\\nClaims 4, 5, 17, and 18

      the fourth insulating film is an aluminum oxide film (as claimed in Claim 18).
      However, Yamazaki (\u2018949) teaches forming gate insulating layer (Yamazaki
      (\u2018949), \xB60152, \xB60156) subjected to oxygen treatment and modified
      into an oxygen-excess region and in contact with oxide semiconductor film; and

      dopant to the semiconductor layer using the gate electrode as a mask (forming
      a lightly doped region 218) (Lin, Figs. 2A, Col. 3, lines 47-56); and forming
      a sidewall insulating layer (212) (Lin, Figs. 2A, Col. 3, lines 57-60) in contact
      with the gate electrode after adding the dopant to the oxide semiconductor layer.\\nIt
      would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time
      the invention was made to modify the method of Yamazaki by forming source and
      drain regions using teachings of Yamazaki and Lin and performing a planarization
      treatment on silicon oxide insulating layer as taught by Lin to have planarization

      a first conductive layer in contact with the semiconductor layer (Yamazaki,
      Fig. 27C, \xB60259, \xB60263) is formed. Further, Ishikawa teaches forming a
      transistor having an electrode (source/drain electrodes 622/624) (Ishikawa,
      Figs. 3A-3E, 4A-4E, \xB60081-\xB60100) comprising a first conductive layer (622)
      (Ishikawa, Figs. 3E, 4D, \xB60096-\xB60100) in contact with the semiconductor

      and wherein width of the first conductive layer (622) is larger than width of
      the second conductive layer (portion of the electrode 624 in the insulating

      conductive layers on sidewall insulating layer as taught by Ishikawa to have
      forming an electrode comprising a first conductive layer in contact with the
      oxide semiconductor layer and the sidewall insulating layer and a second conductive
      layer on the first conductive layer, and wherein width of the first conductive
      layer is larger than width of the second conductive layer in order to provide
      thin film transistor that occupies a smaller area, and thus to mount more TFTs
      per unit area of one substrate for high integration (Ishikawa, \xB60099).\\nRegarding
      Claim 12, Yamazaki in view of Iwasaki, Yamazaki (\u2018053)), Lin, and Ishikawa
      discloses the method for manufacturing a semiconductor device according to claim
      8. Further, Yamazaki does not specifically disclose in embodiment of Figs. 41A-41B
      adding dopant to the oxide semiconductor layer using the sidewall insulating
      layer and the gate electrode as a mask. However, Yamazaki teaches an embodiment
      of Fig. 14A, wherein dopant is to be added to the semiconductor layer using
      the sidewall insulating layer (35) (Yamazaki, Figs. 14A, \xB60196) and the gate
      electrode (34) as a mask.\\nIt would have been obvious to a person of ordinary
      skill in the art at the time the invention was made to further modify the method
      of Yamazaki by forming high concentration impurity regions and low number='26'concentration
      impurity regions as taught by Yamazaki to have adding dopant to the oxide semiconductor
      layer using the sidewall insulating layer and the gate electrode as a mask in
      order to provide low concentration regions to lower electric field in the drain
      (Yamazaki, \xB60196).\\nRegarding Claim 13, Yamazaki in view of Iwasaki, Yamazaki
      (\u2018053)), Lin, and Ishikawa discloses the method for manufacturing a semiconductor
      device according to claim 8. Further, Yamazaki does not specifically disclose
      that the oxide semiconductor layer contains indium, gallium and zinc. However,
      Iwasaki discloses a field effect transistor having oxide semiconductor, specifically,
      amorphous oxide including In, Ga, Zn, and O) as a channel layer (11) (Iwasaki,
      Figs. 2, 7A-7C, \xB60091-\xB60093).\\nIt would have been obvious to a person
      of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to further modify
      the method of Yamazaki by forming an oxide semiconductor as a channel layer
      as taught by Iwasaki so that the oxide semiconductor layer contains indium,
      gallium and zinc in order to provide stable electric connection  of channel
      region by forming source/drain regions with higher electric conductivity and
      from an oxide semiconductor material of the channel region, and thus to improve
      the uniformity and reliability of the elements (Iwasaki, \xB60025, \xB60095).\\nRegarding
      Claim 22, Yamazaki in view of Iwasaki, Yamazaki (\u2018053)), Lin, and Ishikawa
      discloses the method for manufacturing a semiconductor device according to claim
      8. Further, Yamazaki discloses that the second insulating film (depressions
      37 are formed in the first insulating film 31; thus, modified first insulating
      film 31 is interpreted as second insulating film) (Yamazaki, Fig. 41A, \xB60309)
      is formed over a substrate (30) (Yamazaki, Fig. 41A, \xB60063), but does not
      specifically disclose that the projection portion comprises a first flat top
      surface, wherein the depression portion comprises a second flat top surface,
      and wherein the second flat top surface covers a greater area of the substrate
      than the first flat top surface. However, Yamazaki (\u2018053) teaches the method,
      wherein the reinforcement film (103) (Yamazaki (\u2018053), Fig. 4A, \xB60057-\xB60061)
      having a projection portion is formed on the substrate (120), and forming the
      insulating film (104) (Yamazaki (\u2018053), Fig. 4B, \xB60062, \xB60063) so
      as to cover the reinforcement film (103) so that the insulating film (104) includes
      the projection portion and the depression portion, and that the projection portion
      comprises a first flat top surface (a surface adjacent to the island-like semiconductor
      region 106) (Yamazaki (\u2018053), Fig. 4B, \xB60063, \xB60064), wherein the
      depression portion comprises a number='27'second flat top surface (a surface
      between the island-like semiconductor regions 106), and wherein the second flat
      top surface covers a greater area of the substrate than the first flat top surface;
      the insulating film (104) on the reinforcement film (103) serves as the base
      layer functions as a blocking film for preventing impurities from entering from
      the substrate (120) (Yamazaki (\u2018053), Fig. 4B, \xB60063).\\nIt would have
      been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention
      was made to further modify the method of Yamazaki/Iwasaki/Yamazaki (\u2018053))/Lin/Ishikawa
      by forming an insulating film having a projection portion and a depression portion
      as taught by Yamazaki (\u2018053) to have the projection portion that comprises
      a first flat top surface, wherein the depression portion comprises a second
      flat top surface, and wherein the second flat top surface covers a greater area
      of the substrate than the first flat top surface in order to provide a reinforcement
      film arranged to reinforce the semiconductor film and the base layer functions
      as a blocking film for preventing impurities from entering the substrate (Yamazaki
      (\u2018053), \xB60039, \xB60063).\\nRegarding Claim 23, Yamazaki in view of
      Iwasaki, Yamazaki (\u2018053)), Lin, and Ishikawa discloses the method for manufacturing
      a semiconductor device according to claim 8. Further, Yamazaki discloses the
      fourth insulating film (top portions of the insulating layer 36 on sidewalls
      of the semiconductor layer 32) (Yamazaki, Figs. 41B, \xB60310) has a constant
      thickness except for a portion adjacent to the depression portion, but does
      not specifically disclose that after the planarization treatment, the fourth
      insulating film has a constant thickness except for a portion adjacent to the
      projection portion, and wherein the constant thickness is greater than a thickness
      of the portion of the fourth insulating film adjacent to the projection portion.
      However, Yamazaki teaches in embodiments of Figs. 9D, 9E, 9I, 10C, 10D, and
      10F, and 10G, that the insulating layers (62 in Figs. 9D/9I or 63 in Fig. 9E
      or 55 in Figs. 10C or 56 in Figs. 10D/10G) (Yamazaki, \xB600156, \xB60167) adjacent
      to the sidewall portion of the semiconductor layer (32) have convex upward portion
      (62 or 55) with respect to the substrate surface or convex downward portion
      (63 or 56); and that the shapes of the insulating layers are appropriately selected
      depending on concentration, viscosity, composition of the insulating layers.
      Thus, a person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that forming the
      insulating film to cover the sloped sidewalls of the semiconductor layer would
      result in forming the insulating film of a particular shape with a thickness
      that number='28'is greater at the depression portion than a thickness of the
      portion of the insulating film adjacent to the projection portion.\\nIt would
      have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention
      was made to further modify the method of Yamazaki/Iwasaki/Yamazaki (\u2018053))/Lin/Ishikawa
      by forming an insulating film of a particular shape to cover the sloped sidewalls
      of the semiconductor layer as taught by Yamazaki to have after the planarization
      treatment, the fourth insulating film has a constant thickness except for a
      portion adjacent to the projection portion, and wherein the constant thickness
      is greater than a thickness of the portion of the fourth insulating film adjacent
      to the projection portion in order to provide insulating film having appropriately
      selected shape covering end portions of the semiconductor layer, and thus suppress
      a leak current between the semiconductor layer and the gate electrode (Yamazaki,
      \xB60156, \xB60162).\\nClaims 10 and 11 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a)
      as being unpatentable over US 2007/0281400 to Yamazaki in view Iwasaki (US 2010/0084655),
      Yamazaki (\u2018053) (US 2009/0140053), Lin (US Patent No. 6,177,336), and Ishikawa
      (US 2005/0017303) as applied to Claim 8, and further in view of Yamazaki (\u2018949)
      (US 2010/0051949).\\nRegarding Claims 10 and 11, Yamazaki in view of Iwasaki,
      Yamazaki (\u2018053)), Lin, and Ishikawa discloses the semiconductor device
      according to Claim 8. Further, Yamazaki (\u2018053) does not specifically disclose
      that at least one of the first insulating film and the third insulating film
      contains oxygen at a proportion exceeding stoichiometric proportion (as claimed
      in Claim 10); and wherein the third insulating film is a silicon oxide film,
      and wherein the fourth insulating film is an aluminum oxide film (as claimed
      in Claim 11). However, Yamazaki (\u2018949) teaches forming gate insulating
      layer (Yamazaki (\u2018949), \xB60152, \xB60156) subjected to oxygen treatment
      and modified into an oxygen-excess region and in contact with oxide semiconductor
      film; and forming a protective film in a similar manner to the gate insulating
      film as a stack layer comprising silicon oxide film and aluminum oxide film
      \ (Yamazaki (\u2018949), \xB60184).\\nIt would have been obvious to a person
      of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to further modify
      the method of Yamazaki by performing oxygen treatment on the first/third insulating
      layers as taught by Yamazaki (\u2018949) and forming the third/fourth insulating
      film as a protective number='29'film of Yamazaki (\u2018949) so that at least
      one of the first insulating film and the third insulating film contains oxygen
      at a proportion exceeding stoichiometric proportion (as claimed in Claim 10);
      and wherein the third insulating film is a silicon oxide film, and wherein the
      fourth insulating film is an aluminum oxide film (as claimed in Claim 11) in
      order to provide oxygen-excess region in direct contact with oxide semiconductor
      to suppress reduction in reliability and to provide a protective film to prevent
      entry of a contaminant impurity (Yamazaki (\u2018949), \xB60156, \xB60184).\\nClaim
      15 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over US 2007/0281400
      to Yamazaki in view of Iwasaki (US 2010/0084655), Yamazaki (\u2018053) (US 2009/0140053),
      and Lin (US Patent No. 6,177,336) as applied to Claim 14, and further in view
      of Ishikawa (US 2005/0017303).\\nRegarding Claim 15, Yamazaki in view of Iwasaki,
      Yamazaki (\u2018053)), and Lin discloses the method for manufacturing a semiconductor
      device according to claim 14. Further, Yamazaki does not specifically disclose
      forming an electrode comprising a first conductive layer in contact with the
      oxide semiconductor layer and the sidewall insulating layer and a second conductive
      layer on the first conductive layer, and wherein width of the first conductive
      layer is larger than width of the second conductive layer.\\nHowever, Yamazaki
      teaches embodiments of Fig. 27C, wherein an electrode (164) comprising a first
      conductive layer in contact with the semiconductor layer (Yamazaki, Fig. 27C,
      \xB60259, \xB60263) is formed. Further, Ishikawa teaches forming a transistor
      having an electrode (source/drain electrodes 622/624) (Ishikawa, Figs. 3A-3E,
      4A-4E, \xB60081-\xB60100) comprising a first conductive layer (622) (Ishikawa,
      Figs. 3E, 4D, \xB60096-\xB60100) in contact with the semiconductor layer (615/613/614)
      (Ishikawa, Figs. 3E, 4D, \xB60093)  and the sidewall insulating layer (612)
      (Ishikawa, Figs. 3E, 4D, \xB60093) and a second conductive layer (624) (Ishikawa,
      Figs. 3E, 4D, \xB60100) on the first conductive layer (622), and wherein width
      of the first conductive layer (622) is larger than width of the second conductive
      layer (portion of the electrode 624 in the insulating layer (623).\\nIt would
      have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention
      was made to further modify the method of Yamazaki by forming conductive layers
      on sidewall insulating layer as taught by Ishikawa to have forming an electrode
      comprising a first conductive layer in contact with the number='30'oxide semiconductor
      layer and the sidewall insulating layer and a second conductive layer on the
      first conductive layer, and wherein width of the first conductive layer is larger
      than width of the second conductive layer in order to provide thin film transistor
      that occupies a smaller area, and thus to mount more TFTs per unit area of one
      substrate for high integration (Ishikawa, \xB60099).\\nResponse to Arguments\\nApplicant's
      arguments filed 01/20/2016 have been fully considered but they are not persuasive.\\nIn
      response to Applicant\u2019s argument that \u201CYamazaki does not teach forming
      a fourth insulating film covering the third insulating film and filling the
      depression portion\u201D (page 13, paragraph 3 of Applicant\u2019s Remarks),
      it is noted that a person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that
      depositing an insulating film (by CVD or ALD) of a particular thickness at a
      particular deposition rate would comprise an initial deposition when a thin
      layer is formed on a surface of a substrate and additional depositions to form
      an insulating film of a particular thickness. Thus, a thin layer formed during
      the initial deposition of the insulating layer (36) (bottom portions of the
      insulating layer 36 (less than 5 nm) on the second insulating film 31 and sidewalls
      of the semiconductor layer 32) (Yamazaki, Figs. 41B, \xB60310) is interpreted
      as a third insulating film; and a layer formed during additional deposition
      of the insulating layer (36) (top portions of the insulating layer 36 (greater
      than 5 nm) on the second insulating film 31 and sidewalls of the semiconductor
      layer 32) (Yamazaki, Figs. 41B, \xB60310) is interpreted as a fourth insulating
      film. Further, claim does not recite that a third insulating layer and a fourth
      insulating film are different layers.\\nIn response to Applicant\u2019s argument
      that \u201CYamazaki \u2018053 does not suggest forming or modifying a single
      film to have a projection and a depression. Instead, Yamazaki \u2018053 only
      potentially appears to teach stacking reinforcement film 103 on substrate 101\u201D
      (page 14, paragraph 2 of Applicant\u2019s Remarks), it is noted that Yamazaki
      \u2018053 teaches the method, wherein the reinforcement film (103) (Yamazaki
      (\u2018053), Fig. 9B, \xB60057-\xB60061) having a projection portion is formed
      on the insulating film (102) (Yamazaki (\u2018053), Fig. 4B, \xB60063); thus,
      the insulating film structure (102/103) is interpreted as a second insulating
      film with a projection portion  (103). Further, Yamazaki teaches modifying the
      first insulating film (31) to have a number='31'depression portion from the
      first insulating film. Thus, the combination Yamazaki/Yamazaki \u2018053 teaches
      \u201Ca second insulating film with a projection portion and a depression portion
      from the first insulating film\u201D.\\nFurther, in response to applicant's
      argument that the references fail to show certain features of applicant\u2019s
      invention, it is noted that the features upon which applicant relies (i.e.,
      \u201Cmodifying a single film to have a projection and a depression\u201D) are
      not recited in the rejected claim(s).  Although the claims are interpreted in
      light of the specification, limitations from the specification are not read
      into the claims.  See In re Van Geuns, 988 F.2d 1181, 26 USPQ2d 1057 (Fed. Cir.
      1993).\\nIn response to Applicant\u2019s argument that \u201CLin does not teach
      \u201Cuntil part of the third insulating film overlapping with the oxide semiconductor
      layer is exposed\u201D (page 15, paragraph 2 of Applicant\u2019s Remarks), it
      is note that Yamazaki teaches performing etching on the fourth insulating film
      (top portions of the insulating layer 36 are etched as shown in Fig. 41B) until
      part of the third insulating film (bottom portions of the insulating layer 36)
      overlapping with the semiconductor layer (32) is exposed. Thus, it would have
      been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention
      was made to modify the method of Yamazaki by forming source and drain regions
      using teachings of Yamazaki and Lin and performing a planarization treatment
      on silicon oxide insulating layer as taught by Lin to have planarization treatment
      on the fourth insulating film until part of the third insulating film overlapping
      with the oxide semiconductor layer is exposed.\\nRegarding dependent claims
      3-7, 9-13, 15-25 which depend on the independent Claim 2, 8, and 14, the Examiner
      respectfully submits that the applicant\u2019s arguments with respect to dependent
      claims are not persuasive for the above reasons, thus, the rejections of the
      dependent claims are sustained.\\nConclusion\\nTHIS ACTION IS MADE FINAL.  Applicant
      is reminded of the extension of time policy as set forth in 37 CFR 1.136(a).
      \ \\nA shortened statutory period for reply to this final action is set to expire

      Nagase, as applied to claim 1 above, and further in view of Jaura et al. (US
      7,172,831).\\nIn re claims 2 and 9, Nagase differs in that it does not disclose
      air passing both to the fan and downstream of a fan. Attention, however, is
      directed to Jaura which teaches a fan both upstream and downstream of the battery
      cells (fig. 5) and that air flow passes over some of said battery modules to
      a fan and airflow downstream of a fan also passes over battery modules (fig.
      5). Accordingly, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the
      art at the time of invention to modify the apparatus as disclosed by Nagase
      to have air pass to and downstream from the fans to better control air flow.\\nIn
      re claim 3, the examiner notes that as the fans of Jaura are reversible, they
      are structurally capable of pulling air in a first direction for a first period
      of time and then reverse flow and pull air in an opposed direction for a second
      period of time.\\nIn re claim 4, the examiner takes the position that it would
      have been obvious to one having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention
      was made to have the periods of time to be less than a minute, since it has
      been held that where the general conditions of a claim are disclosed in the
      prior art, discovering the optimum or workable ranges involves only routine
      skill in the art. \\nIn re claims 5 and 10, Nagase differs in that it does not
      disclose the fan is in the center of said battery modules. Attention, however,
      is directed to Jaura which teaches the fan is positioned in the center of said
      battery modules (fig. 5, central location of the edge). Accordingly, it would
      have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of invention
      to modify the apparatus as disclosed by Jaura with the fan positioned in a center

      re claims 6-7 and 11, Nagase differs in that it does not explicitly teach a
      supply of cooling liquid is selectively connected to the heat exchanger. Attention,
      however, is directed to Smith which teaches selectively connecting cooling liquid
      to the heat exchanger and the use of valves to selectively allow or bypass the
      flow of cooling fluid to the heat exchanger (claim 1; col. 4, ln 4-18). Accordingly,
      it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to modify the
      apparatus as disclosed by Nagase with a supply of cooling liquid selectively
      connected to the heat exchanger, in view of the teachings of Smith, to keep
      the battery temperature low enough that the battery life is not reduced.\\nIn

      at an intermediate location within the battery pack (fig. 6) and pulling air
      over some of a plurality of battery modules over said heat exchanger and then
      over another group of said plurality of battery modules to cool the battery
      modules (fig. 10).\\n Claim 14 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable

      continued examination under 37 CFR 1.114, including the fee set forth in 37
      CFR 1.17(e), was filed in this application after final rejection.  Since this
      application is eligible for continued examination under 37 CFR 1.114, and the
      fee set forth in 37 CFR 1.17(e) has been timely paid, the finality of the previous
      Office action has been withdrawn pursuant to 37 CFR 1.114.  Applicant's submission
      filed on 6/27/2014 has been entered.\\n \\nResponse to Arguments\\nApplicant\u2019s
      arguments with respect to claims 1-20 have been considered but are moot in view
      of the new ground(s) of rejection; further the he examiner respectfully notes
      the following:  \\nThe examiner respectfully disagrees with applicant\u2019s
      arguments with respect to Singh\u2019s teaches of \\\"an available quantity
      of each of the plurality of products in an inventory of the distributor\\\"
      nor the \\\"product inventory information.\\\"  The examiner notes Singh teaches
      product inventory information and further \\\"an available quantity of each
      of the plurality of products in an inventory of the distributor\\\" (see at
      least, [0046] and [0049] \u2013 \u201Cquantity reservation\u201D: function may
      be trigged... to prevent the quality of the product included in the listing
      from being otherwise disposed (i.e., as reasonably constructed \u201Cquantity
      reservation\u201D and especially preventing disposition would require an available
      quantity of inventory)).  None the less, the examiner further notes newly cited
      reference Sacco teaches the use of sored product information  and stored product
      inventory information to fill in a plurality of fields include dint he listing
      template.  \\nApplicant\u2019s arguments with respect to Examiner\u2019s Official
      Notice are found not persuasive.  The examiner notes the applicant has not traversed
      the official notice adequately, more specifically; the applicant has failed
      to \u201Cpoint out the supposed errors in the examiner\u2019s action, which
      would include stating why the noticed fact is not considered to be common knowledge
      or well-known in the art.\u201D  Therefore the examiner notes the subject matter
      of the Official Notices of Claims 4-5 13-14, and 20  are admitted prior art,
      as previously noted. \\n\\nOfficial Notice\\n           The examiner notes:\\n\u201CTo
      adequately traverse such a finding, an applicant must specifically point out
      the supposed errors in the examiner\u2019s action, which would include stating
      why the noticed fact is not considered to be common knowledge or well-known
      in the art. See 37 CFR 1.111(b). See also Chevenard, 139 F.2d at 713, 60 USPQ
      at 241 (\u201C[I]n the absence of any demand by appellant for the examiner to
      produce authority for his statement, we will not consider this contention.\u201D).
      A general allegation that the claims define a patentable invention without any
      reference to the examiner\u2019s assertion of official notice would be inadequate.
      If applicant adequately traverses the examiner\u2019s assertion of official
      notice, the examiner must provide documentary evidence in the next Office action
      if the rejection is to be maintained. See 37 CFR 1.104(c)(2). See also Zurko,
      258 F.3d at 1386, 59 USPQ2d at 1697 (\u201C[T]he Board [or examiner] must point
      to some concrete evidence in the record in support of these findings\u201D to
      satisfy the substantial evidence test). If the  examiner is relying on personal
      knowledge to support the finding of what is known in the art, the examiner must
      provide an affidavit or declaration setting forth specific factual statements
      and explanation to support the finding. See 37 CFR 1.104(d)(2).\\nIf applicant
      does not traverse the examiner\u2019s assertion of official notice or applicant\u2019s
      traverse is not adequate, the examiner should clearly indicate in the next Office
      action that the common knowledge or well-known in the art statement is taken
      to be admitted prior art because applicant either failed to traverse the examiner\u2019s
      assertion of official notice or that the traverse was inadequate. If the traverse
      was inadequate, the examiner should include an explanation as to why it was
      inadequate.\u201D\\nThe examiner notes the applicant has not traversed the official
      notice adequately, more specifically; the applicant has failed to \u201Cpoint
      out the supposed errors in the examiner\u2019s action, which would include stating
      why the noticed fact is not considered to be common knowledge or well-known
      in the art.\u201D  Therefore the examiner notes the subject matter of the Official
      Notices of Claims 4-5 13-14, and 20  are admitted prior art.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n
      Claim Rejections - 35 USC \xA7 101\\n35 U.S.C. 101 reads as follows:\\nWhoever
      invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition
      of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor,
      subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.\\n\\n\\nClaims 1-20
      are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 101 because the claimed invention is directed to
      a judicial exception (i.e., a law of nature, a natural phenomenon, or an abstract
      idea) without significantly more. Claims 1-20 relate to a fundamental economic
      practice (i.e. sales by creation of listing).\\nThe claims do not recite additional
      elements that are sufficient to amount to \\\"significantly more\\\" than the
      judicial exception because: the claims do not recite an improvement to another
      technology or technical field, an improvement to the functioning of a computer
      itself, or meaningful limitations beyond generally linking the use of an abstract
      idea to a generic computer to perform generic computer functions that are well-understood,
      routine and conventional activities previously known to the industry does not
      qualify as \\\"significantly more.\\\" Therefore, Claims 1-20 are directed to
      non-statutory subject matter,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Claim Rejections - 35
      USC \xA7 103\\nThe following is a quotation of pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) which

      A patent may not be obtained though the invention is not identically disclosed
      or described as set forth in section 102 of this title, if the differences between
      the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the
      subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention

      A1) as applied to the respective claims above, and further in view of Examiner\u2019s
      Official Notice.\\n\\nClaim 5, 13, 16, 20\\nSingh and Sacco and Racco fails
      to disclose:\\n[Claim 4] further comprising receiving product fitment data from
      the catalog service.\\n [Claim 5] wherein the product fitment data identifies
      a plurality of devices with which the product is operable.\\n[Claim 13] wherein
      the catalog service provides product information associated with a plurality
      of products manufactured by a plurality of entities.\\nThe examiner takes Official
      Notice that it is old and well known in the Catalog Arts to provide (Claim 13)
      product information from multiple manufactures, such product information can
      include (Claim 4) fitment data which can (Claim 5) identify devices with which
      the product is operable (i.e., Computer Catalog containing expansion cards from
      multiple manufactures and the fitment compatibly for respective compatible devices)
      .\\nIt would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time
      the invention was made to modify the teachings of Singh and Sacco and Racco
      to include the features of Examiner\u2019s Official Notice as taught above,
      for the purpose of combining prior art elements according to known methods to
      yield predictable results. One of ordinary skill in the art would have been
      motivated to combine the teachings in order to provide pertinent information
      to a user to thereby make the user experience overall more satisfying.  \\n\\nClaim
      14\\nSingh and Sacco and Racco fails to disclose:\\nwherein a plurality of distributors
      are associated with the catalog service, and each of the plurality of distributors
      accesses the same product information provided by the catalog service.\\nThe
      examiner takes Official Notice that it is old and well known in the Catalog
      Arts to provide to have multiple different entities share a Catalog of items
      that are sharable among the entities (e.g., different companies may share the
      same inventory of items in a catalog)\\nIt would have been obvious to one of
      ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to modify the teachings
      of Singh and Sacco and Racco to include the features of Examiner\u2019s Official
      Notice as taught above, for the purpose of combining prior art elements according
      to known methods to yield predictable results. One of ordinary skill in the
      art would have been motivated to combine the teachings in order to provide less
      overhead cost for a company to maintain it\u2019s own inventory.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion\\nAny

      unpatentable over Emery et al (US 6,274,664) in view of Evonik Industries, Specialty
      Silica (p 1-36, 2/2012) and GB 2,311,535.\\nEmery et al teach a free-flowing
      granular polymer composition suitable for incorporation into a particulate detergent
      composition comprising a defined dye-transfer inhibiting polymer, and a silica
      based carrier material.  A preferred carrier material is an acidic silica.  The
      silica-based carrier material may optionally contain a solid acid, for example,
      polyacrylic acid or phthalic acid.  See Abstract.  Preferred silica materials
      include Sipernat 50, Gasil 200 TP, etc.  See column 3, lines 40-69.  Note that,
      as evidenced by Evonik Industries, Sipernat 50 has a surface area of 475 m2/g,
      a particle size of 40 microns, and a tamped density of 180 g/l which clearly
      falls within the scope of instant claims 4, 7, and 8.  The granular polymers
      may be incorporated into particulate laundry detergent compositions, suitable
      in amounts equivalent to a content of the dye transfer inhibitor of from 0.01
      to 10% by weight.  The term particulate laundry detergent composition includes
      powders or granular products of any bulk density.  See column 3, line 20 to
      column 5, line 30.  Bleaches and bleach stabilizers may be used in the compositions.
      \ Suitable bleach stabilizers (heavy metal sequestrant) include ethylene diamine
      tetraacetate (EDTA), ethylenediamine disuccinate (EDDS), etc.  See column 7,
      lines 35-69.  Specifically, Emery et al teach granules containing, for example
      38.6% Sipernat 50, which were incorporated at 2.5% by weight into detergent
      powder  compositions.  See column 9, lines 35-65.  Further, the compositions
      may additionally contain a powder structurant, for example, a fatty acid (or
      fatty acid soap), etc., in amounts from 1 to 5% by weight.  See column 8, lines
      1-20.  \\nEmery et al do not teach the use of a ratio of an aminocarboxylate,
      such as EDTA to additive or a composition containing one or more aminocarboxylates,
      an additive such as pyrogenic or precipitated silica, at least one solid auxiliary,
      and the other requisite components of the composition in the specific amounts
      as recited by the instant claims.  \\n\u2018535 teaches detergent compositions
      that contain a builder or surfactant; and an amino tricarboxylic acid.  See
      Abstract.  The detergent composition may contain heavy metal ion sequestrants
      in amounts from 0.005% to 20% by weight and include ethylenediamine tetraacetic
      acid, ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid, etc.  See pages 37-39.  \\nIt would
      have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art, at the time the invention
      was made, to use, for example, 10% by weight of a heavy metal ion sequestrant
      in the composition taught by Emery et al, with a reasonable expectation of success,
      because \u2019535 teaches the use of heavy metal ion sequestrants in a similar
      composition in amounts of, for example, 10% by weight and further Emery et al
      teach the use of heavy metal ion sequestrants in general.  \\nNote that, the
      Examiner asserts that the teachings of Emery et al in combination with '535
      would suggest compositions having the same ratio of aminocarboxylate to additive
      as recited by the instant claims.  \\n It would have been obvious to one of
      ordinary skill in the art, at the time the invention was made, to formulate
      a composition containing one or more aminocarboxylates, an additive such as
      pyrogenic or precipitated silica, at least one solid auxiliary, and the other
      requisite components of the composition in the specific amounts as recited by
      the instant claims, with a reasonable expectation of success, because the broad
      teachings of '535 in combination with Evonik Industries and '535 suggest a composition
      containing one or more aminocarboxylates, an additive such as pyrogenic or precipitated
      silica, at least one solid auxiliary, and the other requisite components of
      the composition in the specific amounts as recited by the instant claims.  \\n

      being unpatentable over Yang et al (US 2004/0052736).\\nYang et al teach a dentrifice
      composition containing from 1% to about 50% by weight of talc, 5% to 50% by
      weight of an abrasive, 30% to 90% of water, etc.  See claim 1.  Additionally,
      the composition may contain from 0.1% to 20% by weight of a chelating agent
      such as EDTA, etc.  See claims 4 and 5.  Suitable abrasive materials include
      silicas such as precipitated silica or silica gels having a particle size ranging
      between about 0.1 to about 30 microns, etc.  Note that, the Examiner asserts
      the broad teachings of Yang et al would suggest precipitated silica or silica
      gels having the same surface area and tamped density as recited by the instant
      claims because the silicas are the same as recited by the instant claims and
      as described in the instant specification.  \\nYang et al do not teach, with
      sufficient specificity, a composition containing composition containing one
      or more aminocarboxylates, an additive such as pyrogenic  or precipitated silica,
      at least one solid auxiliary, and the other requisite components of the composition
      in the specific amounts as recited by the instant claims.\\nNevertheless, it

      a patent granted on an application for patent by another filed in the United
      States before the invention by the applicant for patent, except that an international
      application filed under the treaty defined in section 351(a) shall have the
      effects for purposes of this subsection of an application filed in the United
      States only if the international application designated the United States and
      was published under Article 21(2) of such treaty in the English language.\\n\\n\\n(e)
      the invention was described in a patent granted on an application for patent
      by another filed in the United States before the invention thereof by the applicant
      for patent, or on an international application by another who has fulfilled
      the requirements of paragraphs (1), (2), and (4) of section 371(c) of this title
      before the invention thereof by the applicant for patent.\\n\\n\\nThe changes
      made to 35 U.S.C. 102(e) by the American Inventors Protection Act of 1999 (AIPA)
      and the Intellectual Property and High Technology Technical Amendments Act of
      2002 do not apply when the reference is a U.S. patent resulting directly or
      indirectly from an international application filed before November 29, 2000.
      \ Therefore, the prior art date of the reference is determined under 35 U.S.C.
      102(e) prior to the amendment by the AIPA (pre-AIPA 35 U.S.C. 102(e)).\\nClaim
      Rejections - 35 USC \xA7 103\\nThe following is a quotation of pre-AIA  35 U.S.C.
      103(a) which forms the basis for all obviousness rejections set forth in this
      Office action:\\n(a) A patent may not be obtained though the invention is not
      identically disclosed or described as set forth in section 102 of this title,
      if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the
      prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious
      at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the
      art to which said subject matter pertains.  Patentability shall not be negatived
      by the manner in which the invention was made.\\n\\n\\nThe factual inquiries
      set forth in Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 148 USPQ 459 (1966), that
      are applied for establishing a background for determining obviousness under
      pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) are summarized as follows:\\n1. Determining the scope
      and contents of the prior art.\\n2. Ascertaining the differences between the
      prior art and the claims at issue.\\n3. Resolving the level of ordinary skill
      in the pertinent art.\\n4. Considering objective evidence present in the application
      indicating obviousness or nonobviousness.\\nThis application currently names
      joint inventors. In considering patentability of the claims under pre-AIA  35
      U.S.C. 103(a), the examiner presumes that the subject matter of the various
      claims was commonly owned at the time any inventions covered therein were made
      absent any evidence to the contrary.  Applicant is advised of the obligation
      under 37 CFR 1.56 to point out the inventor and invention dates of each claim
      that was not commonly owned at the time a later invention was made in order
      for the examiner to  consider the applicability of pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(c)
      and potential pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 102(e), (f) or (g) prior art under pre-AIA
      \ 35 U.S.C. 103(a).\\nClaims 1-5, 7, 8, 13, and 16 are rejected under pre-AIA
      \ 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Emery et al (US 6,274,664) in
      view of Evonik Industries, Specialty Silica (p 1-36, 2/2012) and GB 2,311,535.\\nEmery
      et al teach a free-flowing granular polymer composition suitable for incorporation
      into a particulate detergent composition comprising a defined dye-transfer inhibiting
      polymer, and a silica based carrier material.  A preferred carrier material
      is an acidic silica.  The silica-based carrier material may optionally contain
      a solid acid, for example, polyacrylic acid or phthalic acid.  See Abstract.
      \ Preferred silica materials include Sipernat 50, Gasil 200 TP, etc.  See column
      3, lines 40-69.  Note that, as evidenced by Evonik Industries, Sipernat 50 has
      a surface area of 475 m2/g, a particle size of 40 microns, and a tamped density
      of 180 g/l which clearly falls within the scope of instant claims 4, 7, and
      8.  The granular polymers may be incorporated into particulate laundry detergent
      compositions, suitable in amounts equivalent to a content of the dye transfer
      inhibitor of from 0.01 to 10% by weight.  The term particulate laundry detergent
      composition includes powders or granular products of any bulk density.  See
      column 3, line 20 to column 5, line 30.  Bleaches and bleach stabilizers may
      be used in the compositions.  Suitable bleach stabilizers (heavy metal sequestrant)
      include ethylene diamine tetraacetate (EDTA), ethylenediamine disuccinate (EDDS),
      etc.  See column 7, lines 35-69.  Specifically, Emery et al teach granules containing,
      for example 38.6% Sipernat 50, which were incorporated at 2.5% by weight into
      detergent powder  compositions.  See column 9, lines 35-65.  Further, the compositions
      may additionally contain a powder structurant, for example, a fatty acid (or
      fatty acid soap), etc., in amounts from 1 to 5% by weight.  See column 8, lines
      1-20.  \\nEmery et al do not teach the use of a ratio of an aminocarboxylate,
      such as EDTA to additive or a composition containing one or more aminocarboxylates,
      an additive such as pyrogenic or precipitated silica, at least one solid auxiliary,
      and the other requisite components of the composition in the specific amounts
      as recited by the instant claims.  \\n\u2018535 teaches detergent compositions
      that contain a builder or surfactant; and an amino tricarboxylic acid.  See
      Abstract.  The detergent composition may contain heavy metal ion sequestrants
      in amounts from 0.005% to 20% by weight and include ethylenediamine tetraacetic
      acid, ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid, etc.  See pages 37-39.  \\nIt would
      have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art, at the time the invention
      was made, to use, for example, 10% by weight of a heavy metal ion sequestrant
      in the composition taught by Emery et al, with a reasonable expectation of success,
      because \u2019535 teaches the use of heavy metal ion sequestrants in a similar
      composition in amounts of, for example, 10% by weight and further Emery et al
      teach the use of heavy metal ion sequestrants in general.  \\nNote that, the
      Examiner asserts that the teachings of Emery et al in combination with '535
      would suggest compositions having the same ratio of aminocarboxylate to additive
      as recited by the instant claims.  \\n It would have been obvious to one of
      ordinary skill in the art, at the time the invention was made, to formulate
      a composition containing one or more aminocarboxylates, an additive such as
      pyrogenic or precipitated silica, at least one solid auxiliary, and the other
      requisite components of the composition in the specific amounts as recited by
      the instant claims, with a reasonable expectation of success, because the broad
      teachings of '535 in combination with Evonik Industries and '535 suggest a composition
      containing one or more aminocarboxylates, an additive such as pyrogenic or precipitated
      silica, at least one solid auxiliary, and the other requisite components of
      the composition in the specific amounts as recited by the instant claims.  \\nClaims
      1, 3-5, 7, 8, and 13 are rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable
      over Yang et al (US 2004/0052736).\\nYang et al teach a dentrifice composition
      containing from 1% to about 50% by weight of talc, 5% to 50% by weight of an
      abrasive, 30% to 90% of water, etc.  See claim 1.  Additionally, the composition
      may contain from 0.1% to 20% by weight of a chelating agent such as EDTA, etc.
      \ See claims 4 and 5.  Suitable abrasive materials include silicas such as precipitated
      silica or silica gels having a particle size ranging between about 0.1 to about
      30 microns, etc.  Note that, the Examiner asserts the broad teachings of Yang
      et al would suggest precipitated silica or silica gels having the same surface
      area and tamped density as recited by the instant claims because the silicas
      are the same as recited by the instant claims and as described in the instant
      specification.  \\nYang et al do not teach, with sufficient specificity, a composition
      containing composition containing one or more aminocarboxylates, an additive
      such as pyrogenic  or precipitated silica, at least one solid auxiliary, and
      the other requisite components of the composition in the specific amounts as
      recited by the instant claims.\\nNevertheless, it would have been obvious to
      one of ordinary skill in the art, at the time the invention was made, to formulate
      a composition containing one or more aminocarboxylates, an additive such as
      pyrogenic or precipitated silica, at least one solid auxiliary, and the other
      requisite components of the composition in the specific amounts as recited by
      the instant claims, with a reasonable expectation of success, because the broad
      teachings of '535 in combination with Evonik Industries and '535 suggest a composition
      containing one or more aminocarboxylates, an additive such as pyrogenic or precipitated
      silica, at least one solid auxiliary, and the other requisite components of
      the composition in the specific amounts as recited by the instant claims.  \\nAllowable
      Subject Matter\\nClaims 14, 15, and 17 are objected to as being dependent upon
      a rejected base claim, but would be allowable if rewritten in independent form
      including all of the limitations of the base claim and any intervening claims.\\n
      Response to Arguments\\nWith respect to the rejection of the instant claims
      under 35 USC 103 using Emery et al in view of Evonik Industries and GB 2,311,535,
      Applicant states that the claimed ratio of aminocarboxylate to additive is not
      disclosed or suggested.  Additionally, Applicant states that the problem addressed
      in \u2018535 is totally different from the one described in the present application;
      it deals with deposit formation by inclusion of amino tricarboxylic acids into
      a wash solution during early stages of a wash and a  person skilled in the art
      would not have referred to '535 in order to solve the problem at hand - improving
      the storage stability of powders, pellets, and/or granules.  Further, Applicant
      states that while both Emery et al or \u2018535 teach the use of an aminocarboxylate
      such as EDTA, none of the examples disclosed by Emery et al or '535 teach the
      use of an aminocarboxylate such as EDTA.  In response, note that, the Examiner
      asserts that the teachings of a reference are not limited to the preferred embodiments
      and that both Emery et al or '535 clearly suggest the use of EDTA as recited
      by the instant claims.  Note that, the fact that a specific embodiment is taught
      to be preferred is not controlling, since all disclosures of the prior art,
      including unpreferred embodiments, must be considered.  Merck & Co., Inc. v.
      Biocraft Labs., Inc., 874 F.2d 804, 807 (Fed. Cir. 1989).  Additionally, disclosed
      examples and preferred embodiments do not constitute a teaching away from a
      broader disclosure or nonpreferred embodiments.  In re Susi, 440 F.2d 442, 169
      USPQ 423 (CCPA 1971); a known or obvious composition does not become patentable
      simply because it has been described as somewhat inferior to some other product
      for the same use.  In re Gurley, 27 F.3d 551, 554, 31 USPQ2d 1130, 1132 (Fed.
      Cir. 1994); See MPEP 2123(II).  \\nAlso, while Emery et al or '535 do not specifically
      discuss the storage stability properties of the aminocarboxylate (i.e., EDTA),
      the reason or motivation to modify the reference may often suggest what the
      inventor has done, but for a different purpose or to solve a different problem.
      \ It is not necessary that the prior art suggest the combination to achieve
      the same advantage or result discovered by applicant.  Note that, while there
      must be motivation to make the claimed invention, there is no  requirement that
      the prior art provide the same reason as the applicant to make the claimed invention.
      \ In re Linter, 458 F.2d 1013, 173 USPQ 560 (CCPA 1972).  See MPEP 2144.  The
      Examiner asserts that \u2018535 is analogous prior art relative to Emery et
      al and that one of ordinary skill in the art clearly would have looked to the
      teachings of '535 to cure the deficiencies of Emery et al.  '535 is a secondary
      reference relied upon for its teaching of the specific amount of EDTA present
      in the composition.  The Examiner asserts that one of ordinary skill in the
      art clearly would have been motivated to use, for example, 10% by weight of
      a heavy metal ion sequestrant such as EDTA in the composition taught by Emery
      et al, with a reasonable expectation of success, because \u2019535 teaches the
      use of heavy metal ion sequestrants in a similar composition in amounts of,
      for example, 10% by weight and further Emery et al teach the use of heavy metal
      ion sequestrants such as EDTA in general.   Note that, the Examiner asserts
      that a composition containing, for example, 10% by weight of EDTA and 2.5% by
      weight of particles containing 38.6% of Sipernat 50 which would equal 0.965%
      of Sipernat 50 as taught by Emery et al in combination with \u2018535 would
      result in a ratio of aminocarboxylate to additive of 10.36:1 and would clearly
      fall within the ratio as recited by the instant claims.  Thus, the Examiner
      asserts that the teachings of Emery et al in view of Evonik Industries and '535
      are sufficient to render the claimed invention obvious under 35 USC 103.   \\nConclusion\\nTHIS
      ACTION IS MADE FINAL.  Applicant is reminded of the extension of time policy
      as set forth in 37 CFR 1.136(a).  \\nnumber='10'A shortened statutory period

      1-16 and 18-21 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 (a) as being unpatentable over
      Anglin et al (U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2011/0016095) in view
      of Haas et al (U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2009/0234795).\\nAs to
      claim 1, Giroti teaches a method for conducting and recording transactions remotely
      (see abstract, figures 1 and 1a, page 3 pars. 0055-0056, and page 4 pars. 0065-0066)
      comprising: establishing a media conference between a plurality of media conferencing
      terminals (page 1 par. 0003, and page 2 par. 0018 and par. 0023 lines 1- 9);linking
      a plurality of computers each operable to display a digital document synchronized
      by a transaction session (see abstract, and page 2 par. 0023 lines 15-27); recording
      the conference data inputted on one or more of the plurality of computers (page
      6 par. 0084, and page 7 par. 0092); storing the digital document; and storing
      audio data and/or video data corresponding to the media conference, wherein
      the audio data and/or video data is processed to enable the identification of
      one or more participants of the media conference (page 6 pars. 0083-0084, and
      page 7 pars. 0092-0097).\\nHowever, Giroti does not teach that recording a plurality
      of annotations inputted on one or more of the plurality of computers; creating
      an authentication file that authenticates the digital document by: storing the
      plurality of annotations; and storing audio data and/or video data corresponding
      to the media conference, wherein the audio data and/or video data is processed
      to enable the identification of one or more participants of the media conference
      and to verify the identification of the one or more participants of the media
      conference.\\nChoi teaches that recording a plurality of annotations inputted
      on one or more of the plurality of computers (figures 6 and 10, and page 3 par.
      0049); creating an authentication file that authenticates the digital document
      by: storing the plurality of annotations; and storing audio data and/or video
      data corresponding to the media conference, wherein the audio data and/or video
      data is processed to enable the identification of one or more participants of
      the media conference and to verify the  identification of the one or more participants
      of the media conference (page 1 par. 0018, page 2 par. 0045, and page 3 par.
      0048-0049).\\nIt would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art
      at the time the invention was made to incorporate the teaching of Choi stated
      above in the method of Giroti for creating an authentication file that authenticates
      the digital document because it would have improved the security of conference
      data and provided effectively simulate the physical environment while maintaining
      the flexibility and convenience of on-line conference.\\nAs to claims 2-3, Giroti
      teaches the further step of printing of the digital document using a printing
      means, the further step of using a printing means that is a laser printer or
      inkjet printer (figure 16, and page 5 par. 0075). \\nAs to claim 4, Giroti teaches
      that the further step of the computer recording a pressure, a speed, and an
      acceleration of each of the plurality of annotations (figures 15 and 20, page
      5 par. 0072, and page 8 par. 0100).\\nAs to claims 5-6, Giroti teaches the further
      step of printing the plurality of annotations using a printing means that is
      operable to replicate the pressure, the speed, the acceleration of each of the
      plurality of inputted annotations (figures 15-16, and page 5 pars. 0072 and
      0075). \\nAs to claim 7, Giroti teaches that the further step of pairing the
      one ormore of the plurality of computers on a common device with one or more
      of the mediaconferencing terminals (see summary, figure 1, and page 3 pars.
      0055-0056).\\n As to claim 8, it is also rejected for the same reasons set forth
      to rejecting claim 1 above, since claims 8 is merely an apparatus for the method
      of operations defined in the method claim 1, and claim 8 does not define or
      teach any new limitation than claim 1. Additionally, Giroti discloses a transaction
      system comprising: a plurality of computers each including an input means, a
      display means, a network connection and a media recording means; a plurality
      of media conferencing terminals each including an input means and an output
      means; and a transaction utility linked to each of the plurality of computers
      or loaded on the plurality of computers (see summary, figure 1, and page 3 pars.
      0055-0056).\\nAs to claims 9-10, Giroti discloses that the input means of the
      computer is a stylus and operable to generate a pressure, a speed, and an acceleration
      corresponding to its use (figures 15-16, and page 5 pars. 0072 and 0075).\\nAs
      to claims 11-12, Giroti discloses that the display means is a monitor and avideo
      projector (figure 16, and page 5 par.0075).\\nAs to claims 13-14, Giroti discloses
      that the input means of the media conferencing terminal is a camera and the
      output means is a plurality of audio speakers (figures 6-9, and pages 3-4 pars.
      0060-0062).\\nAs to claims 15-16, Giroti discloses that the output means further
      comprises a video monitor and a video projector (figure 28, and page 9 pars.
      0112-0113). \\n As to claims 17-21, they are also rejected for the same reasons
      set forth to rejecting claims 1-7 above, since claims 17-21 are merely an apparatus
      for the method of operations defined in the method claims 1-7, and claims 17-21
      do not define or teach any new limitation than claims 1-7.\\n\"],\n        \"sections.submissionDate\":\"2012-10-03T04:00:00Z\",\n

      Code not included in this action can be found in a prior Office action.\\n\\nClaims
      1-16 and 18-21 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 (a) as being unpatentable over
      Anglin et al (U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2011/0016095) in view
      of Haas et al (U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2009/0234795).\\n\\nAs
      to claim 1, Giroti teaches a method for conducting and recording transactions
      remotely (see abstract, figures 1 and 1a, page 3 pars. 0055-0056, and page 4
      pars. 0065-0066) comprising: establishing a media conference between a plurality
      of media conferencing terminals (page 1 par. 0003, and page 2 par. 0018 and
      par. 0023 lines 1- 9);linking a plurality of computers each operable to display
      a digital document synchronized by a transaction session (see abstract, and
      page 2 par. 0023 lines 15-27); recording the conference data inputted on one
      or more of the plurality of computers (page 6 par. 0084, and page 7 par. 0092);
      storing the digital document; and storing audio data and/or video data corresponding
      to the media conference, wherein the audio data and/or video data is processed
      to enable the identification of one or more participants of the media conference
      (page 6 pars. 0083-0084, and page 7 pars. 0092-0097).\\nHowever, Giroti does
      not teach that recording a plurality of annotations inputted on one or more
      of the plurality of computers; creating an authentication file that authenticates
      the digital document by: storing the plurality of annotations; and storing audio
      data and/or video data corresponding to the media conference, wherein the audio
      data and/or video data is processed to enable the identification of one or more
      participants of the media conference and to verify the identification of the
      one or more participants of the media conference.\\nChoi teaches that recording
      a plurality of annotations inputted on one or more of the plurality of computers
      (figures 6 and 10, and page 3 par. 0049); creating an authentication file that
      authenticates the digital document by: storing the plurality of annotations;
      and storing audio data and/or video data corresponding to the media conference,
      wherein the audio data and/or video data is processed to enable the identification
      of one or more participants of the media conference and to verify the  identification
      of the one or more participants of the media conference (page 1 par. 0018, page
      2 par. 0045, and page 3 par. 0048-0049).\\nIt would have been obvious to one
      of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to incorporate
      the teaching of Choi stated above in the method of Giroti for creating an authentication
      file that authenticates the digital document because it would have improved
      the security of conference data and provided effectively simulate the physical
      environment while maintaining the flexibility and convenience of on-line conference.\\n\\nAs
      to claims 2-3, Giroti teaches the further step of printing of the digital document
      using a printing means, the further step of using a printing means that is a
      laser printer or inkjet printer (figure 16, and page 5 par. 0075). \\n\\nAs
      to claim 4, Giroti teaches that the further step of the computer recording a
      pressure, a speed, and an acceleration of each of the plurality of annotations
      (figures 15 and 20, page 5 par. 0072, and page 8 par. 0100).\\n\\nAs to claims
      5-6, Giroti teaches the further step of printing the plurality of annotations
      using a printing means that is operable to replicate the pressure, the speed,
      the acceleration of each of the plurality of inputted annotations (figures 15-16,
      and page 5 pars. 0072 and 0075). \\nAs to claim 7, Giroti teaches that the further
      step of pairing the one ormore of the plurality of computers on a common device
      with one or more of the mediaconferencing terminals (see summary, figure 1,
      and page 3 pars. 0055-0056).\\n\\nAs to claim 8, it is also rejected for the
      same reasons set forth to rejecting claim 1 above, since claims 8 is merely
      an apparatus for the method of operations defined in the method claim 1, and
      claim 8 does not define or teach any new limitation than claim 1. Additionally,
      Giroti discloses a transaction system comprising: a plurality of computers each
      including an input means, a display means, a network connection and a media
      recording means; a plurality of media conferencing terminals each including
      an input means and an output means; and a transaction utility linked to each
      of the plurality of computers or loaded on the plurality of computers (see summary,
      figure 1, and page 3 pars. 0055-0056).\\n\\nAs to claims 9-10, Giroti discloses
      that the input means of the computer is a stylus and operable to generate a
      pressure, a speed, and an acceleration corresponding to its use (figures 15-16,
      and page 5 pars. 0072 and 0075).\\nAs to claims 11-12, Giroti discloses that
      the display means is a monitor and avideo projector (figure 16, and page 5 par.0075).\\n\\nAs
      to claims 13-14, Giroti discloses that the input means of the media conferencing
      terminal is a camera and the output means is a plurality of audio speakers (figures

      that the output means further comprises a video monitor and a video projector
      (figure 28, and page 9 pars. 0112-0113). \\n\\nAs to claims 17-21, they are
      also rejected for the same reasons set forth to rejecting claims 1-7 above,
      since claims 17-21 are merely an apparatus for the method of operations defined
      in the method claims 1-7, and claims 17-21 do not define or teach any new limitation
      than claims 1-7.\\n\\nResponse to Arguments\\nApplicant\u2019s arguments have

      \\nDETAILED ACTION\\nResponse to Arguments\\nApplicant's arguments filed 5/19/2015
      have been fully considered.  Regarding the rejection of claim 16 under 35 USC
      102 in view of Scholz and separately in view of Kulinyak, Applicant amends the
      claim to include the new limitation of a generator having a housing separate
      from and not constituting a part of the nacelle frame. This argument is persuasive.
      \ Therefore, the rejection has been withdrawn.  However, upon further consideration,
      a new ground(s) of rejection is made in view of Scholz and Fischer and separately
      in view of Kulinyak and Fischer.\\nRegarding the rejection under Scholz, Applicant
      submits that the rotor bearing is not directly supported by a tubular part located
      at the end of the nacelle frame.  Scholz's Fig. 3 clearly shows that the bearings
      11 and 12 \\\"being directly supported by a tubular part located at the end
      of the nacelle frame.\\\"  Any additional support that the bearings receive
      from any other component does not preclude the direct support the bearings receive
      from the tubular part of the nacelle frame.\\nApplicant further submits that
      they are unable to find any disclosure of all the claimed elements.  Applicant
      is directed to the rejection to find the correspondence between the elements
      claimed and the elements in Scholz.\\nRegarding the rejection under Kulinyak,
      Applicants submit that flange is not part of the gearbox housing since it must
      be connected by bolts which would cause  significant structural stresses and
      that the rotor bearing is not directly supported by a tubular portion located
      at the end of the nacelle frame.  Given these new limitations that further necessitate
      a change of rejection the Office further clarifies the correspondence between
      the claimed limitations and the prior art elements.\\nNew claim 31 recites \u201Cthe
      separate connection part surrounds the gearbox\u201D.  Merriam-webster.com provides
      several definitions of \\\"surround\\\". The two most applicable definitions
      to the present application are: to enclose on all sides or to extend around
      the margin or edge of. Since Applicant\u2019s connection part does not enclose
      on all sides the latter definition is used.  By using this definition Scholz
      connection part 13 clearly meets this definition by extending around the margin
      or edge of the gearbox.\\nClaim Objections\\nThe claims are objected to because
      the lines are crowded too closely together, making reading difficult.  Substitute
      claims with lines one and one-half or double spaced on good quality paper are
      required.  See 37 CFR 1.52(b).\\nThe claims 16, 31 and 32 are objected to for
      repeated use of the word \u201Cfarthest\u201D.  Proper English restricts further
      and furthest to descriptions of figurative or abstract distances while farther
      and farthest are to be used when referring to physical distance. \\nClaim Rejections

      of Fischer US 7944077.\\n Regarding claim 16, Scholz discloses in Fig. 3, a
      wind turbine nacelle for mounting on a tower (10) of a wind turbine, the wind
      turbine nacelle comprising: a nacelle frame (3) and a drive train comprising
      a gearbox (39), a rotor comprising a rotor hub (2) with one or more blades (1)
      which are both supported by at least one rotor bearing (11,12), the at least
      one rotor bearing (11,12) being directly supported by a tubular part located
      at an end of the nacelle frame (3) located farthest away from the tower (10)
      and adjacent a nacelle frame flange (Fig. 3) when the tubular part is mounted
      on the tower, wherein the gearbox (39) comprises a gearbox housing (38) which
      is separate from and does not constitute part of the nacelle frame (3), the
      gearbox housing (38) is rigidly and axially connected to the nacelle frame flange
      of the nacelle frame (3) by a gearbox flange (at 37) such that a side of the
      gearbox flange (at 37), located farthest away from an input side of the gearbox
      (39), as seen in a direction along a reference axis from an input to an output
      of the gearbox, is connected to an end of the nacelle frame flange (Fig. 3)
      farthest away from the tower (10) of the wind turbine, a generator (7 and 8),
      without a housing, located within the nacelle frame (3), and the input is an
      input shaft (Fig. 3) of the gearbox (39) which is connected to the rotor hub
      (2), via a separate connection part (13), for supplying rotational drive from
      the rotor hub (2) to the input shaft of the gearbox (39).\\n    PNG    media_image1.png

      that the generator has a housing separate from and not constituting part of
      the nacelle frame.  \\nFischer teaches a wind turbine comprising a nacelle (3)
      having a nacelle frame (10)  comprising upper and lower parts (10a,10b) and
      a generator's stator and rotor (30a and 30b) inside a generator housing (20)
      located inside the nacelle frame which is separate from and not constituting
      part of the nacelle frame (col. 4 ln. 44-57).  Since  both Scholz and Fischer
      teach known methods of housing a generator in a wind turbine nacelle, it would
      have been obvious to one having ordinary skill in the art to substitute one
      type of construction for the other to achieve the predictable result of housing
      a generator in a generator housing located in a nacelle frame in order to generate
      electricity.\\nRegarding claim 21, the combination of Scholz and Fischer teach
      the limitations of claim 16 above and further teaches that the gearbox (Scholz,
      39) is a dual stage planetary gearbox comprising a first planetary gear stage
      and a second planetary gear stage (Scholz, Fig. 3).\\nRegarding claim 23, the
      combination of Scholz and Fischer teach the limitations of claim 21 above and
      further teaches that the first and second planetary gear stages of the gearbox
      are located outside the nacelle frame (Scholz, Fig. 3).\\nRegarding claim 26,

      the combination of Scholz and Fischer teach the limitations of claim 16 above
      and further discloses that a weight of the generator (Scholz, rotor portion
      8) is supported by connection parts (Scholz, 13) which connect the generator
      (Scholz, rotor portion 8) to the nacelle frame (Scholz, 3).\\nRegarding claim
      28, the combination of Scholz and Fischer teach the limitations of claim 16
      above and further discloses that a rotor (Scholz, 8) of the generator is connected
      to an output shaft (Scholz, 19) of the gearbox (Scholz, 39).\\n Regarding claim
      31, Scholz discloses in Fig. 3, a wind turbine nacelle for mounting on a tower

      one rotor bearing (11,12) being supported by a tubular part at a location between
      a nacelle frame flange (Fig. 3) and tower (10), when the tubular part is mounted
      on the tower, wherein the gearbox (39) comprises a gearbox housing (38) which
      is separate from and does not constitute part of the nacelle frame (3), the
      gearbox housing (38) is rigidly and axially connected to the nacelle frame flange
      of the nacelle frame (3) by a gearbox flange (at 37) such that a side of the
      gearbox flange (at 37), located farthest away from an input side of the gearbox
      (39), as seen in a direction along a reference axis from an input to an output
      of the gearbox, is connected to an end of the nacelle frame flange (Fig. 3)
      farthest away from the tower (10) of the wind turbine, a generator (7 and 8)
      is accommodated with in the nacelle frame (3), without a generator housing,
      and an input shaft (Fig. 3) of the gearbox (39) which is connected to the rotor
      hub (2), via a separate connection part (13), for supplying rotational drive
      from the rotor hub (2) to the input shaft of the gearbox (39), and the separate
      connection part (13) surrounds the gearbox (39, see not in response to arguments
      above).\\nHowever, Scholz does not teach that the generator has a housing separate
      from and not constituting part of the nacelle frame.  \\n Fischer teaches a
      wind turbine comprising a nacelle (3) having a nacelle frame (10)  comprising
      upper and lower parts (10a,10b) and a generator's stator and rotor (30a and
      30b) inside a generator housing (20) located inside the nacelle frame which
      is separate from and not constituting part of the nacelle frame (col. 4 ln.

      in a wind turbine nacelle, it would have been obvious to one having ordinary
      skill in the art to substitute one type of construction for the other to achieve
      the predictable result of housing a generator in a generator housing located
      in a nacelle frame in order to generate electricity.\\nRegarding claim 32, Scholz

      a wind turbine, the wind turbine nacelle comprising: a nacelle frame (3) and
      a drive train comprising a gearbox (39), a rotor comprising a rotor hub (2)

      frame flange (Fig. 3) and tower (10), when the tubular part is mounted on the
      tower, wherein the gearbox (39) comprises a gearbox housing (38) which is separate
      from and does not constitute part of the nacelle frame (3), the gearbox housing
      (38) is rigidly and axially connected to the nacelle frame flange of the nacelle
      frame (3) by a gearbox flange (at 37) such that a side of the gearbox flange
      (at 37), located farthest away from an input side of the gearbox (39), as seen
      in a direction along a reference axis from an input to an output of the gearbox,
      is connected to an end of the nacelle frame flange (Fig. 3)  farthest away from
      the tower (10) of the wind turbine, the gearbox flange (at 37) comprising a
      material more rigid (being a plate vs a cylinder) than a material of the nacelle
      frame flange (Fig. 3, being a cylinder) such that the engagement of the gearbox
      flange (at 37) with the nacelle frame flange (Fig. 3) stiffens an open end of
      the tubular portion (Fig. 3) so that the nacelle frame (3) resists deformation
      due to rotor loads, a generator (7 and 8) is accommodated with in the nacelle
      frame (3), without a generator housing, and an input shaft (Fig. 3) of the gearbox
      (39) which is connected to the rotor hub (2), via a separate connection part

      of the gearbox (39), and the separate connection part (13) surrounds the gearbox
      (39, see not in response to arguments above).\\nHowever, Scholz does not teach
      that the generator has a housing separate from and not constituting part of
      the nacelle frame.  \\nFischer teaches a wind turbine comprising a nacelle (3)

      Fischer teach the limitations of claim 16 above.  However it does not teach
      that the connection between the rotor hub and the gearbox is flexible.  \\nQuintal

      a flexible connection (Fig. 8B) between two connected rotor shafts (13,13\u2019)

      generated by each rotor.  Thus, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary
      skill in the art, at the time of invention, to modify the bolts in the rotor
      hub and gearbox, as taught by the number='12'combination of Kulinyak and Fischer,

      connection (Quintal, Fig. 8B).\\nRegarding claim 19, Kulinyak and Quintal teach
      the limitations of claim 17 above and further teach that the separate connection
      part (Kulinyak, 31) is connected to the rotor hub (Kulinyak, 4) and the input
      shaft of the gearbox (Kulinyak, 7) by bolts (Kulinyak, Fig. 1), and the bolts

      gearbox comprising a first planetary gear stage.\\nNumajiri teaches a wind turbine
      (Fig. 21) with a gearbox being a single stage planetary gearbox (30A) comprising
      a first planetary gear stage (32A) for increasing the speed of the output shaft
      to the generator ([0138]).  Thus, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary
      skill in the art, at the time of invention, to modify the gearbox, as taught
      by combination of Kulinyak and Fischer, by substituting the single stage planetary
      number='13'gearbox, as taught by Numajiri, since the simple substitution of
      one known element for another would have yielded the predictable result of increasing
      the speed of the output shaft to the generator. \\nRegarding claim 22, the combination
      of Kulinyak, Fischer and Numajiri teach the limitations of claim 20 above and

      Kulinyak and Fischer teach the limitations of claim 16 above.  However, it does
      not teach that the wind turbine nacelle further comprises a crane on the nacelle
      frame.  \\nDe Buhr teaches a wind turbine having a crane (28) installed in the
      nacelle (12) in order to insert and exchange drive train components ([0030]).
      \ Thus, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art, at the
      time of invention, to modify nacelle, as taught by the combination of Kulinyak
      and Fischer, by including a crane in the nacelle, as taught by de Buhr, in order
      to facilitate the insertion and exchange of drive train components. \\n\\nnumber='14'Claim

      platform (16) extending away from the tower (14) for construction and maintenance
      of the wind turbine (col. 3 ln. 14-16).  Thus, it would have been obvious to
      one of ordinary skill in the art, at the time of invention, to modify the tower,

      of Chiba et al (U.S. Patent No. 7,294,998).\\nIn re claim 1, Diorio \u2018550
      discloses in figure 7A a chip testing apparatus (system 66) for testing a radio
      frequency identification (RFID) chip (RFID IC 70), comprising:\\n a command
      generating module (calibration module 72), for generating a first test command;
      \\na transceiving module (TX/RX 73), for \\ntransmitting the first test command
      to the RFID chip (RFID IC 70), and\\nreceiving a target test result from the
      RFID chip (as explained in column 5, lines 40-44) in response to transmission
      and processing of the first test command by the RFIC chip (col. 5, lines 40-44,
      52-54); and \\na control module (RFID IC test device 68), for \\ncontrolling
      the command generating module (calibration module 72) to generate the first
      test command (value generated as explained in col. 5, lines 51-54);\\ndetermining
      whether the target test result complies with a reference test result (if update
      value is needed, as explained in column 5, lines 54-59), and \\ncontrolling
      the command generating module to generate a second test command for retesting
      the RFID chip (by updating the calibration value when deemed necessary, as explained
      in column 5, lines 54-59).\\n    PNG    media_image1.png    168    435    media_image1.png
      \   Greyscale\\n Diorio \u2018550 further suggest providing a reference value
      necessary for determining if update values for calibration are needed (as explained
      in the functionality of the embodiment of figure 7A, see col. 5, lines 21-28,
      51-59) but does not particularly teach a reference test result providing unit,
      for providing a reference test result.\\nHowever, Chiba \u2018998 does teach
      in figure 10 a well-known testing arrangement providing a reference test result
      providing unit (generation unit 2) for providing a reference test result (expected
      value data being input to logical comparison unit 4).\\n    PNG    media_image2.png
      \   234    523    media_image2.png    Greyscale\\nTherefore, it would have been
      obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention
      was made to have provided the testing apparatus as taught by Diorio et al with
      an actual, separate circuit element for providing a reference test result in
      order to test a semiconductor chip by comparing a sensed signal from the device
      under test with a known expected value or signal, as suggested by Chiba et al
      (see col. 6, lines 26-30).\\n Regarding claim 2, Diorio \u2018550 discloses
      wherein the second test command is different from the first test command (since
      the update value can be incremented or decremented as explained in column 5,
      lines 46-54). \\nWith respect to claim 3, Diorio \u2018550 discloses in figure
      7A wherein the RFID chip (RFID IC 70) is coupled to the transceiving module
      (TX/RX 73) whereby receiving the first test command or transmit the target test
      result, but does not specifically teach if is coupled in a wired manner, whereby
      receiving the first test command or transmit the target test result.\\nHowever,
      Diorio \u2018550 does teach communication via a wire link (as explained in column
      6, lines 54-56). \\nTherefore, it would have been obvious to one having ordinary
      skill in the art at the time the invention was made to have coupled the RFID
      chip to the transceiving module as taught by the embodiment of figure 7A of
      Diorio et al in a wired manner since it was known to do so as also evidenced
      by Diorio et al (see column 6, lines 54-56).\\nRegarding claim 5, the combination
      of the particular embodiment of figure 7A of Diorio \u2018550 in view of Chiba
      \u2018998 discloses the reference test providing unit, as explained in the rejection
      of claim 1 above, but does not particularly teach the reference test providing
      unit comprising a simulation module, for generating the reference test result
      by simulating a response of a standard chip to the first test command.\\nHowever,
      Diorio \u2018550 does suggest a simulation module, for generating the reference
      test result by simulating the first test command (any of the embodiments  disclosed
      can be used in a simulation environment as explained in column 17, lines 27-28).\\nIt
      would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the
      time the invention was made to have provided the reference test providing unit
      as taught by the combination of Diorio et al in view of Chiba et al with a simulation
      module since it was well known to implement any of the embodiments taught by
      Diorio et al in a simulation environment, as suggested in Diorio et al.\\nAs
      for claim 6, the combination of Diorio \u2018550 in view of Chiba \u2018998
      teaches the reference test providing unit as claimed, but does not specifically
      disclose a standard comparison chip corresponding to a target chip, for generating
      a comparison test result regarded as the reference test result according to
      the first test command.\\nHowever, given that Chiba \u2018998 specifically teaches
      providing an expected value data, it would have been obvious to one having ordinary
      skill in the art at the time the invention was made to have provided the apparatus
      as taught by Diorio et al in view of Chiba et al with a standard comparison
      chip to obtain said expected value data from a device known to be in good condition
      in order to compared the expected value data with data obtained from the chip
      under test.\\nWith respect to claim 9, Diorio '550 teaches wherein the control
      module (RFID IC test device 68) controlling the command generating module (calibration
      module 72)  to generate the second test command for retesting the RFID chip
      when the target test result fails to comply with the reference test result (as
      explained in column 5, lines 54-59).\\n As for claim 11, Diorio \u2018550 discloses
      a chip testing method for testing an RFID chip (RFID IC 70), comprising steps
      of:\\n(a) generating a first test command (via calibration module 72, as explained
      in column 5, lines 17-21);\\n(b) transmitting (via TX/RX 73) the first test
      command to the RFID chip (RFID IC 70, as explained in column 5, lines 40-42);\\n(c)
      receiving a target test result from the RFID chip (RFID IC 70, as explained
      in column 5, lines 54-59) in response to transmission and processing of the
      first test command by the RFIC chip (col. 5, lines 40-44, 52-54);\\n(d) determining
      whether the target test result complies with a referencetest result (as explained
      in column 5, lines 54-59); and\\n(e) generating a second test command for retesting
      the RFID chip (RDIF IC 70, as explained in column 5, lines 54-59).\\nDiorio
      \u2018550 further suggest providing a reference value necessary for determining
      if update values for calibration are needed (as explained in the functionality
      of the embodiment of figure 7A, see col. 5, lines 21-28, 51-59) but does not
      particularly teach said reference value as a reference test result.\\nHowever,
      Chiba \u2018998 does teach in figure 10 a well-known testing arrangement providing
      a reference test result providing unit (generation unit 2) for providing a reference
      test result (expected value data being input to logical comparison unit 4).\\nTherefore,
      it would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the
      time the invention was made to have provided the method as taught by Diorio
      et  al with a further step for providing and actual reference test result in
      order to test a semiconductor chip by comparing a sensed signal from the device
      under test with a known expected value or signal, as suggested by Chiba et al
      (see col. 6, lines 26-30).\\nIn re claim 12, Diorio \u2018550 discloses wherein
      the second test command is different from the first test command (since the
      update value can be incremented or decremented as explained in column 5, lines
      46-54). \\nIn re claim 14, the combination of the embodiment of figure 7A of
      Diorio \u2018550 in view of Chiba \u2018998 discloses the claimed limitations
      except for specifically teaching generating the first test result by simulating
      the first test command.\\nHowever, Diorio \u2018550 does teach a simulation
      module, for generating the reference test result by simulating the first test
      command (any of the embodiments disclosed can be used in a simulation environment
      as explained in column 17, lines 27-28).\\nIt would have been obvious to a person
      having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to have
      provided the method as taught by the combination of the embodiment of figure
      7A of Diorio et al in view of Chiba et al with generating the reference test
      result by simulating the first test command since it was well known to implement
      any of the embodiments taught by Diorio et al in a simulation environment, as
      suggested in Diorio et al.\\nRegarding claim 15, Diorio \u2018550 teaches a
      comparing function to determine whether an update value is required (as explained
      in column 5, lines 54-59) but does  not specifically teach transmitting a first
      test command to a comparison chip and generating the reference test result according
      to a response of the comparison chip.\\nHowever, given that Chiba \u2018998
      specifically teaches providing an expected value data, it would have been obvious
      to one having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to
      have provided the method as taught by Diorio et al in view of Chiba et al with
      a comparison chip to obtain said expected value data from a device known to
      be in good condition when  tested under the same circumstances as the device
      currently being tested in order to compared the expected value data with data
      obtained from the chip under test.\\nWith respect to claim 18, Diorio \u2018550
      discloses transmitting the first test command to the RFID chip (RFID IC 70)
      via the transceiving module (TX/RX 73) but does not specifically teach said
      transmitting via a wire.\\nHowever, Diorio \u2018550 does teach communication
      via a wire link (as explained in column 6, lines 54-56). \\nTherefore, it would
      have been obvious to one having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention
      was made to have coupled the RFID chip to the transceiving module as taught
      by the embodiment of figure 7A of Diorio et al in a wired manner since it was
      known to do so as also evidenced by Diorio et al (see column 6, lines 54-56).\\nRegarding
      claim 19, Diorio \u2018550 teaches wherein the second test command is generated
      when the target test result fails to comply with the reference test result (as
      explained in column 5, lines 54-59).\\n As for claim 21, Diorio \u2018550 shows
      in figure 7A the test signal is transmitted from the test device (68) to the
      RFID IC (70) which is equivalent to the first test command complying with a
      command defined by an RFID protocol, since if the signal did not comply with
      said protocol, communication between test device (68) and RFID IC (70) would
      not be possible.\\n Claims 7-8 and 16-17 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a)
      as being unpatentable over Diorio et al (U.S. Patent No. 7,120,550) in view
      of Chiba et al (U.S. Patent No. 7,294,998) as applied to claims 1 and 11 above,
      and further in view of Bayer et al (U.S. PGPub No. 2007/0084641).\\nIn re claim
      7, the combination of Diorio '550 in view of Chiba \u2018998 discloses the claimed
      limitation as explained in the rejection of claim 1 above, but does not specifically
      teach a database, storing a plurality of test results, wherein when the first
      test command is generated, the command generating module selects a reference
      test result corresponding to the first test command from the database.\\nHowever,
      Bayer \u2018641 does teach an RFID IC system using a random test sample database
      (paragraph [0031]).\\nIt would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill
      in the art at the time the invention was made to have provided the apparatus
      as taught by Diorio et al in view of Chiba et al with a random test sample database
      in order to store the test signals/values and randomly provide them to the RFID
      IC under test, as suggested by Bayer et al.\\nnumber='10'Regarding claim 8,
      the combination of Diorio '550 and Chiba \u2018998 teaches the claimed limitations
      except for specifically teaching wherein the command generating module randomly
      generates the first test command and the second test command.\\nHowever, Bayer
      \u2018641 does teach an RFID IC system using a random test sample database (paragraph
      [0031]).\\nIt would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art

      IC under test, as suggested by Bayer et al.\\nWith respect to claim 16 the combination
      of Diorio '550 and Chiba \u2018998 discloses the claimed limitations except
      for specifically teaching selecting the reference test result corresponding
      to the first test command from a database.\\nHowever, Bayer \u2018641 does teach

      the test signals/values and randomly provide them to the RFID IC under test,
      as suggested by Bayer et al.\\nAs for claim 17, the combination of Diorio '550
      and Chiba \u2018998 teaches the claimed limitations except for specifically

      ACTION\\nAmended claims 1-9 and 11-19 and newly added claim 21 of U.S. Application
      No. 12/547,555 filed on 02/29/2012 are presented for examination.\\n\\nClaim
      Objections\\nClaims 1-10 are objected to because of the following informalities:
      \ in claim 1, line 14, \u201Ca reference test\u201D should be replaced with
      \\\"the reference test\u201D to comply with antecedent basis, since it refers
      back to the reference test result previously provided by the reference test
      result providing unit and no to a new and different reference test result.  Claims
      2-10 are also objected for depending on claim 1.\\nAppropriate correction is
      required.\\n\\nClaim Rejections - 35 USC \xA7 103\\nThe following is a quotation
      of 35 U.S.C. 103(a) which forms the basis for all obviousness rejections set
      forth in this Office action:\\n(a) A patent may not be obtained though the invention
      is not identically disclosed or described as set forth in section 102 of this
      title, if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and
      the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious
      at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the
      art to which said subject matter pertains.  Patentability shall not be negatived
      by the manner in which the invention was made.\\n\\nClaims 1-3, 5-6, 9, 11-12,
      14-15, 18-19 and 21 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable
      over Diorio et al (U.S. Patent No. 7,120,550) in view of Chiba et al (U.S. Patent
      No. 7,294,998).\\nIn re claim 1, Diorio \u2018550 discloses in figure 7A a chip
      testing apparatus (system 66) for testing a radio frequency identification (RFID)
      chip (RFID IC 70), comprising:\\n a command generating module (calibration module
      72), for generating a first test command; \\na transceiving module (TX/RX 73),
      for \\ntransmitting the first test command to the RFID chip (RFID IC 70), and\\nreceiving
      a target test result from the RFID chip (as explained in column 5, lines 40-44)
      in response to transmission and processing of the first test command by the
      RFIC chip (col. 5, lines 40-44, 52-54); and \\na control module (RFID IC test
      device 68), for \\ncontrolling the command generating module (calibration module
      72) to generate the first test command (value generated as explained in col.
      5, lines 51-54);\\ndetermining whether the target test result complies with
      a reference test result (if update value is needed, as explained in column 5,
      lines 54-59), and \\ncontrolling the command generating module to generate a
      second test command for retesting the RFID chip (by updating the calibration
      value when deemed necessary, as explained in column 5, lines 54-59).\\n    PNG
      \   media_image1.png    168    435    media_image1.png    Greyscale\\n\\n Diorio
      \u2018550 further suggest providing a reference value necessary for determining
      if update values for calibration are needed (as explained in the functionality
      of the embodiment of figure 7A, see col. 5, lines 21-28, 51-59) but does not
      particularly teach a reference test result providing unit, for providing a reference
      test result.\\nHowever, Chiba \u2018998 does teach in figure 10 a well-known
      testing arrangement providing a reference test result providing unit (generation
      unit 2) for providing a reference test result (expected value data being input
      to logical comparison unit 4).\\n    PNG    media_image2.png    234    523    media_image2.png
      \   Greyscale\\nTherefore, it would have been obvious to a person having ordinary
      skill in the art at the time the invention was made to have provided the testing
      apparatus as taught by Diorio et al with an actual, separate circuit element
      for providing a reference test result in order to test a semiconductor chip
      by comparing a sensed signal from the device under test with a known expected
      value or signal, as suggested by Chiba et al (see col. 6, lines 26-30).\\n Regarding
      claim 2, Diorio \u2018550 discloses wherein the second test command is different
      from the first test command (since the update value can be incremented or decremented
      as explained in column 5, lines 46-54). \\nWith respect to claim 3, Diorio \u2018550
      discloses in figure 7A wherein the RFID chip (RFID IC 70) is coupled to the
      transceiving module (TX/RX 73) whereby receiving the first test command or transmit
      the target test result, but does not specifically teach if is coupled in a wired
      manner, whereby receiving the first test command or transmit the target test
      result.\\nHowever, Diorio \u2018550 does teach communication via a wire link
      (as explained in column 6, lines 54-56). \\nTherefore, it would have been obvious
      to one having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to
      have coupled the RFID chip to the transceiving module as taught by the embodiment
      of figure 7A of Diorio et al in a wired manner since it was known to do so as
      also evidenced by Diorio et al (see column 6, lines 54-56).\\nRegarding claim
      5, the combination of the particular embodiment of figure 7A of Diorio \u2018550
      in view of Chiba \u2018998 discloses the reference test providing unit, as explained
      in the rejection of claim 1 above, but does not particularly teach the reference
      test providing unit comprising a simulation module, for generating the reference
      test result by simulating a response of a standard chip to the first test command.\\nHowever,
      Diorio \u2018550 does suggest a simulation module, for generating the reference
      test result by simulating the first test command (any of the embodiments  disclosed
      can be used in a simulation environment as explained in column 17, lines 27-28).\\nIt
      would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the
      time the invention was made to have provided the reference test providing unit
      as taught by the combination of Diorio et al in view of Chiba et al with a simulation
      module since it was well known to implement any of the embodiments taught by
      Diorio et al in a simulation environment, as suggested in Diorio et al.\\nAs
      for claim 6, the combination of Diorio \u2018550 in view of Chiba \u2018998
      teaches the reference test providing unit as claimed, but does not specifically
      disclose a standard comparison chip corresponding to a target chip, for generating
      a comparison test result regarded as the reference test result according to
      the first test command.\\nHowever, given that Chiba \u2018998 specifically teaches
      providing an expected value data, it would have been obvious to one having ordinary
      skill in the art at the time the invention was made to have provided the apparatus
      as taught by Diorio et al in view of Chiba et al with a standard comparison
      chip to obtain said expected value data from a device known to be in good condition
      in order to compared the expected value data with data obtained from the chip
      under test.\\nWith respect to claim 9, Diorio '550 teaches wherein the control
      module (RFID IC test device 68) controlling the command generating module (calibration
      module 72)  to generate the second test command for retesting the RFID chip
      when the target test result fails to comply with the reference test result (as
      explained in column 5, lines 54-59).\\n As for claim 11, Diorio \u2018550 discloses
      a chip testing method for testing an RFID chip (RFID IC 70), comprising steps
      of:\\n(a) generating a first test command (via calibration module 72, as explained
      in column 5, lines 17-21);\\n(b) transmitting (via TX/RX 73) the first test
      command to the RFID chip (RFID IC 70, as explained in column 5, lines 40-42);\\n(c)
      receiving a target test result from the RFID chip (RFID IC 70, as explained
      in column 5, lines 54-59) in response to transmission and processing of the
      first test command by the RFIC chip (col. 5, lines 40-44, 52-54);\\n(d) determining
      whether the target test result complies with a referencetest result (as explained
      in column 5, lines 54-59); and\\n(e) generating a second test command for retesting
      the RFID chip (RDIF IC 70, as explained in column 5, lines 54-59).\\nDiorio
      \u2018550 further suggest providing a reference value necessary for determining
      if update values for calibration are needed (as explained in the functionality
      of the embodiment of figure 7A, see col. 5, lines 21-28, 51-59) but does not
      particularly teach said reference value as a reference test result.\\nHowever,
      Chiba \u2018998 does teach in figure 10 a well-known testing arrangement providing
      a reference test result providing unit (generation unit 2) for providing a reference
      test result (expected value data being input to logical comparison unit 4).\\nTherefore,
      it would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the
      time the invention was made to have provided the method as taught by Diorio
      et  al with a further step for providing and actual reference test result in
      order to test a semiconductor chip by comparing a sensed signal from the device
      under test with a known expected value or signal, as suggested by Chiba et al
      (see col. 6, lines 26-30).\\nIn re claim 12, Diorio \u2018550 discloses wherein
      the second test command is different from the first test command (since the
      update value can be incremented or decremented as explained in column 5, lines
      46-54). \\nIn re claim 14, the combination of the embodiment of figure 7A of
      Diorio \u2018550 in view of Chiba \u2018998 discloses the claimed limitations
      except for specifically teaching generating the first test result by simulating
      the first test command.\\nHowever, Diorio \u2018550 does teach a simulation
      module, for generating the reference test result by simulating the first test
      command (any of the embodiments disclosed can be used in a simulation environment
      as explained in column 17, lines 27-28).\\nIt would have been obvious to a person
      having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to have
      provided the method as taught by the combination of the embodiment of figure
      7A of Diorio et al in view of Chiba et al with generating the reference test
      result by simulating the first test command since it was well known to implement
      any of the embodiments taught by Diorio et al in a simulation environment, as
      suggested in Diorio et al.\\nRegarding claim 15, Diorio \u2018550 teaches a
      comparing function to determine whether an update value is required (as explained
      in column 5, lines 54-59) but does  not specifically teach transmitting a first
      test command to a comparison chip and generating the reference test result according
      to a response of the comparison chip.\\nHowever, given that Chiba \u2018998
      specifically teaches providing an expected value data, it would have been obvious
      to one having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to
      have provided the method as taught by Diorio et al in view of Chiba et al with
      a comparison chip to obtain said expected value data from a device known to
      be in good condition when  tested under the same circumstances as the device
      currently being tested in order to compared the expected value data with data
      obtained from the chip under test.\\nWith respect to claim 18, Diorio \u2018550
      discloses transmitting the first test command to the RFID chip (RFID IC 70)
      via the transceiving module (TX/RX 73) but does not specifically teach said
      transmitting via a wire.\\nHowever, Diorio \u2018550 does teach communication
      via a wire link (as explained in column 6, lines 54-56). \\nTherefore, it would
      have been obvious to one having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention
      was made to have coupled the RFID chip to the transceiving module as taught
      by the embodiment of figure 7A of Diorio et al in a wired manner since it was
      known to do so as also evidenced by Diorio et al (see column 6, lines 54-56).\\nRegarding
      claim 19, Diorio \u2018550 teaches wherein the second test command is generated
      when the target test result fails to comply with the reference test result (as
      explained in column 5, lines 54-59).\\n As for claim 21, Diorio \u2018550 shows
      in figure 7A the test signal is transmitted from the test device (68) to the
      RFID IC (70) which is equivalent to the first test command complying with a
      command defined by an RFID protocol, since if the signal did not comply with
      said protocol, communication between test device (68) and RFID IC (70) would
      not be possible.\\nClaims 7-8 and 16-17 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a)
      as being unpatentable over Diorio et al (U.S. Patent No. 7,120,550) in view
      of Chiba et al (U.S. Patent No. 7,294,998) as applied to claims 1 and 11 above,
      and further in view of Bayer et al (U.S. PGPub No. 2007/0084641).\\nIn re claim
      7, the combination of Diorio '550 in view of Chiba \u2018998 discloses the claimed
      limitation as explained in the rejection of claim 1 above, but does not specifically
      teach a database, storing a plurality of test results, wherein when the first
      test command is generated, the command generating module selects a reference
      test result corresponding to the first test command from the database.\\nHowever,
      Bayer \u2018641 does teach an RFID IC system using a random test sample database
      (paragraph [0031]).\\nIt would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill
      in the art at the time the invention was made to have provided the apparatus
      as taught by Diorio et al in view of Chiba et al with a random test sample database
      in order to store the test signals/values and randomly provide them to the RFID
      IC under test, as suggested by Bayer et al.\\nnumber='10'Regarding claim 8,
      the combination of Diorio '550 and Chiba \u2018998 teaches the claimed limitations
      except for specifically teaching wherein the command generating module randomly
      generates the first test command and the second test command.\\nHowever, Bayer
      \u2018641 does teach an RFID IC system using a random test sample database (paragraph
      [0031]).\\nIt would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art
      at the time the invention was made to have provided the apparatus as taught
      by Diorio et al in view of Chiba et al with a random test sample database in
      order to store the test signals/values and randomly provide them to the RFID
      IC under test, as suggested by Bayer et al.\\nWith respect to claim 16 the combination
      of Diorio '550 and Chiba \u2018998 discloses the claimed limitations except
      for specifically teaching selecting the reference test result corresponding
      to the first test command from a database.\\nHowever, Bayer \u2018641 does teach
      an RFID IC system using a random test sample database (paragraph [0031]).\\nIt
      would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time
      the invention was made to have provided the method as taught by Diorio et al
      in view of Zasio et al with a random test sample database in order to store
      the test signals/values and randomly provide them to the RFID IC under test,
      as suggested by Bayer et al.\\nAs for claim 17, the combination of Diorio '550
      and Chiba \u2018998 teaches the claimed limitations except for specifically
      teaching wherein the first test command and the second test command are randomly
      generated.\\nnumber='11'However, Bayer \u2018641 does teach an RFID IC system
      using a random test sample database (paragraph [0031]).\\nIt would have been
      obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was
      made to have provided the method as taught by Diorio et al in view of Chiba
      et al with a random test sample database in order to store the test signals/values
      and randomly provide them to the RFID IC under test, as suggested by Bayer et
      al.\\n\\nClaims 4 and 13 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable
      over Diorio et al (U.S. Patent No. 7,120,550) in view of Chiba et al (U.S. Patent
      No. 7,294,998) as applied to claims 1 and 11 above, and further in view of Kumar
      et al (U.S. PGPub No. 2006/0047545).\\nIn re claim 4, the combination of Diorio
      '550 and Chiba \u2018998 discloses the claimed limitations except for specifically
      teaching a converting unit, for converting a signal format of the first test
      command to a target signal format complying with the RFID chip.\\nHowever, Kumar
      \u2018545 does teach converting data into suitable/compatible format for the
      target destination RFID (see paragraph [0033]).\\nTherefore, it would have been
      obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention
      was made to have provided the apparatus as taught by Diorio et al in view of
      Chiba et al with a converting unit for converting a signal format to a target
      signal complying with the RFIC chip if necessary, since data formatting according
      to target RFID if necessary is a widely used technique in RFIC technology as
      evidenced by Kumar et al.\\nnumber='12'Regarding claim 14, the combination of
      Diorio '550 and Chiba \u2018998 discloses the claimed limitations except for
      specifically teaching converting a signal format of the first test command to
      a target signal format complying with the RFID chip.\\nHowever, Kumar \u2018545
      does teach converting data into suitable/compatible format for the target destination
      RFID (see paragraph [0033]).\\nTherefore, it would have been obvious to a person
      having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to have
      provided the method as taught by Diorio et al in view of Chiba et al with converting
      a signal format to a target signal complying with the RFIC chip if necessary,
      since data formatting according to target RFID if necessary is a widely used
      technique in RFIC technology as evidenced by Kumar et al.\\n\\nResponse to Arguments\\nApplicant\u2019s
      arguments with respect to claims 1 and 11 regarding Zasio et al have been considered
      but are moot because the arguments do not apply the references being used in
      the current rejection.\\n\\nApplicant's arguments filed 02/29/2012 have been
      fully considered but they are not persuasive.\\nRegarding claims 1 and 11, Applicant
      argues in page 10, lines 21-25 that the claims require the control module to
      be in the testing apparatus, not in the RFID integrated circuit, which is was
      Diorio et al teaches in figure 7B.\\nnumber='13'The Examiner respectfully disagrees.
      The Examiner points out that the rejection is based on the embodiment of figure
      7A, where the control module (RFID IC test device 68) including the command
      generating module (calibration module 72) is clearly shown as a separate element,
      not residing in the RFID integrated circuit as argue. What figure 7B teaches
      is, therefore, irrelevant for the rejection at hand. The Examiner further clarifies
      that calibration requires testing in order to determine if a device complies
      with a desired value or further updates are needed.\\nRegarding claim 2, Applicant
      argues in page 12, lines 5-8 that Diorio et al does not teach the second test
      command different from the first test command since the update value is generated
      only once.\\nThe Examiner respectfully disagrees. Applicant is kindly directed
      to column 5, lines 53-54 where Diorio et al teaches one or more update values,
      which means that calibration values or test signals are generated more than
      once, until the RFID IC complies with the required value. Consequently, Diorio
      et al does teach the second test command different from the first test command,
      since the calibration values are incremented or decremented multiple times as
      necessary (col. 5, lines 47-49, 53-54).\\nAs for claim 5, Applicant argues in
      page 12, lines 19-25 that Diorio et al fails to teach the simulation module
      as a physical circuit, which is clearly what claim 5 refers to.\\nThe Examiner
      respectfully disagrees. Contrary to Applicant's arguments, claim 5 does not
      positively require the simulation module to be a physical circuit alone. In
      fact, simulation is well known to be performed with software aid. Furthermore,
      software by number='14'itself is nothing without a physical circuit (e.g. computer,
      microchip) to run it, which constitutes an actual physical circuit.\\nRegarding
      claim 6, Applicant argues in page 13, lines 14-18 that Diorio et al fails to
      disclose the reference relationship or the substitute relationship of the standard
      chip as claimed.\\nThe Examiner respectfully disagrees. The claim language as
      it currently stand is mute as to requiring the comparison chip to be a substitute
      chip, but only to provide a value to be used as the reference value. Applicant
      is kindly reminded that although claims are interpreted in light of the specification,
      limitations from the specification are not read into the claims.  See In re
      Van Geuns, 988 F.2d 1181, 26 USPQ2d 1057 (Fed. Cir. 1993).\\nRegarding claim
      21, Applicant argues in page 14, lines 7-8 that the test signal of Diorio et
      al does not comply with a command defined by an RFID protocol.\\nThe Examiner
      respectfully disagrees. As explained in the rejection of claim 21 above, Diorio
      et al shows in figure 7 the test signal is transmitted from the test device
      to the RFID IC. Therefore, the signal is defined by an RFID protocol since signal
      transmission would not be possible otherwise.\\nApplicant argues in page 14,
      that claims 3, 9, 12, 14-15, 18-19 are allowable for at least the same reasons
      as claims 1 and 11 stated above.\\nThe Examiner respectfully disagrees for the
      reasons stated above. The Examiner further points out that arguments against
      Zasio et al are mute in view of the new rejection.\\nnumber='15'Applicant argues
      in page 15 that claims 4 and 13 are allowable for at least the same reasons
      as claims 1 and 11 stated above.\\nThe Examiner respectfully disagrees for the
      reasons stated above. The Examiner further points out that arguments against
      Zasio et al are mute in view of the new rejection.\\nApplicant argues in page
      16 that claims 7-8 and 16-17 are allowable for at least the same reasons as
      claims 1 and 11 stated above.\\nThe Examiner respectfully disagrees for the
      reasons stated above. The Examiner further points out that arguments against
      Zasio et al are mute in view of the new rejection.\\n\\nConclusion\\nThe prior
      art made of record and not relied upon is considered pertinent to applicant's
      disclosure.\\nKoh et al (U.S. Patent No. 7,997,807) discloses a built-in test
      circuit for testing an analog circuit that generates a reference selection signal
      for selecting a voltage of the reference signal, and that generates a test output
      signal in response to a pass signal generated based on an output signal of the
      comparator circuit.\\nKhandros et al (U.S. Patent No. 7,253,651) discloses a
      remote test facility wherein a test generator generates test data by reference
      to a data table stored in memory storage.\\nnumber='16'Itoh et al (U.S. PGPub
      No. 2004/0160237) discloses an assembly for supplying an LSI test signal from
      an LSI tester to a target device under test and a test result signal generated
      by processing of the target device performed in accordance with the test signal.\\n\\nApplicant's

      arguments filed 3/1/2021 regarding Baker and Henderson have been fully considered
      but they are not persuasive.\\nRegarding claim 1, Henderson discloses a curved
      support member configured to follow a contour of an inferior tarsus of a patient.
      \   The device is fully capable of use above or below the eye.\\nRegarding claim
      1, Baker meets the broadest reasonable interpretation of a curved support member
      configured to follow a contour of an inferior tarsus of a patient because a
      rounded knob is curved.\\nRegarding claim 8 and 57, Baker meets the newly added
      limitations of adjustable distance and fixed distance after implantation because
      Baker discloses at column 6 lines 66 \u2013 column 7 line 23 that the apparatus
      distance may be fixed by setting a control switch to off.\\n\\nClaim Rejections

      discloses a bainitic steel alloy composition comprising alloying constituents
      with wt% ranges that overlap. As the claimed ranges overlap or lie inside ranges
      disclosed by the prior art, a prima facie case of obviousness is established
      as it would have been obvious to one skilled in the art to select  the claimed
      composition over the prior art disclosure since the prior art teaches the same
      utility/properties (strip, sheet, pipe, parts for automobile or industrial construction)
      over the disclosed range. See MPEP 2144.05 (I )which states in the case where
      the claimed ranges \u201Coverlap or lie inside ranges disclosed by the prior

      (Fed. Cir. 1990). \\nMore specifically, steel 22 meets claims 2 and 3 for the
      reasons applied to claim 1 discussed above but includes 0.14% C which is outside
      015-0.60% C (claim 2) and 0.18-0.50% C (claim 3). Nonetheless, absent anything
      unexpected, it would be obvious for one skilled in the art to modify steel 22
      by increasing C content to at least 0.18% since its broader alloy disclosure
      teaches 0.05-0.3% C as acceptable. See Nobuhiro, para.[0034].\\nRegarding claim
      4, Steel 22 closely meets claim 2 and also contains Mo, Ni, W, Nb and Ti in
      amounts that meet those presently claimed as shown in table above.\\nRegarding
      claim 5, Nobuhiro (para.[0010]) teaches a microstructure comprising 34-97% bainite
      and/or bainitic ferrite and 3-30% austenite which suggest presently claimed
      microstructure comprising at least 75% bainite, at least 10% austenite and 0-5%
      martensite. \\nRegarding claim 6, Nobuhiro does not expressly teach the steel
      alloy meeting presently claimed conditions for transformation kinetic martensite
      start temperature and microstructure formation. The presently claimed conditions,
      however, are directed to process of making the steel alloy by controlling alloying
      constituents with a corresponding cooling rate, which would not be a patentable
      consideration in a product-by-process claim 1. According to MPEP 2113(R-1),
      if the product in the product-by-process claim is the same as or obvious from
      a product of the prior art, the claim is unpatentable even though  the prior

      summarized as follows:\\n1. Determining the scope and contents of the prior

      at issue.\\n3. Resolving the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art.\\n4.

      patentability of the claims under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a), the examiner presumes
      that the subject matter of the various claims was commonly owned at the time
      any inventions covered therein were made absent any evidence to the contrary.
      \ Applicant is advised of the obligation under 37 CFR 1.56 to point out the
      inventor and invention dates of each claim that was not commonly owned at the
      time a later invention was made in order for the examiner to consider the applicability
      of pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(c) and potential pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 102(e), (f) or
      (g) prior art under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a).\\nClaims 2 to 6 are rejected
      under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Nobuhiro.\\nRegarding
      claims 2 & 3, Nobuhiro (English abstract, paras.[0010]-[0014]) discloses a bainitic
      steel alloy composition comprising alloying constituents with wt% ranges that
      overlap. As the claimed ranges overlap or lie inside ranges disclosed by the
      prior art, a prima facie case of obviousness is established as it would have
      been obvious to one skilled in the art to select  the claimed composition over
      the prior art disclosure since the prior art teaches the same utility/properties
      (strip, sheet, pipe, parts for automobile or industrial construction) over the
      disclosed range. See MPEP 2144.05 (I )which states in the case where the claimed
      ranges \u201Coverlap or lie inside ranges disclosed by the prior art\u201D a
      prima facie case of obviousness exists. In re Wertheim, 541 F.2d 257, 191 USPQ
      90 (CCPA 1976); In re Woodruff, 919 F.2d 1575, 16 USPQ2d 1934 (Fed. Cir. 1990).
      \\nMore specifically, steel 22 meets claims 2 and 3 for the reasons applied
      to claim 1 discussed above but includes 0.14% C which is outside 015-0.60% C
      (claim 2) and 0.18-0.50% C (claim 3). Nonetheless, absent anything unexpected,
      it would be obvious for one skilled in the art to modify steel 22 by increasing
      C content to at least 0.18% since its broader alloy disclosure teaches 0.05-0.3%
      C as acceptable. See Nobuhiro, para.[0034].\\nRegarding claim 4, Steel 22 closely
      meets claim 2 and also contains Mo, Ni, W, Nb and Ti in amounts that meet those
      presently claimed as shown in table above.\\nRegarding claim 5, Nobuhiro (para.[0010])
      teaches a microstructure comprising 34-97% bainite and/or bainitic ferrite and
      3-30% austenite which suggest presently claimed microstructure comprising at
      least 75% bainite, at least 10% austenite and 0-5% martensite. \\nRegarding
      claim 6, Nobuhiro does not expressly teach the steel alloy meeting presently
      claimed conditions for transformation kinetic martensite start temperature and
      microstructure formation. The presently claimed conditions, however, are directed
      to process of making the steel alloy by controlling alloying constituents with
      a corresponding cooling rate, which would not be a patentable consideration
      in a product-by-process claim 1. According to MPEP 2113(R-1), if the product
      in the product-by-process claim is the same as or obvious from a product of
      the prior art, the claim is unpatentable even though  the prior art product
      was made by a different process, In re Thrope, 777 F.2d 695, 698, 227 USPQ 964,
      966 (Fed. Cir. 1985). The burden  falls to Applicant to show that any process
      steps associated with the claimed product result in a materially different product
      from those of the prior art because there is nothing in the record before the
      examiner to reasonably conclude that claimed product differs in kind from those
      obtained by the prior art.\\nThus, in light of foregoing reasons, claims 1 to
      10 are not patentable over Nobuhiro.\\nConclusion\\nNo claims allowable.\\n\\n\\nAny

      Pub. No.:  2005/0156476 A1).\\nFor claim 1, Hsu et al. disclose the claimed
      invention comprising: a plurality of rotor bars (reference numeral 16, figure
      1); and a first coupling component (reference numeral 17, figure 2) configured
      to electrically couple the plurality of rotor bars together, wherein each rotor
      bar of the plurality of rotor bars comprises: a first metallic material (see
      column 2, lines 45-54) having a first electrical resistivity, the first metallic
      material having a first end and a second end opposite the first end (see figure
      4), wherein the first coupling component is coupled to the first end of the
      first metallic material (see figures 2, 4).  Hsu et al. do not specifically
      disclose a second metallic material cast about the first material and having
      a second electrical resistivity greater than the first electrical resistivity.
      \ \\nNishihama et al. disclose a rotor conductor (reference numeral 25, see
      figure 7) with a conductor portion (reference numeral 2511), i.e. second metallic
      material, having  a high resistivity being cast on the lower conductor portion
      (reference numeral 2521) having a lower resistivity (see paragraph [0053], and
      figure 7).  \\nIt would have been obvious to include the conductor configuration
      as taught by Nishihama et al. for the rotor bars of Hsu et al., since the invention
      of Nishihama et al. is related to providing high efficiency for the electrical
      machine (see paragraph [0007]), which is the same goal as that of the applicants\u2019
      invention.  \\nFor claim 2, Hsu et al. in view of Nishihama et al. disclose
      the claimed invention including the first metallic material comprising a copper
      bar (Hsu et al., see column 2, lines 45-50), but do not specifically disclose
      the second metallic material comprising aluminum.  Using a material such as
      aluminum for a rotor bar is a known skill in the art as exhibited by Hsu et
      al. (see column 2, lines 46, 59-63), of which when applied to the second metallic

      inventions of Hsu et al. in view of Nishihama et al. for the purpose of increasing
      the efficiency of the machine.  \\nFor claim 3, Hsu et al. disclose each rotor
      bar of the plurality of rotor bars (reference numeral 16) having a first end

      \ rotor bars, wherein the second coupling component is configured to electrically
      couple the plurality of rotor bars together (see figures 2, 4).  \\nFor claim
      9, Hsu et al. disclose a plurality of bars (reference numeral 16, figure 1)
      inserted into a rotor bar housing (reference numeral 11, figure 1), wherein
      each bar of the plurality of bars comprises a first metallic material (see column
      2, lines 45-54) having a first electrical resistivity; and a coupling component

      about the plurality of bars inserted into the rotor bar housing, wherein the
      second metallic material has a second electrical resistivity greater than the
      first electrical resistivity.  \\nNishihama et al. disclose a rotor conductor

      2511), i.e. second metallic material, having a high resistivity being cast on
      the lower conductor portion (reference numeral 2521) having a lower resistivity
      (see paragraph [0053], and figure 7), which constitutes casting a second metallic
      material about the plurality of bars inserted into the rotor bar housing when
      combined with the invention of Hsu et al., wherein the second metallic material
      has a second electrical resistivity greater than the first electrical resistivity.
      \ \\nIt would have been obvious to include the casting of the second metallic
      material with the resistivity as disclosed by Nishihama et al. in the invention
      of Hsu et al., since the invention of Nishihama et al. is related to providing
      high efficiency for the electrical machine (see paragraph [0007]), which is

      Hsu et al. disclose the electrically coupling of the plurality of bars together
      comprising coupling a first coupling component (reference numeral 17) to a first
      end of each bar of the plurality of bars (figure 4); and coupling a second coupling
      component (reference numeral 18) to a second end of each bar of the plurality
      of bars opposite the first end (figures 2, 4).  \\n Claims 16, 19, and 20 are
      rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Hsu et al. (US Patent
      No.: 6088906) in view of Kincaid (US Patent No.: 1524558) and Nishihama et al.
      (US Patent Application Pub. No.:  2005/0156476 A1).\\nFor claim 16, Hsu et al.
      disclose the claimed invention comprising: a plurality of rotor bars (reference
      numeral 16, figure 1); a first electrical coupling ring (reference numeral 17,
      figure 2) configured to electrically couple each rotor bar of the plurality

      having a first electrical resistivity.  Hsu et al. do not specifically disclose
      a metallic covering surrounding at least a majority of the metallic bar, the
      metallic covering having a second electrical resistivity greater than the first
      electrical resistivity.  \\nKincaid discloses a metallic bar (reference numeral
      3) with a metallic covering (reference numeral 5) surrounding a majority of
      the metallic bar (see figure 1), and Nishihama et al. disclose a rotor conductor
      (reference numeral 25, see figure 7) with a conductor portion (reference numeral
      2511) having a high resistivity being cast on the lower conductor portion (reference
      numeral 2521) having a lower resistivity (see paragraph [0053], and figure 7),
      and when applying the resistivity of these portions as disclosed by Nishihama
      et al. to the bar and the metallic covering of Kincaid, this would constitute
      the metallic covering having a second electrical resistivity greater than the
      first electrical resistivity.  \\nIt would have been obvious to include the
      covering of Kincaid and the resistivity of Nishihama et al. to the invention
      of Hsu et al., since the invention of Kincaid is concerned with the efficiency
      of the device (see lines 12-16), and also the invention of Nishihama et al.
      is related to providing high efficiency for the electrical machine (see paragraph
      [0007]), which is the same goal as that of the applicants\u2019 invention.  \\nFor
      claim 19, Hsu et al. in view of Kincaid and Nishihama et al. disclose the claimed
      invention including a second electrical coupling ring (Hsu et al., reference
      numeral 18) configured to electrically couple each rotor bar of the plurality
      of rotor bars together (Hsu et al., see figures 2, 4); but do not specifically
      teach an insulating material coupled to the first and second coupling rings
      and to the metallic bar of each rotor bar, wherein the insulating material is
      configured to at least partially isolate the first and second coupling rings
      and the metallic bar of each rotor bar from the metallic covering of each rotor
      bar.  Kincaid disclose end rings being secured by insulating material (see lines
      55-58), which when combined with the metallic bar and covering of Hsu et al.
      in view of Kincaid and Nishihama et al. would constitute the insulating material
      configured to at least partially isolate the first and second coupling rings
      and the metallic bar of each rotor bar from the metallic covering of each rotor
      bar, and it would have been obvious to include the teachings of Kincaid in the
      inventions of Hsu et al. in view of Kincaid and Nishihama et al. since Kincaid
      is concerned with the efficiency of the device (see lines 12-16), which is the
      same as that of the applicants\u2019 invention.  \\nFor claim 20, Hsu et al.
      in view of Kincaid and Nishihama et al. disclose the claimed invention except
      for the metallic covering being casted to the metallic bar, and wherein the
      metallic covering comprises aluminum.  Kincaid further discloses the metallic
      covering casted to the metallic bar (figure 1), and using a material such as
      aluminum for a rotor bar is a known skill in the art as exhibited by Hsu et
      al. (see column 2, lines 46, 59-63), of which when applied to the metallic covering
      of Kincaid would constitute the metallic covering comprising aluminum, and it
      would have been obvious to include this configuration in the inventions of Hsu
      et al. in view of Kincaid and Nishihama et al. for the purpose of increasing
      the efficiency of the machine.  \\n Claim 4 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a)
      as being unpatentable over Hsu et al. in view of Nishihama et al. as applied
      to claim 3 above, and further in view of Avakian et al. (US Patent No.: 5793145).\\nFor
      claim 4, Hsu et al. in view of Nishihama et al. disclose the claimed invention
      except for a first cap screwed to a first end of the first metallic material;
      and a second cap screwed to a second end of the first metallic material opposite
      the first end of the first metallic material.  Avakian et al. disclose end caps
      (reference numeral 196) being disposed at first and second ends of the rotor
      (reference numeral 124, see figure 5), and it would have been obvious to include
      the cap configuration for the ends of the metallic material of Hsu et al. in
      view of Nishihama et al. since the invention of Avakian et al. is related to
      improving the sensitivity of the rotor to magnetic fields (see column 2, lines
      45-50), which would contribute to applicant's goal of positively affecting the
      efficiency of the machine.  \\n Claim 10 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a)
      as being unpatentable over Hsu et al. in view of Nishihama et al. as applied
      to claim 9 above, and further in view of Barney (US Patent No.: 2991378).\\nFor
      claim 10, Hsu et al. in view of Nishihama et al. disclose the claimed invention
      except for coupling an electrical insulator to each bar of the plurality of
      bars.  Barney discloses rotor bars (reference numeral 24, figure 2) coupled
      with an insulator (reference numeral 24), and it would have been obvious to
      include this insulator of Barney in the invention of Hsu et al. in view of Nishihama
      et al. since the invention of Barney is concerned with the manufacturing costs
      of the electrical device (see column 1, lines 53-58), the same concerns as those
      of the applicant.  \\n Claims 11 and 12 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a)
      as being unpatentable over Hsu et al. in view of Nishihama et al. as applied
      to claim 9 above, and further in view of Lang et al. (US Patent Application
      Pub. No.:  2009/0079289 A1).\\nFor claim 11, Hsu et al. in view of Nishihama
      et al. disclose the claimed invention except for cladding each bar of the plurality
      of bars with a metallic cladding material.  Lang et al. disclose rotor bars
      (reference numeral 28) with metallic cladding material (reference numeral 29,
      see figures 1-4), and it would have been obvious to include this material of
      Lang et al. in the invention of Hsu et al. in view of Nishihama et al. since
      the invention of Lang et al. is concerned with the efficiency of the rotor (see
      paragraph [0006]), and a person of ordinary skill would have applied this technique
      for the purpose of improving the efficiency of the device.  \\nFor claim 12,
      Hsu et al. in view of Nishihama et al. and Lang et al. disclose the claimed
      invention except for the cladding material comprising aluminum.  Lang et al.
      disclose the cladding material being aluminum (see paragraph [0043]), and it
      would have been obvious to include this material of Lang et al. in the invention
      of Hsu et al. in view of Nishihama et al. and Lang et al. since the invention
      of Lang et al. is concerned with the efficiency of the rotor (see paragraph
      [0006]), and a person of ordinary skill would have applied this technique for
      the purpose of improving the efficiency of the device.  \\n Claim 15 is rejected
      under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Hsu et al. in view of Nishihama
      et al. as applied to claim 13 above, and further in view of Mitcham (US Patent
      Application Pub. No.:  2005/0073216 A1).\\nFor claim 15, Hsu et al. in view
      of Nishihama et al. disclose the claimed invention except for coupling a first
      coupling component to a first end of each bar of the plurality of bars comprising
      brazing the first coupling component to the first end of each bar of the plurality
      of bars, and wherein coupling a second coupling component to a second end of
      each bar of the plurality of bars opposite the first end comprising brazing
      the second coupling component to the second end of each bar of the plurality
      of bars.  Mitcham discloses brazing the first and second coupling component
      (reference numeral 34) to the ends of the plurality of bars (reference numeral
      31, see figure 3, and paragraph [0027]), and it would have been obvious to include
      this configuration of Mitcham in the inventions of Hsu et al. in view of Nishihama
      et al. since the invention of Mitcham is concerned with reducing manufacturing
      costs (see paragraph [0042]), the same concerns as those of the applicants.
      \ \\n Claims 17 and 18 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable
      over Hsu et al. in view of Kincaid and Nishihama et al. as applied to claim
      16 above, and further in view of Lang et al. (US Patent Application Pub. No.:
      \ 2009/0079289 A1).\\nFor claim 17, Hsu et al. in view of Kincaid and Nishihama
      et al. disclose the claimed invention except for each rotor bar of the plurality
      of rotor bars further comprising a cladding configured to enhance bonding between
      the metallic covering and the metallic bar component.  Lang et al. disclose
      rotor bars (reference numeral 28) with metallic cladding material (reference
      numeral 29, see figures 1-4), and it would have been obvious to include this
      material of Lang et al. for bonding between the metallic covering and the metallic
      bar component of Hsu et al. in view of Kincaid and Nishihama et al. since the
      invention of Lang et al. is concerned with the efficiency of the rotor (see
      paragraph [0006]), and a person of ordinary skill would have applied this technique
      for the purpose of improving the efficiency of the device.  \\nFor claim 18,
      Hsu et al. in view of Kincaid, Nishihama et al., and Lang et al. disclose the
      claimed invention including the metallic bar comprising at least one of copper,
      nickel, and silver (Hsu et al., see column 2, lines 45-50), but do not specifically
      teach the cladding comprising aluminum.  Lang et al. disclose the cladding material
      being aluminum (see paragraph [0043]), and it would have been obvious to include
      this material of Lang et al. in the inventions of Hsu et al. in view of Kincaid,
      Nishihama et al., and Lang et al. since the invention of Lang et al. is concerned
      with the efficiency of the rotor (see paragraph [0006]), and a person of ordinary
      skill would have applied this technique for the purpose of improving the efficiency
      of the device.  \\n\"],\n        \"sections.submissionDate\":\"2011-07-20T04:00:00Z\",\n

      the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious
      at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the
      art to which said subject matter pertains.  Patentability shall not be negatived
      by the manner in which the invention was made.\\n\\nClaims 1-3, 9, and 13 are
      rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Hsu et al. (US Patent
      No.: 6088906) in view of Nishihama et al. (US Patent Application Pub. No.:  2005/0156476
      A1).\\nFor claim 1, Hsu et al. disclose the claimed invention comprising: a
      plurality of rotor bars (reference numeral 16, figure 1); and a first coupling
      component (reference numeral 17, figure 2) configured to electrically couple
      the plurality of rotor bars together, wherein each rotor bar of the plurality
      of rotor bars comprises: a first metallic material (see column 2, lines 45-54)
      having a first electrical resistivity, the first metallic material having a
      first end and a second end opposite the first end (see figure 4), wherein the
      first coupling component is coupled to the first end of the first metallic material
      (see figures 2, 4).  Hsu et al. do not specifically disclose a second metallic
      material cast about the first material and having a second electrical resistivity
      greater than the first electrical resistivity.  \\nNishihama et al. disclose
      a rotor conductor (reference numeral 25, see figure 7) with a conductor portion
      (reference numeral 2511), i.e. second metallic material, having  a high resistivity
      being cast on the lower conductor portion (reference numeral 2521) having a
      lower resistivity (see paragraph [0053], and figure 7).  \\nIt would have been
      obvious to include the conductor configuration as taught by Nishihama et al.
      for the rotor bars of Hsu et al., since the invention of Nishihama et al. is
      related to providing high efficiency for the electrical machine (see paragraph
      [0007]), which is the same goal as that of the applicants\u2019 invention.  \\nFor

      including the first metallic material comprising a copper bar (Hsu et al., see
      column 2, lines 45-50), but do not specifically disclose the second metallic

      et al. would constitute the second metallic material comprising aluminum, and
      it would have been obvious to include this configuration in the inventions of
      Hsu et al. in view of Nishihama et al. for the purpose of increasing the efficiency
      of the machine.  \\nFor claim 3, Hsu et al. disclose each rotor bar of the plurality
      of rotor bars (reference numeral 16) having a first end and a second end opposite
      the first end (see figure 4), and wherein the first coupling component (reference
      numeral 17) is electrically coupled to the first end of each rotor bar of the
      plurality of rotor bars (figure 4); and wherein the electric machine further
      comprises a second coupling component (reference numeral 18) coupled to the
      second end of each rotor bar of the plurality of  rotor bars, wherein the second
      coupling component is configured to electrically couple the plurality of rotor
      bars together (see figures 2, 4).  \\nFor claim 9, Hsu et al. disclose a plurality
      of bars (reference numeral 16, figure 1) inserted into a rotor bar housing (reference
      numeral 11, figure 1), wherein each bar of the plurality of bars comprises a
      first metallic material (see column 2, lines 45-54) having a first electrical
      resistivity; and a coupling component (reference numeral 17, figure 2) electrically
      coupling the plurality of bars together.  Hsu et al. do not specifically teach
      casting a second metallic material about the plurality of bars inserted into
      the rotor bar housing, wherein the second metallic material has a second electrical
      resistivity greater than the first electrical resistivity.  \\nNishihama et
      al. disclose a rotor conductor (reference numeral 25, see figure 7) with a conductor
      portion (reference numeral 2511), i.e. second metallic material, having a high
      resistivity being cast on the lower conductor portion (reference numeral 2521)
      having a lower resistivity (see paragraph [0053], and figure 7), which constitutes
      casting a second metallic material about the plurality of bars inserted into
      the rotor bar housing when combined with the invention of Hsu et al., wherein
      the second metallic material has a second electrical resistivity greater than
      the first electrical resistivity.  \\nIt would have been obvious to include
      the casting of the second metallic material with the resistivity as disclosed
      by Nishihama et al. in the invention of Hsu et al., since the invention of Nishihama
      et al. is related to providing high efficiency for the electrical machine (see
      paragraph [0007]), which is the same goal as that of the applicants\u2019 invention.
      \ \\n For claim 13, Hsu et al. disclose the electrically coupling of the plurality
      of bars together comprising coupling a first coupling component (reference numeral
      17) to a first end of each bar of the plurality of bars (figure 4); and coupling
      a second coupling component (reference numeral 18) to a second end of each bar
      of the plurality of bars opposite the first end (figures 2, 4).  \\n\\nClaims
      16, 19, and 20 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over
      Hsu et al. (US Patent No.: 6088906) in view of Kincaid (US Patent No.: 1524558)
      and Nishihama et al. (US Patent Application Pub. No.:  2005/0156476 A1).\\nFor
      claim 16, Hsu et al. disclose the claimed invention comprising: a plurality
      of rotor bars (reference numeral 16, figure 1); a first electrical coupling
      ring (reference numeral 17, figure 2) configured to electrically couple each
      rotor bar of the plurality of rotor bars together, wherein each rotor bar of
      the plurality of rotor bars comprises: a metallic bar (see column 2, lines 45-54)
      comprising a first material having a first electrical resistivity.  Hsu et al.
      do not specifically disclose a metallic covering surrounding at least a majority
      of the metallic bar, the metallic covering having a second electrical resistivity
      greater than the first electrical resistivity.  \\nKincaid discloses a metallic
      bar (reference numeral 3) with a metallic covering (reference numeral 5) surrounding
      a majority of the metallic bar (see figure 1), and Nishihama et al. disclose
      a rotor conductor (reference numeral 25, see figure 7) with a conductor portion
      (reference numeral 2511) having a high resistivity being cast on the lower conductor
      portion (reference numeral 2521) having a lower resistivity (see paragraph [0053],
      and figure 7), and when applying the resistivity of these portions as disclosed
      by Nishihama et al. to the bar and the metallic covering of Kincaid, this would
      constitute the metallic covering having a second electrical resistivity greater
      than the first electrical resistivity.  \\nIt would have been obvious to include
      the covering of Kincaid and the resistivity of Nishihama et al. to the invention
      of Hsu et al., since the invention of Kincaid is concerned with the efficiency
      of the device (see lines 12-16), and also the invention of Nishihama et al.
      is related to providing high efficiency for the electrical machine (see paragraph
      [0007]), which is the same goal as that of the applicants\u2019 invention.  \\nFor
      claim 19, Hsu et al. in view of Kincaid and Nishihama et al. disclose the claimed
      invention including a second electrical coupling ring (Hsu et al., reference
      numeral 18) configured to electrically couple each rotor bar of the plurality
      of rotor bars together (Hsu et al., see figures 2, 4); but do not specifically
      teach an insulating material coupled to the first and second coupling rings
      and to the metallic bar of each rotor bar, wherein the insulating material is
      configured to at least partially isolate the first and second coupling rings
      and the metallic bar of each rotor bar from the metallic covering of each rotor
      bar.  Kincaid disclose end rings being secured by insulating material (see lines
      55-58), which when combined with the metallic bar and covering of Hsu et al.
      in view of Kincaid and Nishihama et al. would constitute the insulating material
      configured to at least partially isolate the first and second coupling rings
      and the metallic bar of each rotor bar from the metallic covering of each rotor
      bar, and it would have been obvious to include the teachings of Kincaid in the
      inventions of Hsu et al. in view of Kincaid and Nishihama et al. since Kincaid
      is concerned with the efficiency of the device (see lines 12-16), which is the
      same as that of the applicants\u2019 invention.  \\nFor claim 20, Hsu et al.
      in view of Kincaid and Nishihama et al. disclose the claimed invention except
      for the metallic covering being casted to the metallic bar, and wherein the
      metallic covering comprises aluminum.  Kincaid further discloses the metallic
      covering casted to the metallic bar (figure 1), and using a material such as
      aluminum for a rotor bar is a known skill in the art as exhibited by Hsu et
      al. (see column 2, lines 46, 59-63), of which when applied to the metallic covering
      of Kincaid would constitute the metallic covering comprising aluminum, and it
      would have been obvious to include this configuration in the inventions of Hsu
      et al. in view of Kincaid and Nishihama et al. for the purpose of increasing
      the efficiency of the machine.  \\n\\nClaim 4 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a)
      as being unpatentable over Hsu et al. in view of Nishihama et al. as applied
      to claim 3 above, and further in view of Avakian et al. (US Patent No.: 5793145).\\nFor
      claim 4, Hsu et al. in view of Nishihama et al. disclose the claimed invention
      except for a first cap screwed to a first end of the first metallic material;
      and a second cap screwed to a second end of the first metallic material opposite
      the first end of the first metallic material.  Avakian et al. disclose end caps
      (reference numeral 196) being disposed at first and second ends of the rotor
      (reference numeral 124, see figure 5), and it would have been obvious to include
      the cap configuration for the ends of the metallic material of Hsu et al. in
      view of Nishihama et al. since the invention of Avakian et al. is related to
      improving the sensitivity of the rotor to magnetic fields (see column 2, lines
      45-50), which would contribute to applicant's goal of positively affecting the
      efficiency of the machine.  \\n\\nClaim 10 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a)
      as being unpatentable over Hsu et al. in view of Nishihama et al. as applied
      to claim 9 above, and further in view of Barney (US Patent No.: 2991378).\\nFor
      claim 10, Hsu et al. in view of Nishihama et al. disclose the claimed invention
      except for coupling an electrical insulator to each bar of the plurality of
      bars.  Barney discloses rotor bars (reference numeral 24, figure 2) coupled
      with an insulator (reference numeral 24), and it would have been obvious to
      include this insulator of Barney in the invention of Hsu et al. in view of Nishihama
      et al. since the invention of Barney is concerned with the manufacturing costs
      of the electrical device (see column 1, lines 53-58), the same concerns as those
      of the applicant.  \\n\\nClaims 11 and 12 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a)
      as being unpatentable over Hsu et al. in view of Nishihama et al. as applied
      to claim 9 above, and further in view of Lang et al. (US Patent Application
      Pub. No.:  2009/0079289 A1).\\nFor claim 11, Hsu et al. in view of Nishihama
      et al. disclose the claimed invention except for cladding each bar of the plurality
      of bars with a metallic cladding material.  Lang et al. disclose rotor bars
      (reference numeral 28) with metallic cladding material (reference numeral 29,
      see figures 1-4), and it would have been obvious to include this material of
      Lang et al. in the invention of Hsu et al. in view of Nishihama et al. since
      the invention of Lang et al. is concerned with the efficiency of the rotor (see
      paragraph [0006]), and a person of ordinary skill would have applied this technique
      for the purpose of improving the efficiency of the device.  \\nFor claim 12,
      Hsu et al. in view of Nishihama et al. and Lang et al. disclose the claimed
      invention except for the cladding material comprising aluminum.  Lang et al.
      disclose the cladding material being aluminum (see paragraph [0043]), and it
      would have been obvious to include this material of Lang et al. in the invention
      of Hsu et al. in view of Nishihama et al. and Lang et al. since the invention
      of Lang et al. is concerned with the efficiency of the rotor (see paragraph
      [0006]), and a person of ordinary skill would have applied this technique for
      the purpose of improving the efficiency of the device.  \\n\\nClaim 15 is rejected
      under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Hsu et al. in view of Nishihama
      et al. as applied to claim 13 above, and further in view of Mitcham (US Patent
      Application Pub. No.:  2005/0073216 A1).\\nFor claim 15, Hsu et al. in view
      of Nishihama et al. disclose the claimed invention except for coupling a first
      coupling component to a first end of each bar of the plurality of bars comprising
      brazing the first coupling component to the first end of each bar of the plurality
      of bars, and wherein coupling a second coupling component to a second end of
      each bar of the plurality of bars opposite the first end comprising brazing
      the second coupling component to the second end of each bar of the plurality
      of bars.  Mitcham discloses brazing the first and second coupling component
      (reference numeral 34) to the ends of the plurality of bars (reference numeral
      31, see figure 3, and paragraph [0027]), and it would have been obvious to include
      this configuration of Mitcham in the inventions of Hsu et al. in view of Nishihama
      et al. since the invention of Mitcham is concerned with reducing manufacturing
      costs (see paragraph [0042]), the same concerns as those of the applicants.
      \ \\n\\nClaims 17 and 18 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable
      over Hsu et al. in view of Kincaid and Nishihama et al. as applied to claim
      16 above, and further in view of Lang et al. (US Patent Application Pub. No.:
      \ 2009/0079289 A1).\\nFor claim 17, Hsu et al. in view of Kincaid and Nishihama
      et al. disclose the claimed invention except for each rotor bar of the plurality
      of rotor bars further comprising a cladding configured to enhance bonding between
      the metallic covering and the metallic bar component.  Lang et al. disclose
      rotor bars (reference numeral 28) with metallic cladding material (reference
      numeral 29, see figures 1-4), and it would have been obvious to include this
      material of Lang et al. for bonding between the metallic covering and the metallic
      bar component of Hsu et al. in view of Kincaid and Nishihama et al. since the
      invention of Lang et al. is concerned with the efficiency of the rotor (see
      paragraph [0006]), and a person of ordinary skill would have applied this technique
      for the purpose of improving the efficiency of the device.  \\nFor claim 18,
      Hsu et al. in view of Kincaid, Nishihama et al., and Lang et al. disclose the
      claimed invention including the metallic bar comprising at least one of copper,
      nickel, and silver (Hsu et al., see column 2, lines 45-50), but do not specifically
      teach the cladding comprising aluminum.  Lang et al. disclose the cladding material
      being aluminum (see paragraph [0043]), and it would have been obvious to include
      this material of Lang et al. in the inventions of Hsu et al. in view of Kincaid,
      Nishihama et al., and Lang et al. since the invention of Lang et al. is concerned
      with the efficiency of the rotor (see paragraph [0006]), and a person of ordinary
      skill would have applied this technique for the purpose of improving the efficiency
      of the device.  \\n\\nAllowable Subject Matter\\nClaims 5-8, 14, and 21 are
      objected to as being dependent upon a rejected base claim, but would be allowable
      if rewritten in independent form including all of the limitations of the base
      claim and any intervening claims.\\nThe following is a statement of reasons
      for the indication of allowable subject matter:  While the prior art of record
      discloses some of the applicant's invention as explained in the present action,
      the references do not sufficiently disclose the combination of features including
      the first metallic material comprising a copper bar and the second metallic
      material comprising aluminum, the first metallic material having a first electrical
      resistivity, the second metallic material cast about the first material and
      having a second electrical resistivity greater than the first electrical resistivity,
      each rotor bar of the plurality of rotor bars having a first end and a second
      end opposite the first end, the first coupling component being electrically
      coupled to the first end of each rotor bar of the plurality of rotor bars; the
      electric machine further comprising a second coupling component coupled to the
      second end of each rotor bar of the plurality of rotor bars, wherein the second
      coupling component is configured to electrically couple the plurality of rotor
      bars together, and the second metallic material also being cast about portions
      of the first and second coupling components as disclosed in the invention of
      claim 5.  The prior art also does not sufficiently disclose the combination
      of features including casting a second metallic material about the plurality
      of bars inserted into the rotor bar housing, the second metallic material having
      a second electrical resistivity greater than the first electrical resistivity,
      coupling the first coupling component to the first end of each bar of the plurality
      of bars; coupling the second coupling component to a second end of each bar
      of the plurality of bars opposite the first end, and compressing the first end
      of each bar of the plurality of bars such that a first portion of each bar of
      the plurality of bars deforms to overlap a portion of the first coupling component;
      and compressing the second end of each bar of the plurality of bars such that
      a second portion of each bar of the plurality of bars deforms to overlap a portion
      of the second coupling component as disclosed in the invention of claim 14.
      \ The prior art also does not sufficiently disclose the combination of features
      including the metallic bar comprising a first end and a second end opposite
      the first end, and the electric machine rotor bar further comprising a first
      screw cap coupled to the first end of the metallic bar; and a washer component
      about the first end of the metallic bar and positioned adjacent to a portion
      of the first screw cap and the first electrical coupling ring, wherein the metallic
      bar is electrically coupled to the first electrical coupling ring via the portion
      of the first screw cap and the washer component as disclosed in the invention
      of claim 21.  \\nClaims 6-8 are dependent upon claim 5.  \\n\\nConclusion\\nThe
      prior art made of record and not relied upon is considered pertinent to applicant's

      relating to simulating an analog audio mixer. The claim in Example 38 does not
      explicitly recites mathematical relation unlike the current claims. \\nThe Examiner
      respectfully submits that the claims explicitly recite a mathematical concept
      and are not analogous to those of Example 38. The claim limitation of \u201Cequally
      dividing the pre-defined interval in N sub- intervals, whereby all of the N
      sub-intervals together cover the pre-defined interval and whereby there is no
      overlap of any one of the N sub-intervals with any other of the N sub- intervals\u201D
      does claim a mathematical step, which is the step of \u201Cdividing the pre-defined
      interval in N sub- intervals\u201D. It can be seen in the specification of the
      claimed invention states that \u201CAs all sub-intervals of selected points
      already have low discrepancy properties, the sub-interval that happened to be
      assigned to a failing computation unit may be further divided into sub-sub-intervals.
      Based on the original low discrepancy sequencing, the data objects belonging
      to points that were assigned to the failing computation unit may be uniquely
      re-assigned to selected ones of the computing units that have not failed, whereby
      all of the remaining computing units receive a share of these data objects\u201D
      [0043]. \\nAs discussed in the Specification, \u201Cdivided into\u201D has a
      mathematical relationship as the word \u201Cdividing\u201D is a mathematical
      function. The instant claim explicitly states \u201Carranging the points in
      a low discrepancy sequence within a pre-defined interval\u201D and \u201Cassigning
      exclusively one of the N computing units to exclusively one of the N sub-intervals\u201D
      in steps of Claim 1, and the claims steps are a mathematical concept/process.
      \\n\\tThe applicant also argues that \u201Cthe \\\"arranging\\\" and \\\"assigning\\\"
      steps, along with the \\\"equally dividing\\\" step below do not recite a mental
      process \\\"because the steps, as claimed, are not practically performed in
      the human mind\u201D, (page 3). The feature \u201Cequally dividing\u201D is
      a mental process that also may use a computer to perform this function which
      is appropriate for a mental step according to the 2019 PEG. The applicant is
      merely claiming that concept performed on a generic computer, and thus, the
      steps recite a mental process.\\n\\tThe applicant also argues that \u201CApplicant
      disagrees with the Examiner's conclusion that \\\"the claim elements do not
      reflect an improvement to other technology or technical field, and therefore,
      do not integrate the judicial exception into a practical application\\\", (page
      3). \\nThe examiner respectfully disagrees. The claims do not contain additional
      elements that are indicative of integration into a practical application and
      improvement of technology.  For example, no improvement to computer technology
      exists as the computing unit is a generic computer. Improvements in geological
      imagery relate to improvements to the abstract idea itself.\\nHence, the Examiner
      submits that the rejection of Claim 1 is proper.\\nThe dependent Claims 2-15
      are considered part of an expanded abstract idea of the independent Claim 1,
      and therefore, also ineligible.\\n\\n\\nClaim Rejections - 35 USC \xA7 101\\n35
      U.S.C. 101 reads as follows:\\nWhoever invents or discovers any new and useful
      process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful
      improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions
      and requirements of this title.\\n\\n\\nClaims 1-15 are rejected under 35 U.S.C.
      101 because the claimed invention is directed to a judicial exception (i.e.,
      a law of nature, a natural phenomenon, or an abstract idea) without significantly
      more.\\nSpecifically, representative Claim 1 recites:\\nA method of processing
      a geospatial dataset, comprising steps of: providing a geospatial dataset comprising
      a plurality of data objects distributed in a multi-dimensional grid of points;
      arranging the points in a low-discrepancy sequence within in a pre-defined interval,
      wherein each of the points receives one unique output value of a quasi-random
      generator within in said pre-defined interval (the step of \u201Carranging the
      points in a low-discrepancy sequence within in a pre-defined interval\u201D
      is merely a mathematical concept/process, therefore, it is considered to be
      an abstract idea); providing a distributed computer system having N computing
      units available for use, whereby N \u2264 2; equally dividing the pre-defined
      interval in N sub- intervals, whereby all of the N sub-intervals together cover
      the pre-defined interval and whereby there is no overlap of any one of the N
      sub-intervals with any other of the N sub- intervals (the step of \u201Cwhereby
      all of the N sub-intervals together cover the pre-defined interval and there
      is no overlap of any one of the N sub-intervals with any other of the N sub-
      intervals\u201D is merely a mental processes, therefore, it is considered to
      be an abstract idea); assigning exclusively one of the N computing units to
      exclusively one of the N sub-intervals and, for all n within 1 \u2264 n \u2264
      N, assigning the data objects of all points that have received the output value
      that lies within an nth sub- interval of the N sub-intervals to an nth  computing
      unit of said N computing units (the step of \u201Cassigning exclusively one
      of the N computing units to exclusively one of the N sub-intervals\u201D is
      merely a mathematical concept, therefore, it is considered to be an abstract
      idea); subjecting a subset of the data objects that have been distributed over
      the N computing units to processing operations by computer readable instructions
      on each of the N computing units.\\nUnder the Step 1 of the eligibility analysis,
      we determine whether the claims are to a statutory category by considering whether
      the claimed subject matter falls within the four statutory categories of patentable
      subject matter identified by 35 U.S.C. 101: Process, machine, manufacture, or
      composition of matter. The above claim is considered to be in a statutory category
      (process).\\nUnder the Step 2A, Prong One, we consider whether the claim recites
      a judicial exception (abstract idea). In the above claim, the highlighted portion
      constitutes an abstract idea because, under a broadest reasonable interpretation,
      it recites limitations that fall into/recite an abstract idea exceptions. Specifically,
      under the 2019 Revised Patent Subject matter Eligibility Guidance, it falls
      into the grouping of subject matter when recited as such in a claim that covers
      mathematical concepts (mathematical relationships, mathematical formulas or
      equations, mathematical calculations) and  mental processes (concepts performed
      in the human mind including observations, evaluations, judgments, opinions).\\nNext,
      under the Step 2A, Prong Two, we consider whether the claim that recites a judicial
      exception is integrated into a practical application.\\nIn this step, we evaluate
      whether the claim recites additional elements that integrate the exception into
      a practical application of that exception.\\nThe above claim comprise the following
      additional elements:\\n\u2022    In Claim 1: providing a geospatial dataset
      comprising a plurality of data objects distributed in a multi-dimensional grid
      of points; providing a distributed computer system, and N computing units; and
      subjecting a subset of the data objects that have been distributed over the
      N computing units to processing operations by computer readable instructions
      on each of the N computing units.\\nThe additional element of \u201Cproviding
      a geospatial dataset comprising a plurality of data objects distributed in a
      multi-dimensional grid of points\u201D is not qualified for a meaningful limitation
      because it represents a mere data processing step and only adds an insignificant
      extra-solution activity to the judicial exception. The additional element \u201Cproviding
      a distributed computer system, and N computing units\u201D is a computer (generic
      computer) that is generally recited and is not qualified as a particular machine.\\nThis
      element is needed to execute the abstract idea as recited in the additional
      element/step of \u201Csubjecting a subset of the data objects that have been
      distributed over the N computing units to processing operations by computer
      readable instructions on each of the N computing units\u201D which only adds
      only insignificant-extra solution activity to the judicial exception. In Claim
      1, the preamble \u201CA method of processing a geospatial dataset\u201D is not
      qualified for a meaningful limitation because it is only generally links the
      use of the judicial exception to a particular technological environment or field
      of use.  \\nIn conclusion, the above additional elements, considered individually
      and in combination with the other claim elements do not reflect an improvement
      to other technology or technical field, and, therefore, do not integrate the
      judicial exception into a practical application. Therefore, the claims are directed
      to a judicial exception and require further analysis under the Step 2B.\\nHowever,
      the above claims, do not include additional elements that are sufficient to
      amount to significantly more than the judicial exception because they are generically
      recited and are well-understood/conventional in a relevant art as evidenced
      by the prior art of record (Step 2B analysis).\\nThe claims, therefore, are
      not patent eligible.\\nWith regards to the dependent claims, Claims 2-15 provide
      additional features/steps which are part of an expanded algorithm, so these
      limitations should be considered part of an expanded abstract idea of the independent
      claims (Step 2A, Prong One), recite no additional elements reflecting a practical
      application (Step 2A, Prong Two), and fail a \u201Csignificantly more\u201D
      test under the step 2B for the same reasons as discussed with regards to the
      independent claim.\\nThe dependent claims are, therefore, also ineligible.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nClaims
      1-15 do not have prior arts rejections but they are rejected under 35 U.S.C.

      shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made.\\n\"],\n
      \       \"sections.section103RejectionText\":[\"Claims 1-7, 9-17 & 19 are rejected
      under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Lenhardt et al.,
      US 5,350,469 in view of Schuler, US 2007/0068616.\\nWith regard to claims 1,
      12 & 19, Lenhardt teaches a well-known method for injecting gas into IG units,
      wherein panes (and an inner border of adhesive spacer  material) are positioned
      together near one edge, thereby forming a nonzero-angle (clearly depicted as
      being less than 10 degrees) which is just enough to form a gap for a heavy gas
      injection step which is carried out before pressing the panes together to form
      an IG unit, wherein additional blocking members (seal 36/brush 38) are used
      to seal the wedge-shaped gaps that form between the panes, thereby better retaining
      a heavy filling gas (throughout, e.g. abstract, [FIGS. 5, 7]).\\nWhile this
      reference does not expressly disclose whether the filling gas displaces air
      at a side of the cavity which is partially blocked with an element other than
      the spacer, it is believed that this would occur to some extent at the partially-blocked
      bottom seal 36/brush 38 inasmuch as that they are not perfectly fluid tight
      (and air would also be displaced out of the cavity formed within the spacer
      boundary), although the primary displacement of air would occur near the open
      top of the assembly.  In any event, Schuler (which cites Lenhardt) teaches the
      incorporation of numerous additional sealing members, first/second/third/fourth/fifth
      seals for different portions of the periphery an IG assembly (throughout, e.g.
      abstract, [0047-0048, 0053 & FIG. 2]).  It would have been obvious for one of
      ordinary skill in the art to incorporate additional partial blockers of Schuler
      into the process of Lenhardt, in order to further enclose the cavity and better
      retain filling gas (while necessarily leaving some space for displaced air to
      flow out).\\nWith regard to claim 2, seal 36 of Lenhardt is understood to fall
      within this range [FIG. 7] as is seal 6 of Schuler [FIG. 2].\\nWith regard to
      claim 3, the seal 36 of Lenhardt starts at an injection end [FIG. 7].\\nWith
      regard to claim 4, an injecting nozzle portion is arranged over at least a portion
      of the length of the pane in Lenhardt [Col. 7, 57-64]. \\nWith regard to claims
      5 & 15-16, nozzle 31 of Lenhardt is understood to fall within the range of 10-100%
      [FIG. 6] and further, adjusting the span of nozzles used, depending on the size
      and configuration of the work, would have been well within the realm of ordinary
      skill.  Applicant\u2019s specification has also not given any superior and unexpected
      results for any of the ranges claimed.\\nWith regard to claims 6 & 17, in the
      above combination, each of the wedge-shaped gap sides of the IG assembly are
      partially blocked by a seal member, wherein the injection portion is stationary
      throughout filling.  With regard to claim 17, again, further adjusting this
      span of nozzles used, depending on the size and configuration of the work, would
      have been well within the realm of ordinary skill.\\nWith regard to claims 7,
      a bottom side in Lenhardt where the spacer & the seals combine to block the
      side can be considered \u2018fully blocked\u2019 and the opposite, upper side
      with a second seal & room to vent displaced air can be considered \u2018partially
      blocked.\u2019\\nWith regard to claims 9-10, a gas fill level for an assembly
      of measured dimensions is determined by an array of sensors [Col. 9, 29-47]
      and common sense dictates that the gas is naturally injected \u2018proportional\u2019
      to the work dimensions.\\nWith regard to claim 11, while the prior art does
      not expressly disclose three-layer panels, duplication of this nature would
      not be patentably distinguishing; see MPEP 2144.04(VI)B.\\nWith regard to claim
      13, while Lenhardt does not expressly disclose using a porous gas injection
      belt, these were conventional in this art as shown by Schuler [0027 & FIG. 2],
      which would have been an obvious alternative design for one of ordinary skill.
      \\nWith regard to claim 14, the prior art removes a gas before filling with
      a gas [Col. 4, 55-68].\\n Claims 8, 18 & 20-21 are rejected under pre-AIA  35
      U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Lenhardt et al., US 5,350,469 in view
      of Schuler, US 2007/0068616 and further in view of Lenhardt et al., US 5,762,739.\\nWith
      regard to claims 8 & 18, the teachings of Lenhardt \u2018469 & Schuler have
      been detailed above, and also, a blocked bottom side and the injection side
      form a corner near the injection means, with the injection portion near said
      corner, as seen in Lenhardt \u2018469 [FIGS. 6-7].  While these references do
      not expressly disclose an injection portion which changes in length during filling,
      the use of a controllable multi-zone injection portion was well-known in the
      art, as shown for example by Lenhardt \u2018739 (throughout, e.g. abstract,
      [FIGS. 5, 9]).  It would have been obvious for one of ordinary skill in the
      art to combine the teachings of Lenhardt \u2018739 with those of Lenhardt \u2018469
      & Schuler, in order to provide a process with independently controllable gas
      flows to more efficiently displace air.  With regard to claim 18, adjusting
      this span of nozzles used, depending on the size and configuration of the work,
      would have been well within the realm of ordinary skill.\\nWith regard to claim
      20, Lenhardt \u2018739 also teaches flow rate variation [FIG. 17], and with
      regard to claim 21, again, it would have also been obvious to vary the nozzles
      used, either to vary said rate by an obvious alternative means, or to better
      control gas filling & distribution.\\n\"],\n        \"sections.submissionDate\":\"2018-10-10T04:00:00Z\",\n

      ACTION\\nClaims 1-21 are pending as amended on 09/11/18.\\n\\nResponse to Amendment\\nThis
      non-final action is a response to the amendment & RCE filed on September 11,
      2018.  Claim 1 has been amended as a result of the previous action; the rejections
      have been redone accordingly.  Claims 20-21 have been added.\\n\\nClaim Objections\\nClaim
      1 is objected to because of the following informalities: in line 10, the phrase
      \u201Csaid at least one of [ ] sides\u201D appears to be missing a \u201Cthe\u201D.
      \ Appropriate correction is required.\\n\\nClaim Rejections - 35 USC \xA7 103\\nThe
      following is a quotation of pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) which forms the basis
      for all obviousness rejections set forth in this Office action:\\n(a) A patent
      may not be obtained though the invention is not identically disclosed or described
      as set forth in section 102 of this title, if the differences between the subject
      matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter
      as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person
      having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.  Patentability
      shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made.\\n\\nClaims
      1-7, 9-17 & 19 are rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable
      over Lenhardt et al., US 5,350,469 in view of Schuler, US 2007/0068616.\\nWith
      regard to claims 1, 12 & 19, Lenhardt teaches a well-known method for injecting
      gas into IG units, wherein panes (and an inner border of adhesive spacer  material)
      are positioned together near one edge, thereby forming a nonzero-angle (clearly
      depicted as being less than 10 degrees) which is just enough to form a gap for
      a heavy gas injection step which is carried out before pressing the panes together
      to form an IG unit, wherein additional blocking members (seal 36/brush 38) are
      used to seal the wedge-shaped gaps that form between the panes, thereby better
      retaining a heavy filling gas (throughout, e.g. abstract, [FIGS. 5, 7]).\\nWhile
      this reference does not expressly disclose whether the filling gas displaces
      air at a side of the cavity which is partially blocked with an element other
      than the spacer, it is believed that this would occur to some extent at the
      partially-blocked bottom seal 36/brush 38 inasmuch as that they are not perfectly
      fluid tight (and air would also be displaced out of the cavity formed within
      the spacer boundary), although the primary displacement of air would occur near
      the open top of the assembly.  In any event, Schuler (which cites Lenhardt)
      teaches the incorporation of numerous additional sealing members, first/second/third/fourth/fifth
      seals for different portions of the periphery an IG assembly (throughout, e.g.
      abstract, [0047-0048, 0053 & FIG. 2]).  It would have been obvious for one of
      ordinary skill in the art to incorporate additional partial blockers of Schuler
      into the process of Lenhardt, in order to further enclose the cavity and better
      retain filling gas (while necessarily leaving some space for displaced air to
      flow out).\\nWith regard to claim 2, seal 36 of Lenhardt is understood to fall
      within this range [FIG. 7] as is seal 6 of Schuler [FIG. 2].\\nWith regard to
      claim 3, the seal 36 of Lenhardt starts at an injection end [FIG. 7].\\nWith
      regard to claim 4, an injecting nozzle portion is arranged over at least a portion
      of the length of the pane in Lenhardt [Col. 7, 57-64]. \\nWith regard to claims
      5 & 15-16, nozzle 31 of Lenhardt is understood to fall within the range of 10-100%
      [FIG. 6] and further, adjusting the span of nozzles used, depending on the size
      and configuration of the work, would have been well within the realm of ordinary
      skill.  Applicant\u2019s specification has also not given any superior and unexpected
      results for any of the ranges claimed.\\nWith regard to claims 6 & 17, in the
      above combination, each of the wedge-shaped gap sides of the IG assembly are
      partially blocked by a seal member, wherein the injection portion is stationary
      throughout filling.  With regard to claim 17, again, further adjusting this
      span of nozzles used, depending on the size and configuration of the work, would
      have been well within the realm of ordinary skill.\\nWith regard to claims 7,
      a bottom side in Lenhardt where the spacer & the seals combine to block the
      side can be considered \u2018fully blocked\u2019 and the opposite, upper side
      with a second seal & room to vent displaced air can be considered \u2018partially
      blocked.\u2019\\nWith regard to claims 9-10, a gas fill level for an assembly
      of measured dimensions is determined by an array of sensors [Col. 9, 29-47]
      and common sense dictates that the gas is naturally injected \u2018proportional\u2019
      to the work dimensions.\\nWith regard to claim 11, while the prior art does
      not expressly disclose three-layer panels, duplication of this nature would
      not be patentably distinguishing; see MPEP 2144.04(VI)B.\\nWith regard to claim
      13, while Lenhardt does not expressly disclose using a porous gas injection
      belt, these were conventional in this art as shown by Schuler [0027 & FIG. 2],
      which would have been an obvious alternative design for one of ordinary skill.
      \\nWith regard to claim 14, the prior art removes a gas before filling with
      a gas [Col. 4, 55-68].\\n\\nClaims 8, 18 & 20-21 are rejected under pre-AIA
      \ 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Lenhardt et al., US 5,350,469
      in view of Schuler, US 2007/0068616 and further in view of Lenhardt et al.,
      US 5,762,739.\\nWith regard to claims 8 & 18, the teachings of Lenhardt \u2018469
      & Schuler have been detailed above, and also, a blocked bottom side and the
      injection side form a corner near the injection means, with the injection portion
      near said corner, as seen in Lenhardt \u2018469 [FIGS. 6-7].  While these references
      do not expressly disclose an injection portion which changes in length during
      filling, the use of a controllable multi-zone injection portion was well-known
      in the art, as shown for example by Lenhardt \u2018739 (throughout, e.g. abstract,
      [FIGS. 5, 9]).  It would have been obvious for one of ordinary skill in the
      art to combine the teachings of Lenhardt \u2018739 with those of Lenhardt \u2018469
      & Schuler, in order to provide a process with independently controllable gas
      flows to more efficiently displace air.  With regard to claim 18, adjusting
      this span of nozzles used, depending on the size and configuration of the work,
      would have been well within the realm of ordinary skill.\\nWith regard to claim
      20, Lenhardt \u2018739 also teaches flow rate variation [FIG. 17], and with
      regard to claim 21, again, it would have also been obvious to vary the nozzles
      used, either to vary said rate by an obvious alternative means, or to better
      control gas filling & distribution.\\n\\n Response to Arguments\\nApplicant\u2019s
      arguments, see response, \u201CRemarks,\u201D filed September 11, 2018 with
      respect to the prior art rejections of the claims have been fully considered
      and are primarily drawn toward the claims as amended but are moot in light of
      the new grounds of rejection above.  Examiner notes that while Applicants have
      focused significantly on asserting the intended breadth of the scope of the
      limitation \u201Cpartially blocking\u201D, the claim language can reasonably
      be interpreted numerous ways and more detailed language should be added to better
      clarify the scope.  With regard to the amendment that air is pushed to escape,
      partial blocking of flexed IG assemblies to permit the controlled injection
      of heavy gas and the displacement of air via either suction assist or natural
      displacement was still known in this art at the time of the instant invention;
      see for example US 2007/0068616 and US 5,762,739.  The instant claims as written
      are still not considered to be patentably distinguishable over the teachings
      & suggestions of the prior art.\\n\\nConclusion\\nAny inquiry concerning this

      an examiner\u2019s statement of reasons for allowance:\\n\\nClaims 1, and 7-9
      each require a predetermined image capture object capturing an image of the
      object, for a left and right image, and determining a position and orientation
      of the object in the predetermined coordinate system, determining a position
      and orientation of left and right virtual cameras, synthesizing the virtual
      images with the real images and stereoscopically displaying them, calculating
      a distance in the predetermined coordinate system, and calculating a ration
      between the unit length in the predetermined coordinate system and a distance
      in the real world between the right and left eye real cameras.\\nThe prior arts
      on record teach the following:  a left and right camera to take pictures of
      an object and synthesize virtual and real images to form a stereoscopic image
      and perform interactions between the object and a user.\\n However, none of
      the prior arts disclose determining a ratio between unit length in the real
      world and in the predetermined coordinate system as stated in claims 1, and

      of the left and right images (e.g., figure 14, numeral 12), by applying a \u201Cband
      pass filter\u201D at paragraph 0070, Inoue does not teach:\\n\u201Ca plurality

      larger contiguous portion and wherein at least some of the defined values differ
      from one another for each plurality of portions\u201D as recited in claim 9.\\nTabata
      teaches the concept of filtering/blending an area of interest with the surroundings,
      including the aforementioned missing limitation, as follows:\\nRefer to Figure
      3(b), and see, \\n \u201CFor example, the inside of the ellipse 13 and the inside
      of the ellipse 14 are set as a transmission area (the area not masked). Next,
      in the area between the ellipses 15, 13 and the area between the ellipses 16,
      14, the transmittance gradation is created with the transmission ratio increasing
      from outside (ellipses 15, 16 side) toward inside (the ellipses 13, 14 side).
      This gradation may be either linear or nonlinear. The area constituting the
      outside of the ellipse 15 and the outside of the ellipse 16 is set as a non-transmission
      area (masked area). \\nBy this mask image generation step S02, the data of the
      mask image 7 is output. The mask image 7 may be generated using any figure other
      than the ellipse. For example, it may be generated using a special figure in
      the shape of the upper half portion of the person\u201D at column 11, line 48.
      \\nIt would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to one of ordinary
      skill in the art to combine the teaching of Tabata with the filtering of the
      \u201Cattention area\u201D of Inoue, in order to blend the filtered attention
      areas into the surroundings to avoid and prevent an abrupt transition to the
      background, thereby producing a more aesthetically pleasing image.  The prior
      art collectively includes each element claimed (though not all in the same reference),
      and one of ordinary skill in the art could have combined the elements in the
      manner explained above using known engineering design, interface and/or programming
      techniques, without changing a \u201Cfundamental\u201D operating principle of
      Inoue, while the teaching of Tabata continues to perform the same function as
      originally taught prior to being combined, in order to produce the repeatable
      and predictable result of highlighting an attention area in a binocular image
      via blending of  the attention area into the background.  It is for at least

      following is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 103(a) which forms the basis for all obviousness
      rejections set forth in this Office action:\\n(a) A patent may not be obtained
      though the invention is not identically disclosed or described as set forth
      in section 102 of this title, if the differences between the subject matter
      sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as
      a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person
      having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.  Patentability
      shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made.\\n\\nClaims
      1 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable Inoue et al. (US
      2011/0002533 A1) in view of Tabata et al. (US 7,587,083 B2).\\nWhile Inoue teaches
      modifying a portion of the left and right images (e.g., figure 14, numeral 12),
      by applying a \u201Cband pass filter\u201D at paragraph 0070, Inoue does not
      teach:\\n\u201Ca plurality of portions for the left image are modified and a
      plurality of corresponding portions for right image are modified, each plurality
      of portions forming a larger contiguous portion and wherein at least some of
      the defined values differ from one another for each plurality of portions\u201D
      as recited in claim 9.\\nTabata teaches the concept of filtering/blending an
      area of interest with the surroundings, including the aforementioned missing
      limitation, as follows:\\nRefer to Figure 3(b), and see, \\n \u201CFor example,
      the inside of the ellipse 13 and the inside of the ellipse 14 are set as a transmission
      area (the area not masked). Next, in the area between the ellipses 15, 13 and
      the area between the ellipses 16, 14, the transmittance gradation is created
      with the transmission ratio increasing from outside (ellipses 15, 16 side) toward
      inside (the ellipses 13, 14 side). This gradation may be either linear or nonlinear.
      The area constituting the outside of the ellipse 15 and the outside of the ellipse
      16 is set as a non-transmission area (masked area). \\nBy this mask image generation
      step S02, the data of the mask image 7 is output. The mask image 7 may be generated
      using any figure other than the ellipse. For example, it may be generated using
      a special figure in the shape of the upper half portion of the person\u201D
      at column 11, line 48. \\nIt would have been obvious at the time the invention
      was made to one of ordinary skill in the art to combine the teaching of Tabata
      with the filtering of the \u201Cattention area\u201D of Inoue, in order to blend
      the filtered attention areas into the surroundings to avoid and prevent an abrupt
      transition to the background, thereby producing a more aesthetically pleasing
      image.  The prior art collectively includes each element claimed (though not
      all in the same reference), and one of ordinary skill in the art could have
      combined the elements in the manner explained above using known engineering
      design, interface and/or programming techniques, without changing a \u201Cfundamental\u201D
      operating principle of Inoue, while the teaching of Tabata continues to perform
      the same function as originally taught prior to being combined, in order to
      produce the repeatable and predictable result of highlighting an attention area
      in a binocular image via blending of  the attention area into the background.
