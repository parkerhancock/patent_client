                <claim>
                    <claim-text>1. Apparatus for manufacturing green bricks from clay for the brick manufacturing industry, comprising a circulating conveyor carrying mould containers combined to mould container parts, a reservoir for clay arranged above the mould containers, means for carrying clay out of the reservoir into the mould containers, means for pressing and trimming clay in the mould containers, means for supplying and placing take-off plates for the green bricks and means for discharging green bricks released from the mould containers,characterized in that the apparatus further comprises means for moving the mould container parts filled with green bricks such that a protruding edge is formed on at least one side of the green bricks.</claim-text>
                    <claim-text>2. Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the edge-forming means are adapted to move the mould container parts repeatedly for a certain period.</claim-text>
                    <claim-text>3. Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the edge-forming means are adapted to move the mould container parts substantially transversely of the transporting direction.</claim-text>
                    <claim-text>4. Apparatus as claimed in any of the foregoing claims, wherein the edge-forming means comprise a frame which is adapted to engage individually on a mould container part.</claim-text>
                    <claim-text>5. Apparatus as claimed in claim 4, wherein the frame spans the mould container part and is provided on both sides with stop members which are situated during operation at the location of the side walls of the mould container part.</claim-text>
                    <claim-text>6. Apparatus as claimed in claim 5, wherein the stop members are provided with stop surfaces which preferably comprise plastic.</claim-text>
                    <claim-text>7. Apparatus as claimed in claim 5 or 6, wherein the mould container parts are provided on their side walls with stop surfaces which preferably comprise plastic.</claim-text>
                    <claim-text>8. Apparatus as claimed in claim 4, 5, 6 or 7, wherein the edge-forming means comprise an eccentric drive for the frame.</claim-text>
                    <claim-text>9. Apparatus as claimed in any of the foregoing claims, wherein each mould container part is provided with a number of spacer members for supporting the take-off plates at a distance above the green bricks.</claim-text>
                    <claim-text>10. Apparatus as claimed in any of the foregoing claims, wherein the mould container parts are fixed movably onto the conveyor with some clearance in the direction of movement.</claim-text>
                    <claim-text>11. Apparatus as claimed in claim 10, wherein the conveyor is a chain conveyor and the mould container parts are coupled with some clearance in the direction of movement to a chain part connectable to the chain.</claim-text>
