      lang="EN"><claim><claim-text>1. Apparatus for manufacturing green bricks from
      clay for the brick manufacturing industry, comprising a circulating conveyor
      carrying mould containers combined to mould container parts, a reservoir for
      clay arranged above the mould containers, means for carrying clay out of the
      reservoir into the mould containers, means for pressing and trimming clay in
      the mould containers, means for supplying and placing take-off plates for the
      green bricks and means for discharging green bricks released from the mould
      containers,characterized in that the apparatus further comprises means for moving
      the mould container parts filled with green bricks such that a protruding edge
      is formed on at least one side of the green bricks.</claim-text><claim-text>2.
      Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the edge-forming means are adapted
      to move the mould container parts repeatedly for a certain period.</claim-text><claim-text>3.
      Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the edge-forming means are adapted
      to move the mould container parts substantially transversely of the transporting
      direction.</claim-text><claim-text>4. Apparatus as claimed in any of the foregoing
      claims, wherein the edge-forming means comprise a frame which is adapted to
      engage individually on a mould container part.</claim-text><claim-text>5. Apparatus
      as claimed in claim 4, wherein the frame spans the mould container part and
      is provided on both sides with stop members which are situated during operation
      at the location of the side walls of the mould container part.</claim-text><claim-text>6.
      Apparatus as claimed in claim 5, wherein the stop members are provided with
      stop surfaces which preferably comprise plastic.</claim-text><claim-text>7.
      Apparatus as claimed in claim 5 or 6, wherein the mould container parts are
      provided on their side walls with stop surfaces which preferably comprise plastic.</claim-text><claim-text>8.
      Apparatus as claimed in claim 4, 5, 6 or 7, wherein the edge-forming means comprise
      an eccentric drive for the frame.</claim-text><claim-text>9. Apparatus as claimed
      in any of the foregoing claims, wherein each mould container part is provided
      with a number of spacer members for supporting the take-off plates at a distance
      above the green bricks.</claim-text><claim-text>10. Apparatus as claimed in
      any of the foregoing claims, wherein the mould container parts are fixed movably
      onto the conveyor with some clearance in the direction of movement.</claim-text><claim-text>11.
      Apparatus as claimed in claim 10, wherein the conveyor is a chain conveyor and
      the mould container parts are coupled with some clearance in the direction of
      movement to a chain part connectable to the chain.</claim-text></claim></claims></ftxt:fulltext-document></ftxt:fulltext-documents></ops:world-patent-data>'
